Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Hornbuckle, President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; and Grant Bowie, CEO and Executive Director of MGM China Holdings Limited.","Participants are currently in a listen-only mode. After the company's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please also note that today's event is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo. Sir, you may begin.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, Jamie. And good morning and welcome everyone to the MGM Resorts International first quarter 2017 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and we have furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in the press release, which is also available on our website. Please note that our supplemental earnings deck is posted on our website, which we hope you will continue to find helpful.","Finally, this presentation is being recorded. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Jim Murren.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We started of the year in 2017 very well, and I think that the first quarter results further demonstrates the power of the MGM platform and the strategies which we talked about and have executed upon. Also, the strength of the markets in which we operate and many of the investments that we have made.","I'm really pleased to announce that these earnings on an earnings per share basis tripled in the first quarter. And our net revenue and adjusted EBITDA grew 23% and 36%, respectively. On a same-store basis, our domestic resorts grew net revenue and EBITDA by 6% and 15% respectively, driven primarily by continued strength here in Las Vegas.","Borgata, which we consolidated into our portfolio last year, had an excellent quarter, and National Harbor is off to a great start in its first full quarter of operations. In Macau, MGM China's strong results continued to demonstrate our ability there to consistently outperform our fair share in that very dynamic market.","First, here at home, in the first quarter in Las Vegas, we achieved Strip revenue and EBITDA growth of 7% and 17%, respectively. We really are executing across all segments of our business including hotel, casino, food and beverage and entertainment. The quarter, of course, was aided by a strong convention business calendar and a favorable Easter calendar shift.","But we also continued to drive margin improvement while delivering consistent quality experiences to our customers. In the first quarter, Strip margins grew 290 basis points to 33%, driven in part by strong revenue growth and our company-wide continuous improvement efforts to maximize the profitability of our business. Table game hold was modestly above our normal range. Our normal range is of between 21% and 25%. Also in the first quarter, if you recall, we guided to a 7% Strip RevPAR. We ultimately achieved 8.6%.","Clearly, the quarter benefited from CON\/AGG and that calendar shift. However, even excluding these benefits, we would have grown RevPAR by approximately 4% in the first quarter. And this is due to the execution of the strategies we've discussed building a very strong convention base and maximizing all of our other channels including a good mix shift into FIT in the quarter.","CityCenter had an exceptional quarter. Both Aria and Vdara produced an all-time record quarter in revenue, EBITDA and margins. Aria ended the quarter just shy of $100 of EBITDA and margins of 36%, and they're nipping at Bellagio's heels. Bellagio had margins of 38%, so, of course, it's nice to say that Bellagio and Aria are clearly the market leaders here in terms of efficiency, margin, productivity, and Aria and Bellagio obviously continue to be top-performing assets within Las Vegas and, of course, the MGM portfolio.","This year the CityCenter board capitalized on these strong operating results to execute a dividend refinancing of the property. In April, CityCenter distributed a total of $600 million of ordinary and special dividends to its sponsors. To put this in perspective, over the past three years, CityCenter has paid out over $2 billion of dividends to its shareholders and remains very well capitalized with very prudent leverage and attractive free cash flow.","We're looking for further opportunities to grow and further opportunities to use our product offerings to maximize our ability to drive guest experiences. We're obviously ahead of the curve when we expanded the Mandalay Bay Convention Center. That's already delivered significant returns to us and have allowed us to grow our group business.","Aria is slated to open its 200,000-square-foot convention space expansion by early next year. And we're now in a position to begin working toward expanding MGM Grand's conference space. We're actually also looking at exploring some space here at Bellagio as well.","And work is progressing with the Sydell Group on the transformation of Monte Carlo to Park MGM and NoMad. We took our first step in December when we opened our 5,200 seat park theater and we will continue to rollout these new guest experiences and amenities, including a completely remodeled room product throughout this year and next.","We've also been working to work with our partners to find the best and most profitable outcomes for our results. We did this recently with Topgolf bringing an innovative and complementary entertainment concept to MGM Grand and the city, and we're going to do this again with an experience with Allied Esports in converting Luxor's nightclub space into the first Esports arena on the Strip.","Partnerships are not new to us. It's something we actually excel at and none is better evidenced in my mind than when we teamed up with AEG to create T-Mobile Arena. We just celebrated its first anniversary and it has already set new standards for not only venue design and amenities, but it is one of the busiest arenas in the world, validating our investment and our partnership with AEG. In fact, we just recently announced a long-term content deal with UFC and we're all looking forward to welcoming the city's first professional sports team, The Vegas Golden Knights, this fall.","Entertainment continues to be a key driver for our company and the primary reason people visit our resorts. And our forward calendar this year is shaping up well across all of our larger scale venues in the United States. And with T-Mobile and the new Park Theater, we're on-track to more than double the number of shows hosted in our large scale events this year versus last year.","Over on the East Coast, MGM National Harbor completed its first full quarter of operations and we are very pleased with how the property is performing overall. We finished the quarter as the market leader, commanding a 30% share in the region and the only property in the region with a fair share of premium.","Our table games are performing very well, with a win per unit per day of over $5,800, and poker is also running ahead of our expectations. Slots are doing well as well, with a $261 win per unit per day in the first quarter. And we believe that there's substantial opportunity to grow this as we optimize our slot floor and leverage our targeted marketing efforts.","And like any new property, it takes time to ramp-up that floor and build our database. But that said, we are pleased that we have added over 240,000 new members to our M life Rewards program. And we're very encouraged by the consistent pace of the sign-ups we continue to see. We know that we're off to a good start there, but we see opportunities to continue at National Harbor to grow revenue, grow margins and grow cash flows and we intend to do so.","Over in Atlantic City, Borgata posted another great quarter and is the undisputed leader in the market. In fact, they had a record March in slot revenue and continue to post strong top-line numbers. We're extremely pleased with how the acquisition has worked out for MGM Resorts and MGP. And our team at Borgata has done an outstanding job. That team and our teams across our company have been working seamlessly on the transition to our M life loyalty program which will be done this summer. And we believe that will positively impact both Borgata and the Las Vegas properties with cross-property play.","There may be some downtime because of the transition to the current rewards \u2013 from the current reward system to M life. But we've done this before and we expect to be able to minimize that disruption to our customers.","In Macau, MGM China reported a great first quarter with revenues increasing by 7% year-over-year and EBITDA increasing 25%. MGM Macau continues to capture more than our fair share despite the new competition in this very rapidly changing marketplace.","We continue to see growth and opportunity in our mass business supported by premium mass. And we remain optimistic about the market's recent uptick in VIP. Grant's on the line, and of course, he'll be available to talk about that.","We're progressing on the construction of MGM Cotai as we look forward to the opening of that second resort, our second resort in Macau, which we will open later this year. It will have roughly 1,400 hotel rooms and suites, great meeting space, spas, retail offerings, a very diverse lineup of F&B and Asia's first-of-its-kind theater. The entertainment component alone, we believe, will help drive greater diversification in the market and bring Macau further into this diversification of hospitality and global tourism.","So, looking ahead into the current quarter, our second quarter, this as we've been saying for a while, will be one of the toughest comparisons we have this year given the Easter calendar shift in April, and that's going to impact convention room nights.","Our second quarter of 2016 also benefited from higher-than-normal table games hold. It was specifically 25.6%. And as a result of those two factors, we believe our Strip revenues will be about flat, relatively consistent with the second quarter of last year, with casino revenues likely being down slightly and non-gaming revenues being up. And we're projecting Strip RevPAR to be up 1.5% to 2.5% against that tough comp. And margins will be probably essentially flat from a year ago.","We continue to expect our full-year targets to remain, as we've said, unchanged. We expect that we can achieve Las Vegas Strip revenue growth of the low to mid-single digits. We think that our RevPAR will grow 4% or 5% for the year. We expect margin improvement this year of 50 basis points to 100 basis points versus where we ended up in 2016. And the macro picture here in Las Vegas, fortunately, continues to bode favorably for everyone here especially given the limited expected supply growth, the very healthy convention and leisure demand, and the overall strength in the U.S. consumer.","We've had a clear vision for this company since I became the CEO. And with the execution of those strategies over the past many years, this vision has come to fruition. We are the premier owner operator of some of the best entertainment assets in the world. We have transformed this company from the inside-out to fully embrace a one company, one culture mindset to leverage our scale and the high standards for excellence and to continuously elevate our business.","We have developed the culture of continuous improvement that has allowed us to provide growth opportunities to the best talent we have in our company and to become the employer of choice in this industry for newly recruited talent, and we have developed talent from within. We have a very deep bench of highly experienced people that have been promoted and are driving innovation. And we constantly strive to optimize our company structure with these long-term sustainable benefits in mind.","We're very excited about the fact that our free cash flow prospects this year and beyond are so favorable. We're moving out of a development stage and into this operation stage, and we believe that will substantially increase our free cash flow.","We're going to maintain a strong balance sheet. We are disciplined in terms of capital allocation and returning value to our shareholders will continue to be the top of the board and the management's priorities. Every decision that we make is deliberate and centered around this vision. And we will continue to do so going forward as we build upon this organization and build upon our competitive advantages in Las Vegas, Macau, our regional markets, or anywhere else across the globe where we will call home.","And with that, operator, I'd like to turn it back over to you, so we can get to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question today comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead with your question.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey. Good morning, everyone. There are a lot of places where we could begin, but I wanted to start with Cotai. A question we get often is what's behind the delay. And is it systems? Is it construction? Are you reconfiguring it in one way, shape or form, particularly given how the VIP numbers have started to lift? Grant, if you could just give us some sense of where this is going, particularly on the marketing side, as you open?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Okay. Well, I think, everyone understands building anywhere in the world is complicated, and I think everyone have seen from all the other operators it's probably just as complicated in Macau. We're very, very committed to making sure we do something different. We need to be bringing something unique into the market, and that's really the crux that \u2013 the key aspect for us. And we've said it quarter-after-quarter, it's about getting it right.","Picking up on your point, Harry, about the VIP, yes, it's starting to move, that seems to be positive. There is an uptick with civil operators, and I think we've consistently heard that. I just want to reiterate though that in terms of our mass business, ours is continuing to be very strong, very important for us that we manage that portfolio. With only one operating business unit at the moment, that does put us into something of an advantage. But the critical point is that we are starting to build out the combined business unit strategy between Macau and Cotai. And we will be launching in the not too distant future, a very significant marketing program that starts reinforcing and building on that brand values that Jim was talking about in the presentation.","That's what's critical for us, is making sure we get the property right, get the messaging right, get all of the activities that we need to put in place. Specifically with VIP, I'm very comfortable now that we have got in the pipeline some additional VIP operators that will be new to us coming into our property in Macau. And so, that's all part of building out this whole MGM Macau presence, rather than just simply saying Cotai property or Macau property is really important to us.","Is that sort of the direction you're looking for, Harry? Is there anything else I can add?","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","That's very helpful. It's \u2013 there'll probably be some additional questions on that. But I wanted to move over to Dan. I had question on a new slide that you presented, page 24, when you discussed free cash flow. And, Dan, can you give us a sense of as we get deeper into this year, your perspective of how your domestic free cash flow is likely to evolve?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, sure, Harry. Look, what we tried to do at 24 is give the investment community, kind of the building blocks of that domestic profile and look of how all of the pieces are coming together to give you better perspective of that sources and uses more or less. So, that's what 24 really gives folks. It isolates the domestic group apart from MGP and MGM China. And I think as we continue to move throughout the year, as Jim mentioned earlier, and move beyond our development cycle here with the close-out of National Harbor, obviously, we'll be finishing this year and next year, Springfield, and getting that opened by September of next year, we'll be heavily out of that capital intensive development cycle and see our cash flow \u2013 free cash flow continuing to improve and grow as not only we grow operationally and maximize our profitability at our existing properties.","We bring on Borgata for the full year, continue to ramp-up National Harbor and the lowering of the development capital will just have a profound impact on growing our free cash flow profile starting this year and into next year.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","But can you \u2013 I guess, as a follow-up, can you discuss the timing or the pacing of how your CapEx actually winds down this year and next?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, sure. I mean, obviously, we've laid out what our capital plans are in terms of not only our maintenance and our same-store property growth capital, but our project plan. So, I think, we have about another $80 million-ish to close out National Harbor's construction cost. We'll spend about $240 million, $250 million this year in total for Springfield and a little less next year in completing that property. I think, it's around $230 million, $240 million for Springfield next year. But those are really the only two remaining large pieces of capital. And then, of course, from time to time, you're going to see kind of us pulling on the various levers and opportunities we have much like you saw here in April with our ability to bring $300 million back into this restricted group from CityCenter.","So, it's going to continue to build. It will be a little bit choppy because of some of those positive effects like CityCenter coming in from time to time and future dividends from Macau as Grant, Bill and our construction team bring that project to its completion later this year and ramp up next year. I would expect those dividends to pick up in 2018 and 2019 as well.","So, there's a lot more of positive inputs coming in over the next two years than just the incremental free cash flow on a same-store basis.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And Dan \u2013 maybe just to add to that, Harry, I think, you're just focused on CapEx. So, just if you looked out the last \u2013 next three years or four years, our CapEx is $400 million, $500 million a year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yes. I think, this year \u2013 for our properties, it's about $540 million this year which is inclusive of the Park MGM and NoMad...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Right.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","\u2013 construction which is probably a couple hundred million in that number, this year alone.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Right. But I means if you were going to model out over the next three \u2013 I mean, if you're doing like a three year or four year model, you're going to figure CapEx is no more than $500 million a year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Right. Yeah.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And we have no projects of any material nature like Springfield or National Harbor on the horizon.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Beyond 2018, that's right.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","So, we have \u2013 and in that $400 million, $500 million a year is all our room remodels, all the refreshes, expansions to convention centers. All the areas that we spend money on to continue to grow our market share and our market. So, that's what I was trying to allude to Harry is that we just had a major capital finish at National Harbor that's tailing out right now. We're going to finish Springfield, and there's no new project down the horizon in the United States and we like what we own.","And so, we believe with our operating revenues and cash flows growing and our CapEx to be completely controlled by ourselves and very definable, that's where you lead to \u2013 even before dividends, that's where you lead to rapidly accelerating operating free cash flow.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","That's great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Harry.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Hey, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Maybe this is a question for Corey, but whoever wants to answer it. Can you talk about how next year's convention room night on the Las Vegas Strip look? And if you want to talk about it in terms of pacing versus a year ago, and maybe you can talk about it both with and without the impact of this year's CON\/AGG CONEXPO?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Sure, Joe. It looks pretty big and similar to few years ago when CONEXPO rotated out. We actually are in a similar spot to where we are this year. We're a little bit behind in the first quarter, but we're really comfortable that we'll be able to fill that spot there for CONEXPO. But in general, the rest of the quarters are actually looking very comparable to where we are today.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the pricing for those room nights versus this year?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. Pricing \u2013 we continue to be able to raise prices in this segment, so it's up.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And, in fact, Joe, I mean, right now, we have NAB, of course, in town, right? Corey and Bill, Dan? It's performing extremely well for the market. Well, I could say it's performing extremely well for us and probably for the market. So, here we are in the second quarter. That's doing well.","I was with the CEO of a very, very large tech company yesterday, and he's looking to move more business to Las Vegas from another state in the United States. So, there's a lot of untapped potential for the market, which will benefit our competitors, ourselves, and the convention center at large.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. And then maybe this is a question for you, Jim, and, Grant, over in Asia. Obviously, we're not seeing it so much in the 1Q here but \u2013 and I asked this question last night on another gaming conference call. Are you starting to see any signs of the Chinese consumer returning to Las Vegas, and do you think what's going on maybe some of the dynamics in China and Macau are actually encouraging those players to stay closer to home in Macau? Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","You want to tackle that, Grant?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Sure. I'll start. I think, Joe, what we're seeing, let's start to talk about China itself. If you start looking at consumer trends in China, there is clearly momentum building in the consumer products market. If you look at some of the areas that the Chinese use as their own indicators, they're starting to improve. There's starting to be some momentum. We're clearly starting to see it coming into Macau, and that's all very positive for us.","And I think to your point about geopolitical issues, I think that hopefully that those people within China will play within China. But I think, if they're going to travel, and obviously that's probably something that Jim and Corey and Dan, et cetera, can have a view on, but they're also seeing the United States as a positive destination, too. So, all of the indicators at the moment within China are positive. And I see most of the issues that we see in the world being positive for Macau, certainly.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And, Joe, here in Las Vegas, as we pointed out, I think, it was last fall, we started to see players coming back into the market. The most recent data point is really around Chinese New Year. So we had a really good showing around Chinese New Year with our customers in terms of numbers and volume up this Chinese New Year versus last year. And as you recall, the last couple of Chinese New Year's periods, we're actually down and we were down double-digits against each of the prior years. So, we have seen that pick up recently with respect to play coming out of China and Asia, broadly speaking, which is a good sign.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","And I would say, Joe, on our bigger customers, the people like 50,000 and above, the number of trips are actually up in the first quarter for that region.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks. Good morning. Jim, I think you laid out pretty clearly the second quarter and some of the challenges there. I wanted to talk a little bit about what is actually the toughest comp quarter of the year, the 3Q? And maybe, Corey, if you could help better frame or help us better understand the influence of having that Microsoft business in the quarter? And in a period with a lot less visibility, what it's like to have 4% or 5% of your room nights, kind of on the books already with that. And what it may allow you to do with pricing?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Hey, Corey, do you want me to start?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","He's referring to Corey.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","He said Corey, but I'll start. You know, it's \u2013 when we were more concerned about the third quarter that was before we had the Microsoft business on the books. That clearly helps us profoundly in the quarter in terms of not only the business itself but, as you suggest, how we can plan around the rest of the market. We had a very, very strong third quarter, that's why it is a challenging quarter.","But we're seeing, and I was with Mike Dominguez yesterday with this very large tech CEO, and he's seeing some business coming into the third quarter, not only because Microsoft is going to be here, we're getting some ancillary business that's being booked, but also just general in the quarter, in the year, for the year for the quarter.","So, yeah, tough quarter, tough comp but we did better than we thought in the first quarter, as I said, that April here, NAB is better than we predicted, it's sort of good bellwether even though there's a tough comp this quarter, we are seeing good growth and we're just going to do our best.","We've been outperforming our expectations, and we're just going to do our best in terms of the convention side. One thing I alluded to, and maybe Corey can get in more specifically, is our mix shift, one of the things that helped us in the current quarter, right, Corey, is shift out of leisure into FIT?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","That's right.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","So, how that's going to look, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Over the last few quarters, we've been really focused on that. We actually shifted probably about 2% into that FIT channel. We haven't talked about this in a long time but, actually, the premium in that channel compared to the leisure channel, could be anywhere from $30 to $60 depending on the season of the year. So, with the convention base, it allows us to do it. When you look at Microsoft has done for us now in the third quarter, we're actually ahead of convention room nights on the books compared to the prior year now with that. So, it's allowed us to solidify our base. Our convention rate actually is a little higher now which should hopefully allow us to yield our rates up a little better than normal.","Just as a reminder, summer times are \u2013 there's peak times when there's decent convention business, and where there's not, it's a \u2013 we'll always fill the rooms but the rate's always a little bit of a challenge.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. And then if I could just one follow-up, Jim, you talked a little bit earlier about capital returns and, obviously, as you look at the free cash flow profile over the next 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, there is clearly going to be a lot of discretion with your cash going forward as you \u2013 especially once Cotai is open. How do we or how do you guys right now \u2013 if you look at it right now, 24 months out, how are you kind of thinking about the buyback? Obviously, dividend in place as of last quarter and other kind of capital returns, or capital needs for things that maybe haven't necessarily come to fruition yet in terms of projects or expansions?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. We spend probably, Dan what \u2013 I would say the majority of the discussions we have at the board level is that over the past several years, we've been good forecasters internally of our business. We've laid out a rolling five-year plan to our board over the past many years. And fortunately for us, we've been executing on that five-year plan. So the board is \u2013 this is not a new discussion to the board. We've discussed what we're going to do and how we evolve our investment decisions as we go from 2014 to 2015, 2015 to 2016, 2016 to 2017 and beyond.","And it is the board's belief that we have high confidence in where our numbers are going over the next three years. We see our competitive position in our marketplace. We think we have a better understanding than most of the macro dynamics within the markets in which we currently operate. We are very confident in our property positioning. We have no looming capital needs, no deferred maintenance, no projects that we put on hold that need to be jumpstarted. Our capital spend is very well defined, and will be very, very highly scrutinized by our board over the next several years.","We have no interest in building for growth's sake, and we have no interest in expanding for expansion's sake. We like what we own. We like the markets that we're in. And in order for us to get attracted to anything else it has to be outsized in terms of its potential return to shareholders.","So, with that in mind, if we know where we are in a market \u2013 in all our markets, and we know very clearly what we believe our capital expenditures will be, and we have this stated goal of being in the 3 to 4 times leverage range, which we're knocking on that door, then the logical discussion evolves to what you do with that excess free cash. And we concluded that the first best use of that was to institute the quarterly dividend and expect that that dividend will grow over time. But share repurchase clearly has been something we've discussed at the board level for three years. It is not a matter of if we are going to do that, it's a matter of when we do it.","And I would say that a board as engaged as ours, that spends as much time on this as our board does, that meets us often as we do a year, about eight times a year, we will have constant updates for you. As of right now, here in April, we believe that our path is well-understood and that we are using the cash that we have appropriately. And that share repurchase today, this day, is not the right idea.","But, we do believe that it is our job to return the capital that we are generating to our owners. And that's going to be making sure that we grow our revenues and cash flow. Making sure our competitive advantages are there. Making sure that we have a fortress balance sheet that will protect us against any unforeseen event. And making sure that we have the ability to return the capital in the form of dividends and share repurchase in the future.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That was very thorough. Thank you very much, Jim. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Carlos.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just on the regional properties, I was impressed by the flow through at both Detroit and Borgata. I'm wondering, are you starting to roll out programs there? Are you just starting to roll out programs there? And then on National Harbor, is there an opportunity on margins there?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","So, on Detroit, they've been rolling out programs consistently with our PGP initiatives. And there's still some opportunities there. They're probably a little bit behind. With the Borgata acquisition, we've matched up all our initiatives with what they could potentially achieve. And yes, we are seeing results from those in the first quarter. And we expect to see results from them throughout the year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","National Harbor.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","National Harbor \u2013 margins?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","On National Harbor margins, yeah, we think there's a lot of opportunities there to improve them, stabilize. The workforce is stabilized now which is a positive thing now. It's matching forecasts with volumes and implementing some PGP initiatives there that we probably delayed for their opening to make sure that they could execute for their opening.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful, thanks. And just as my follow-up. It was helpful, the new slide you put in showing the hold adjustments. But one thing that stood out was that you had five quarters in a row of high hold. Did you think about thinking of maybe increasing the theoretical hold?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, Thomas, this is Dan. We've looked at it and we studied it and obviously it'll be something we continually look at. We feel comfortable that 21% to 25% is the right range. And obviously, it'd be something we continue to evaluate.","A lot of the initiatives and a lot of the approach that we've taken over the past 18 months to 24 months with respect to how we drive profitability in our table games business is driving some of that increase, and we'll continue to monitor that, but based on the work that we've done thus far looking at the past couple of years, 21% to 25% seems to be the right range in terms of that hold percentage.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. If you went back five years, you would say, you shouldn't change the range.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yes. Yes.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","So, we get the point. We're going to watch it, quarter-to-quarter, but we did a lot of work on this and we've gone back over the last three years to five years, and that's a right amount of range. We might be able to tighten it up and, hopefully, move it up at some point.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. So, guys, so realizing that your 2017 EBITDA guidance provided at the Investor Day is old news, given everything that's happened since then. I was just hoping you could frame for us how you're thinking about full-year EBITDA now year-over-year? Should we expect to see growth year-over-year? I just think it would be helpful if you could give us a bridge as we think about that particularly given that the second quarter could be kind of flattish and then there was also the gain on sale on assets which makes for a tougher comp?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, sure, Felicia. I think, when you look at our full year, and the guidance and color we've given, we do believe that for the full year, we'll be able to grow low to mid-single digits on the top line and improve our margins by 50 basis points to 100 basis points. So, that would put us in kind of the 30% to 31% range overall in terms of our margins. That's adjusting for some of the ins and outs from the prior year as well as really kind of normalizing the hold overall as we look at our Strip performance and the guidance we've given for 2017.","Probably one of the bigger deltas from the Investor Day is really the timing of MGM Cotai as when we're putting those models together last year for the Investor Day, Cotai was still on target for an early 2017 opening. And, obviously, with the later opening, that pushed that timing out and that impact to the model. That's probably the biggest singular change.","As always, ins and outs and odds and ends. But we feel pretty good that here in Las Vegas, we'll be able to continue to grow and maximize the opportunity here, the regionals as well. And, obviously, you've seen the power of Detroit, Borgata and our ability to ramp with National Harbor coming online this year. So, we feel good about directionally where we're heading overall for 2017.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I think just to be clear because I might not have been clear, I was really more talking about second half because you gave the guidance in the deck, I saw that, but you guys \u2013 you had the upside in the first quarter, flattish in the second quarter. So, I just wanted to kind of confirm that you do actually see growth in the second half.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yes, we do.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","We do. Yeah. The biggest change from that deck is the shift of the opening of Cotai, Felicia. But operationally, we remain on track.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then you completed your PGP program ahead of plan. So, I was just wondering if you could talk about what drove the acceleration. And then as you think about the next several years, how should we think about profitability drivers with that program being completed?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, do you want me to do it, or Corey, you want to do it.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","You start and I'll...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I'll start. So, the way we were able to upsize it and get it done so quickly is to create top-down focus in this whole organization. It wasn't an initiative that was sidelined by a handful of people, it was pervasive throughout the entire organization. And there's no one here at this company that is not acutely aware of what we've been doing, now I'm talking tens of thousands of people. So, it takes a very coordinated effort, it also takes a very focused effort in the project management office, that has since its inception been led by Jeff Gebben, who is a rock star.","And \u2013 so, we went into this with good guidance from other companies that are Fortune 100 companies that really helped us a lot. We went in this with good guidance with Bain as our consultant. And we have really taken it on-board as a change of our lifestyle here. And it has led to not only what you saw financially, but it has led to a morale accelerator here and really a cultural boost. And so, we believe that this is a program that's now just part of our life.","As it relates to what it means for the future, we \u2013 as we said, we think we understand our business quite well and we're expecting 50 basis point to 100 basis point increase in our margins against a pretty good year in 2016. And we don't think we're going to end there. We expect and would be disappointed if we can't grow margins every year over the next three years or four years because we continuously find ways to do our business better. And so, I don't know where this journey is going to end, but it's not going to end this year and I expect continued leadership in our industry in terms of margin, in terms of the absolute margin, and the growth of the margin.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And what I would add is continuous improvement is now part of our culture, and it's actually part of our compensation plans and everything else. All of our executives are bonused on it. We have a list of initiatives we could constantly and continue to work on that have some pretty good size. And with the change in technology and the advancement in analytics and eventually AI, there's probably numerous opportunities out there to constantly find new ways to make additional EBITDA.","The great thing about the PMO office is it gives us the structure to sustain what we have already achieved, but also continue then look for new opportunities which some we could accelerate because they're easier, and some are a little bit harder, but there's still opportunities out there.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Dan, just a quickie, on the hold impact this quarter, how much did it benefit and were there specific properties that had higher holds that you want to call out?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Mirage held exceptionally well. Bellagio was a benefactor of that hold, and I would say MGM Grand was not a benefactor of hold in the quarter, if I was to look at the highs and lows in the quarter.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","That's right.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And the total net was?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I think we said in the appendix of the deck.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yes.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh. I understand.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","$16 million.","Unknown Speaker","But that is the normalized, the midpoint of the normal range.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Right.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","We held couple of basis points just higher than the high end of the range at 25.2.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. And that was about mid-teens, right? Mid-teens millions?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","EBITDA.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","In EBITDA.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Yeah. 16.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","16.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Unknown Speaker","And that's (47:32) numbers.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Okay. Thanks so much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Felicia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for all the additional disclosures. So, I was just maybe wondering with follow-up on National Harbor. I know, it's smaller, but when we think about opportunities in the second half of the year. I think, the game plan there eventually was still to look to partner with MGP for that property. And so, looking at the ramp right now, Jim, what do you think is the right timeline to kind of be considering the next steps for National Harbor?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. So, when we were on the road with the MGP road show, we \u2013 last year, we tackled this question. We said that it was our best guess at that time that the most appropriate time to discuss a transaction between MGM and MGP would have been after you have a couple quarters of operations. So, that both companies can properly underwrite what the right valuation would be. And I think that's exactly are the timetable that we're on today.","National Harbor has done everything and a bit more than we had hoped it to do when we built it last year. The trajectory is exactly what we would have hoped to see. The upside is very apparent to us in terms of its cash flow potential and the real estate value of the asset is unquestionably pristine. And so, I would expect that we would hold to that time table that we discussed on the road show and start having robust discussions this year as early as the third quarter.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for that. And then, I guess, the second area, it sort of goes along with the same idea is obviously through the Borgata transaction MGM actually increased its stake in MGP and we continue to hear from investors that liquidity at MGP is one of the bigger challenges for possibly people not actually owning more of that company. So, curious for MGM's appetite to possibly either proactively sell down there or continue to look for or do you expect to think that the opportunity there is really going to be to shrink MGM stake through third party growth on the MGP side.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. So, I think that as an MGP shareholder. I like the scarcity value, and I like my position, but we do believe that MGP would benefit from and would be definitely benefiting from more liquidity and that is absolutely a goal of MGP is to increase its public float and it will do so because James Stewart who I'm looking at and Andy are aggressive young men and they're out on the prowl and they will be acquiring assets, and I'm sure they will be acquiring assets that MGM Resorts has nothing to do with. And they will be raising equity to do that. I also believe that even in a transaction with MGM Resorts, it's something that MGM Resorts should look at and allow for us to return cash to our shareholders rather than take back OP units just as a matter of course.","And so, I think that between the ROFO assets, which we can always tailor in terms of our consideration, in terms of OP units or cash, and third-party transactions, the public float of MGP will go up pretty profoundly over the next several years without MGM Resorts having to or wanting to do a secondary just for secondary's sake. And so, I think that the objectives of the investors that would like to see more public floated MGP will be achieved through what I believe to be very substantial growth in that company and growth that will be done with the balance sheet rigor that Andy and James have promised.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I think it's really clear. Thank you very much.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Shaun.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, our last question for the day comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. One Vegas question and one for Macau. In Vegas, can you just remind us how the convention mix, the percent is tracking for 2017 overall versus 2016? And then your comments, you talked a little bit about pacing in 2018 like behind in Q1, but the rest of the quarters comparable. So, where would you expect 2018 overall, that mix to end up versus where you think 2017 will be? Thanks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","So, Robin, for 2017, we feel that \u2013 and remember, we're coming off a record year in 2016, that will be at least as good as we were in 2016. Our goal is to be a touch better than that. So, we finished up 2016 at 19% mix. Where our goal is to be 19%, kind of 19.5% kind of range for 2017 that we're on pace for right now.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And that would be our 2018 goal also.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So, in other words, the 2018 mix kind of similar to 2017 mix because of the CON\/AGG comps, is that fair?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Correct.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then for Macau, I'm just curious if there was any collection that you had reserved against that might have ended up helping EBITDA. We saw that at some of the other operators in Macau that some collections that had been reserved against already ended up, and then \u2013 so the gain kind of runs through and helps EBITDA. Just wondering if anything like that?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Yes, Robin. There was some, about $3 million, but that was \u2013 that's relatively small within the bigger scheme of things.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And maybe just a last question on Macau. With the concession set to expire in 2020, do you have a thought about when those discussions might begin with the government about the renewal process, or the revisiting process for that, is that something that you would expect to happen in 2018, or sooner?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Well, I think, the bottom line is as far as we're concerned, we are working on the renewal every day. And I think that's what's really important. And the most important component of the renewal process for us is getting Cotai opened successfully, demonstrating our commitment to the marketplace and continuing to develop all those things we're looking at.","From everything we are hearing, all the gaming concessionaires are obviously very focused on meeting the expectations of the government. But at the same time, I don't see that there is much of an incentive for the government to move too quickly on the other side of that agenda. But I think there is no indications that we've seen or heard, that suggests that there will be significant changes to existing conditions. However, we all need to work on it every day and we just need to commit ourselves to delivering on the expectations that have been set for us.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Good. And thank you, Robin. I'd add. It's Jim. Grant and I were together with senior officials only recently; we got very good feedback, not only about our Cotai project, which is really \u2013 I hope you had a chance to take a look at some of the run. It is really coming out beautifully. And it is going to open this year in the fourth quarter and probably right around \u2013 right after Golden Week, probably. But it's going to open this year for sure and it's going to be very spectacular.","And there's a high-degree of enthusiasm in China and in Macau for that opening, as well as the continuation of MGM's presence in the marketplace. So, we feel that's critical to us, particularly as MGM is spending increasing time in the region as we go from Macau over to Japan, where I seem to be about every month, Bill. And when I'm not there, you're there.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","(56:38).","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And, look \u2013 and maybe that's a good way to finish this. Japan, as we all know, is the largest potential opportunity that has been presented to gaming operators globally. It has the promise of being a spectacular market and all indications are that the government is moving deliberately toward the ultimate passage of the implementation act, which would lead us into an RFP period.","There is all kinds of game theory around this in terms of how this is going to play out, and some actually believe they have the \"pole\" position. But I could say a few things very confidently. One is that MGM is extremely active in the country, that our values, our track record of being great partners, whether it's at CityCenter, or National Harbor, or Macau, is well received. Our ability to design and deliver architecturally iconic, culturally relevant, and environmentally-friendly resorts has not been lost on everybody that we have talked to in Japan. And we believe that this is going to be the most competitive process that the gaming industry globally has ever undertaken, and that the only thing we can promise our shareholders is that we are going to outwork everybody. And we think we have as good a chance, if not a better chance, than anyone.","But make no mistake, when the questions were talked about throughout this call about capital allocation, this company is running this company to grow its cash flows to create that fortress balance sheet to maximize our free cash, and will not distract itself on other gaming opportunities, other growth opportunities that would derail what we believe to be the single greatest potential opportunity that we are fortunate enough now to have the balance sheet, the operating expertise, the scale, the development and operations people and the brands to be able to be a leader, at least a leader in that competitive bidding process. And that is we got our eye on that prize and we're not going to lose sight of that.","So, with that, I think, we've come to our end. We all \u2013 as always, appreciate the participation. And we'll all be here to answer any follow-up questions that you may have and please enjoy your day. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today's conference call.

Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bobby Baldwin, Chief Design and Construction Officer of MGM Resorts International and President and CEO of CityCenter; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings, Limited. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, thank you, Ashley, and good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and a replay of the call will be made available on our website. ","We furnished our press release on Form 8-K this morning to the SEC. And before we get started, I'd like to read a few Safe Harbors. On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause the actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. ","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website. ","Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Jim Murren.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Well, we had many accomplishments during the first quarter of this year. We completed several financing transactions at CityCenter and at MGM. MGM China paid a dividend of $400 million to its shareholders. We announced a partnership with Ameristar and launched the non-gaming component of M life, our rewards program. ","Here in Las Vegas, January and February were very strong months with increases in many of our core business levels throughout the properties year-over-year. Then we had March, where we faced 2 challenges, a very difficult citywide convention comparison and a poor table game hold. ","Despite these anomalies, growth in our Las Vegas resorts is continuing. We posted year-over-year growth across all major metrics. Net revenues, adjusted EBITDA, margins all grew year-over-year. We also cheated our REVPAR guidance of -- I think we said 2% to 3%. We're up 4% in our Las Vegas Strip properties. And we continue to believe that REVPAR growth for the year will be at least mid-single digit, with potential upside coming from the in-year-for-the-year convention bookings and retail segment strength. We grew both rate and occupancy, and our gaming volumes grew in table games and in slots. ","On the regional side, MGM Grand Detroit continues to perform well and had its second-best quarter ever. Detroit's performance was driven by record slot handle and revenue at that property. And in addition, both Beau Rivage and Tunica experienced significant year-over-year growth. CityCenter experienced a difficult first quarter from a hold perspective, with ARIA holding significantly below the prior year. I know ARIA is getting the high-end play and I know that they expect their customers to return the favor in future quarters. Bobby will discuss this in greater detail in a little while, and there are many great projects underway there to expand that business. ","MGM China reported another record quarter, with EBITDA growth of 21% and improved margins. Grant's going to go into further details about what's driving that and where we see continued growth opportunities. ","Beyond that, we're reinvesting in our resorts. As you know, we are actively pursuing growth opportunities in key gateway cities. We've recently been back from Japan, where we think the prospects are favorable, and more recently, in Toronto, which we find the opportunity there to be particularly exciting. We're spending time in South Korea and through MGM China in Taiwan, and of course, we remain highly focused on Western Massachusetts and we believe we're very well positioned on all these fronts. We continue to improve this company financially and operationally, and we're excited about our future. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to get into some of our operating results.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thanks, Jim. In the quarter, our wholly owned domestic resort casino trends continued to improve. Our casino revenues were up 9%, driven by table game volumes, up 5%; and our slot handle, up 7%. We saw year-over-year volume improvement in both our national and international rated table games play, and believe that this is being driven by market share gains and the continued rollout of our M life customer loyalty program. ","As Jim mentioned, unfortunately, our casino results were negatively impacted by hold in the quarter. Had we held at the midpoint of our range, we would have generated an additional $25 million in EBITDA at our wholly owned properties and approximately $7 million for our share at ARIA, assuming a midpoint of a hold range for ARIA. Given these adjustments, our property EBITDA -- adjusted property EBITDA would have been $509 million versus the $477 million we reported. ","Our room trends continue to improve. Our wholly owned domestic hotel revenues increased 3% year-over-year. That increase was despite having over 70,000 rooms out of service at the MGM Grand due to the current room remodel that's underway. And overall, we were still able to increase our occupied room nights by approximately 60,000 in the quarter, reflecting a gain in market share, as well as the continued strength in demand for our Las Vegas Strip resorts. ","It is clear that the underlying trends remained positive. But as anticipated, due to the difficult citywide convention comparison in March, our convention mix was down slightly year-over-year. Our luxury resorts were able to fill their convention room nights with in-house bookings and reported REVPAR up 7% in the quarter, while our non-luxury resorts reported a REVPAR increase of roughly 3% in the quarter. Those resorts obviously felt that impact of the citywide much more than our luxury resorts. ","As mentioned earlier, we've had a busy start to the year and have made several accomplishments in improving our balance sheet. In January, we completed a successful and well-subscribed bond offering, which was upsized from $500 million to $850 million. In March, we upsized another deal to $1 billion at 7.75%, due 2022. This issuance was the lowest bond yield issuance we've had since 2007. And we were also active in working with our lenders on the bank front. We amended and extended our senior credit facility to February 2015. And in March, we subsequently paid off the nonextended portion of our bank term loans. As a result of these transactions, our interest rate on our extended $1.8 billion credit facility was lowered in mid-April by 200 basis points to 5%. ","As a reminder, our average domestic borrowing cost is approximately 8%. So for every 1% improvement in rate, that equals approximately $125 million in annual interest rate savings. And as we go forward, we believe there'll be additional opportunities to further reduce our borrowing cost and improve our overall free cash flow levels. ","At the end of March, we had excess cash of roughly $800 million, which includes our share of the Macau dividend, which we received in the quarter, of $204 million. On a net debt basis, we finished the quarter just below $12 billion in debt, excluding MGM China. ","At CityCenter, we were also busy on that front, with Bobby and the team there. But we issued $240 million of first-lien notes, an attractive yield of 5.82%. We also repaid and replaced the remaining $75 million of term loans with a revolving facility, giving CityCenter greater financial flexibility going forward. And at the end of the quarter, that facility was undrawn. ","We will continue to look to be opportunistic in terms of extending our debt maturity profile and financing opportunities. And our focus now really shifts to MGM China, where we'll look to put a new financing package in place as we continue to finalize our Cotai development plans. ","During the quarter, we spent approximately $114 million, 1-1-4, including about $9 million at MGM China in CapEx. Our MGM Grand room remodel program continues to progress nicely with roughly 2,300 rooms completed, and that project is on budget and on time to be completed by September of this year. ","Going forward, to help with your modeling a little bit, we expect our stock compensation expense in the second quarter to be about $9 million or $10 million. Depreciation expense in the second quarter is estimated to be about $230 million to $235 million. Our interest expense in the first quarter, gross, was about $284 million, which included approximately $6 million for MGM China and $23 million in noncash amortization. ","We estimate that our gross interest expense for the second quarter will be down, our first quarter numbers about $275 million to $285 million, which includes about $6 million for MGM China, and again, $23 million in amortization costs. We anticipate that our effective tax rate during the second quarter will be approximately 3%. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Bobby to talk about CityCenter","Robert H. Baldwin","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2012, CityCenter resort operations generated adjusted property EBITDA, of $32 million, with ARIA reporting adjusted property EBITDA of $19 million. As mentioned, we were severely impacted by a low hold percentage. For the quarter, however, Vdara, Mandarin and Crystals all achieved record-level adjusted property EBITDA. ","When comparing year-over-year quarterly results for ARIA, hold affected adjusted property EBITDA by -- affected us by $26 million. As you know, we're in the gaming business and hold percentages can go both ways. This quarter, it went against us. In addition to the hold percentage impact, we also experienced a decline in table games volume and lower hold percentage in slots as well. There was also a property tax credit that benefited us in the quarter in 2011. Despite these factors, we continue to see a strengthening in the fundamentals of our business, as demonstrated by year-over-year growth in slot handle, REVPAR, occupied rooms, food and beverage revenue and retail sales. We continue to be pleased with the manner by which business volumes are increasing at ARIA. March occupancy at ARIA was the highest since the opening, coming in above 92%. Looking out for the next 2 quarters, room bookings are significantly outpacing last year. In fact, we expect occupancy in the second quarter to be the highest ever for ARIA, driven by continued growth in convention business, as our world-class convention space continues to gain traction in the marketplace. ","Convention business is also robust for 2013. ","It was announced this quarter that Viva ELVIS will be ending its run in August and we will be welcoming a new show, Cirque du Soleil production Zarkana, to ARIA in the fourth quarter of this year. Zarkana is a proven and established show that has been seen by more than 1.2 million guests in New York City, Madrid and Russia. We anticipate that Zarkana will provide a significant increase in show revenues, while also generating incremental traffic throughout the resort, and we're very excited for this new residency here at ARIA. ","Construction is also underway on Javier's, a Mexican restaurant that is extremely popular in Southern California. This well-known brand will be located off of the casino floor and will add energy and a unique experience to ARIA when it opens this August. ","At Vdara, as mentioned earlier, Vdara reported record adjusted property EBITDA of $5 million, up 69% from last year. Revenue increased 40% year-over-year, due in large part to an increase in occupied rooms. Additionally, we are pleased to have grown the ADR despite a significant increase in room inventory as compared to last year. Vdara continues to succeed in fulfilling a niche in the market as the premier non-gaming, non-smoking boutique hotel. ","Crystal's first quarter 2012 adjusted property EBITDA was $7.1 million, up 21 -- pardon me, 27% from 2011. The increase is the result of higher rents, new store openings and expenses stabilizing at lower levels. Three new tenants have opened in 2012 and currently, 86% of Crystals is under lease. ","Finally, 2 significant interior modification projects at Crystals were completed in April that promote more direct pedestrian access to ARIA from the Cosmopolitan bridge and the Gucci entrance off Crystals. Both properties appear to be successful -- or both projects appear to be successful at increasing the pedestrian flow through the ARIA casino and resort. ","And that concludes my report. I'll turn it over to Grant Bowie. Grant?","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Bobby. MGM China continues to perform well. For the first quarter, net revenues were $702 million. This was up 18% year-on-year, while adjusted property EBITDA reached $165 million, and this includes $12 million of branding fees. If we exclude the branding fees, adjusted property EBITDA was $177 million, and this is a 21% increase year-over-year. ","Our EBITDA margin before branding fee improved to 24.5% from 24.6% last year, due mainly to higher VIP hold percentage, continued improvement in main floor contribution and the impact of the efficiencies from the implementation of our key performance indicators. ","During the first quarter, we were able to drive growth from each of our revenue segments, with our market share remaining consistent at approximately 10%. And this is despite the addition of significant new capacity into the market. ","In our VIP business, volume grew by 6% year-on-year. We were able to add one new junket operator during the quarter and this contributed to our volumes, and we also benefited from a VIP hold of 3.2% for the quarter. ","On the main floor, table win was up 16% and our slots were up 20% year-on-year. The success of our main floor was the result of our continued effort to better-yield floor. Our slot growth has outperformed the market, and our March slot revenue was an all-time high for us. The slot performance, in particular, was driven by strong customer acceptance and increased use of the slots in our supreme and platinum gaming areas. We continue to seek out growth opportunities by driving improved operating performance; through continued volume and yield improvements; by innovation in our slot product; and programs designed to increase visitation to our property, as well as the expansion of our existing site. ","In terms of the volume growth, we are working to improve overall player and visitor numbers, and one tool we use to drive that is to increase and improve our Grand [indiscernible] events. We had great success with our winter skating arena and we've just opened a butterfly exhibit in April, which will be in the Grand [indiscernible] for the next 8 months. ","Our expansion project on our level 2 is underway and upon completion, we'll have 40 gaming tables, which are available from our existing table inventory of 427 units. We continue to put a lot of effort into our Cotai project to refine and enhance our design, and we believe the government approval for our loan grant application is imminent. We are well prepared to commence construction as soon as we are given the green light by the government. Our plans call for a truly unique MGM experience, which will have approximately 500 tables, 2,500 slots, 1,600 rooms, and we have a budget of approximately $2.5 billion to be spent over a timeframe of 36 months. ","At the end of the first quarter, MGM China had approximate cash of $575 million, debt of $552 million and adjusted leverage ratio of approximately 1 -- or 0.86, to be precise, based on a trailing 12-month EBITDA. ","In closing and in response to the often-asked question re: dividends, the board continues to monitor our financial position and will determine the future timing and amounts of -- based on the company's capacity to meet all of its obligation opportunities. ","And with that, I'd like to turn back to Jim Murren for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren","Thank you, Grant, and thank you for being up late at night. As we reflect on the first quarter, our takeaway is that the fundamentals of the business are getting stronger and the foundation for growth here in Las Vegas is broadening. We know this because we grew even in the face of the aberrations we discussed and we're growing now. That's good news for Las Vegas and good news for MGM. And looking forward, we're confident we can accomplish many milestones in the quarters ahead. We see great opportunities in international gaming, in our U.S. regional expansion, in online gaming and social media to come. ","The second quarter has some great events for the city. Floyd Mayweather is fighting this weekend at the MGM. And also next month, Pacquiao is fighting in June with -- against Bradley. And so these are major events, more than we had a year ago, and they drive casino play for the town, and largely for MGM. ","Over in Macau, Grant's enjoying Golden Week right now. I have to say it's off to a great start. Our forward-booking pace remains quite strong, as our convention base is solid and the retail segment booking trend's continuing to improve. Again, this supports our thesis of a broadening recovery in Las Vegas. We expect convention mix to increase year-over-year during the second quarter, and most notably, our convention pace is up significantly in 2013 and '14. ","Based on our current booking trends, we expect mid-single-digit REVPAR growth in the second quarter and as I said, we have a strong forecast for the year. We're driving future growth initiatives in fields where we believe we can yield high returns on investment. In the hospitality division, we've opened our first hotel in China, MGM Grand Sanya, and we are well positioned in key gateway cities around the world. We expect this hospitality business to grow, bear fruit for all of our shareholders. ","I'm very proud of our efforts with M life. We are seeing tangible benefits of capturing increased customer spend at our properties. We think this will continue and expand with the recent addition of our non-gaming amenities to our rewards program. We're very actively now cross-marketing our regional properties to drive market share and increase visits to Las Vegas, and we expect this trend will only improve with the marketing relationship we have created with Ameristar. ","New growth markets in gaming will likely emerge, and we have positioned ourselves internationally to effectively compete there. And we're very excited to say that this quarter, along with our partners -- in the second quarter, we're launching a social gaming site which recreates the Las Vegas Strip experience and exclusively features our brands. We believe that this product will be superior to what you currently see in the market and will be a strong customer acquisition and brand extension tool for us. ","And of course, we continued to remain aggressively focused on pursuing federal legislation for online poker and we're keenly aware of what's going on, on a state-by-state basis for those opportunities, which we think will likely emerge. ","So with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over to you so that we can get to the Q&A section of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Lerner with Union Gaming.","William J. Lerner - Union Gaming Group, LLC","A question and then a very quick follow-up. You -- Jim or Grant, I guess, you've been more measured over time in your Cotai approval commentary until now -- or until this morning. What makes you say approval's imminent? And then a quick follow-up.","James Joseph Murren","You want me to take that, Grant? And then you can follow up. We believe that the announcement of the land transfer to Wynn was -- is an important step and we believe that we will be following shortly thereafter. We believe our process through this since 2007 has been deliberate, measured and tracking to that type of outcome. And I would say that the opening of capacity in the marketplace, in a very measured approach the government has taken to growth and the very recent announcement with Wynn bodes very well for MGM. But Grant, you want to add to that?","Grant R. Bowie","I think I just want to add that, clearly, the Wynn announcement has now cleared the air. And from our perspective -- and most importantly, we've put a lot of time and effort into the process, both in our  dialogue with the government and understanding exactly their position. But most importantly, we're making sure we get the product that we know will add considerably to the diversification of the industry here in Macau.","William J. Lerner - Union Gaming Group, LLC","Okay. And then to follow up quickly, maybe for Dan or even Bill. In Vegas, when looking at all the data points out there, March seems to be an anomaly. Can you talk about why? Obviously, CONEXPO rolled off 100,000-plus delegates, but can you quantify it perhaps? Do April and May look as strong as January and February?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Bill, this is Dan, and maybe I'll ask Corey to jump in as well. But clearly, when you look at that one week year-over-year comparison, it had a dramatic impact on the operating leverage in the business, predominantly, in a lot of ways to our -- what we call our core properties, but our mid-tier and our value-orientated properties, so not just from an ADR standpoint. When there's 100,000-plus higher-spending individuals up and down the Strip, that obviously -- that tide rises all the ships on the Strip from a leverage standpoint. When we look at our January, February, and even 3 out of 4 weeks results in March, they were strong across the board, sans hold for a second in March, which the volumes all bode well. Corey, do you want to quantify?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes, just we did quantify it, Bill, because taking 120,000 attendees out for a week and replacing it with a lot less attendees absolutely had an impact on our business. And when we looked at it, it actually probably had close to a 3% increase in REVPAR for the entire quarter on the company, not just the month. And we would've had a very positive REVPAR growth in March if you just took that week out. From an EBITDA perspective, excluding any gaming win or loss, it probably was about a $15 million to $16 million impact on our bottom line just from that one week.","James Joseph Murren","I was just going to say, Bill, so while REVPAR was up 4%, you're saying that if that was not there, it would've been what?","Corey I. Sanders","It would've been a little over 7%.","James Joseph Murren","Over 7%. Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to get some clarification. When you talked about -- in an approval in Cotai, is that -- just looking at the Wynn process, in September there was the announcement that they had agreed to terms with the government and then the official gazetting took this additional sort of 6 months or so. So is the part that you think is imminent, is that agreeing to terms? Or has that already happened, but it's not necessarily something that you felt was -- needed to be in an 8-K? Or in other words, I'm just wondering which stage is the imminent one.","James Joseph Murren","You want me to take that, Grant, or do you want to do it?","Grant R. Bowie","Well, my comment is that the imminent announcement that we're waiting for will be the relation of the draft land concession and the processes that we're looking to do is obviously ensure that, that moves as quickly as we possibly can. And much of that has to do with the status of the -- our project in terms of its ability to be executed. So the process, as you understand, is that when you get the draft land concession, that process in terms of agreeing to those terms can actually be very -- quite quickly. And then we want to parallel that with moving forward with getting all the appropriate approvals to commence construction. But they're parallel, but need to be all completed, and then we hope that the land concession gazetting can be handled judiciously.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just switching over to Las Vegas. And I understand the impact in Q1 and you mentioned that '13 and '14 paces up significantly. It sounded like in your opening comments, you were kind of looking for in-the-year-for-the-year business to pick up, or that you're seeing that pick up. Can you tell us what, for the remaining 3 quarters, group nights on the books versus the prior year, how that's pacing?","James Joseph Murren","Corey's looking for that, Robin. I can tell you where we're seeing it segment-wise, because I was looking at this yesterday. We're seeing good strength in-the-year-for-the-year in the technology companies, health care. Automotive, as well, has been quite strong. And our lead numbers have been up really, and I know we had a great number in December. Do you have any of that, Corey, at your tips?","Corey I. Sanders","I don't.","Unknown Executive","On convention mix, we said that we expect convention mix to be flat to slightly up year-on-year this year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, the rooms are really close, the pacing's pretty close to prior year's pace.","Robert H. Baldwin","And we're up -- at CityCenter, we're up. 250,000 room nights versus 188,000, so it's about 70,000 room nights increase at CityCenter compared to last year.","Corey I. Sanders","We'll get you more, Robin, we just don't have it...","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just hoping you guys could provide a little bit more granularity. When we look at the segments in Las Vegas and try and get our hands around all the moving parts -- obviously, hold with an influence, with the convention calendar having an influence as well. But if you would look at kind of your core gaming segments as well as your core room segments, thinking about it from a margin perspective and flow-through to margins, with obviously gaming and other revenue seemingly leading hotel room revenue, I can understand why the margin is depressed. But could you talk a little bit more about maybe some of the limited flow-through that we did see in the quarter?","James Joseph Murren","Yes, I'll turn that over to Corey for that.","Corey I. Sanders","Yes, great. We've been watching this also. In the first 2 months of the year, when we had the right mix in there and the mix was supported by the convention base, our flow-through was in excess of 50%. The March impact was mainly the shift in CONEXPO leaving, and you have a lot more occupied core rooms at a lower rate. So we have -- we were actually up 60,000 rooms. We had 77,000 rooms out at MGM and we replaced those with the core rooms. So you're seeing an impact on your room rate because of that core shifting to the core for the rooms and we think that's an anomaly that happened just in that one event.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cameron McKnight with Wells Fargo.","Cameron Philip Sean McKnight - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question for -- a question for Jim or perhaps Grant, how are you thinking about financing on Cotai?","James Joseph Murren","Well, let's turn it over to Dan.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","I'll jump in real quick. I think when you look at it, obviously, the facility we did a couple of years ago was state-of-the-art at the time and is now probably -- we're probably paying too much and it's way underutilized. We'll look to probably do a $2 billion to $2.5 billion financing package at the MGM China level, and that free cash flow will be more than sufficient to do everything we want to do at MGM China from a development standpoint, as well as continue to look at future dividend opportunities.","James Joseph Murren","And I think we would add that we're at a position now in terms of our design development, we've chosen all of our architects. We have board approval at MGM China in terms of the  programming and design of what we're doing. We've been costing this building out more precisely. That, combined with our favorable outlook from a land perspective, means that we are gearing up that financing process right now and look to do that certainly by the end of the year. Right, Dan?","Cameron Philip Sean McKnight - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And Jim or Corey, how was the -- how's the convention and event calendar looking for the balance of the year on a year-over-year basis?","James Joseph Murren","Well, we have no more aberrations. We have no more of these things we have to talk about. And their calendar looks solid.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Convention calendar looks solid. And we've -- as Jim mentioned, we obviously have a good fight calendar this quarter. And the back half for the concert calendar and events calendar is picking up nicely in 2012 versus last year.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, and the convention mix is going to be up in this quarter. It will be up about 1 -- at least 1%.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And I think the event calendar is really back-loaded, and especially at the Grand with some great events. Madonna's in October. When you look at our first quarter numbers, the fact that the garden was not as busy as it was the year before and we have those increases in gaming numbers, I think that -- it shows the market is recovering even on the casino side here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, on your commentary about mid-single-digit REVPAR growth in Las Vegas in the second quarter and the back part of the year, how much of that is driven by price? How much of that is driven by your anticipated occupancy increase, because I'm presuming it's a mixture of both. And so if it is driven by some occupancies, are you -- and given the volume increases on the tables and slot handle, are you having to add much to FTEs in Las Vegas?","James Joseph Murren","So it's a combination of both, Joe, and we think that those trends are going to be growing in the year, but it's a combination of both, slightly more occupancy. You could see we're already at fairly higher occupancies, but improved mix and pricing at the different price points. And we are not anticipating adding any FTEs, to any material nature at all, for the entire year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, for having 66,000 more occupied rooms, we were actually up 0.4% FTE. So it's -- for the most part, it's flat.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then looking back at the quarter and the adverse hold, was that primarily at the Grand and MIRAGE, just eyeballing the year-over-year EBITDA results?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","That was predominantly, Joe, at Bellagio, Mirage and Mandalay. The Grand held, I'd say, within a normal range, but it's predominately at those 3 out of 4 properties, excluding ARIA, of course, if you have those numbers [ph] .","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So then looking at the wholly owned Las Vegas EBITDA result adjusting for hold, what has been the EBITDA margin on an adjusted basis?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","I've got to take a look at that. I think it would've been up about 40 or 50 basis points, I think, on a comparable basis.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about CityCenter. Bobby, I think in your comments, you had given a little bit of indication, something about a property tax benefit in the first quarter last year. But I was just trying to understand, because even when we hold-adjust the numbers, I felt like the margins were a little bit lower than what we were expecting. So I kind of wanted to get your sense for how we should -- kind of what do you think is the right stabilized margin there, kind of with normal hold, because I think in the second quarter, you have a tough hold comp, too.","Robert H. Baldwin","Well, the property tax benefit was about $4 million. That's the first part of it, and the remaining question had to do with the margin going forward?","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just kind of -- like, I mean, now that you've been -- the property's been up and running for a while, just kind of what are you thinking about the kind of the run rate margins there? I mean, directionally, should this be in-line with kind of what you've been able to do at Bellagio? Or is that too high? Or kind of with the mix of high-end, how should we think about normalized margins there?","Robert H. Baldwin","Well, it should be, going forward, 25 -- around the 25 percentile. And of course, I think you can expect the margin to be about 25%. Of course, we want to grow the volumes.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then the last thing was -- I think you mentioned that you did have a lower table volume in the quarter, too. Did I catch that right?","Robert H. Baldwin","Yes, it was about 7.5%.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But was that primarily on the, like just on the high-end side? Or was there something else going on, on the mass?","Robert H. Baldwin","80% of that was Baccarat, so some of it was timing.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, and also, this year, we had the big Chinese New Year's party at Bellagio. Last year, we had it at ARIA. So it's a -- just a shift year-over-year of where we hosted our major event. It had a lot to do with it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Strawn with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Strawn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One quick question on just the REVPAR trajectory as you go from 1Q to 2Q. If we're looking at kind of a plus 7% adjusted number for the first quarter, adjusted for that big show rotating out, I think you said at least mid-single digits. Does that mean you're confident that you could come in ahead of that if -- in quarter bookings, or stronger than expected, given that there don't seem to be any major calendar anomalies going forward?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","I think, Mark, that's the intent. Obviously, a lot is reliant on the in-the-year-for-the-year on the convention going forward, as well as continuing to gain traction on our retail pricing. And that is our goal, obviously, to continue to maximize that composition.","Mark Strawn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And are you seeing any -- at maybe some of your higher-end properties, seeing any pushback on rate as you try to push rate there, maybe like we saw in some of the other releases so far this quarter?","James Joseph Murren","We have not really.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dan, just to go back to something in your prepared remarks and also in the press release, where you talked about table volumes being up. I was just wondering if you could parse out for us how the mass did versus how Baccarat did.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, roughly -- how that works out, roughly about -- here on the Strip, about 7% increase in table game drop and about a 3% increase in Baccarat [ph] for our wholly owned Strip properties.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. And then, Grant, can you help adjust your results for the hold for us? And also, there's been a lot of debate lately about what theoretical hold should be in Macau, and definitely, I don't want to have that conversation now. But when you do that adjustment, are you using the 3% or the 2.85%?","Grant R. Bowie","I think what we're seeing, that the market is starting to stabilize closer towards that 3%. And I think it has to do now that the volumes have grown to a sort of a fairly strong mass, and recognizing that most of the operational commission programs are now on revenue share. Then I think that what we're now seeing that, that normalized percentage is probably slightly drifting up, but I'm not going to be unequivocal because I'll make -- I'll repeat the comment that Bobby made, that we're in the gaming business and the hold percentages do move around. But that's what we're starting to see as an emerging pattern for us, anyway.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So -- I mean, would you prefer when we adjust it to use -- for us to use the 3%?","Grant R. Bowie","Until we have a really bad month, then I'll come back and I'll tell  you another one. But we're fairly conservative and we're cautious, and we have tended to err to the lower side of that -- to the ranges. But we're now starting to see a pattern where it's certainly stabilizing closer to that 3%, but I don't want to make that [indiscernible]absolute, but that's where we're seeing our trend.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. As always, I appreciate the intellectual honesty. And then you added a junket, a new junket. Do you have any plans to add further junkets?","Grant R. Bowie","Yes, we've actually -- we'd like to keep a continual pipeline of opportunities, and that's where that's happening. And some of the work that we're doing around the property is reconfiguring existing spaces, repositioning tables to get them into better configurations. And we'd like to think that we might be able to accommodate one or maybe 2 going forward -- additional, going forward in the next 2 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a quick question related to Vegas. If you go back to 2006, 2007 and the volume or number of your room nights, how close are you now to that peak? And where I'm going with this question is, I'm wanting to get a sense of at what level you feel more confident in lifting your ADR as you get closer to that volume of room nights.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, we're looking at this right now, Harry. You want to look at -- we have all the convention room nights that far back. Are you talking about total room nights or just convention room nights?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","The convention room nights, because that's what seems to be what's driving the train here.","James Joseph Murren","So just to give you a basis, for 2007, we're about 1.8 million convention room nights at our company. And in 2011, we went to 1.6 million.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So would that imply that you really are that close to the line in the sand where you can get more aggressive? Or is there something else going on that keeps you a little bit more cautious about driving rate higher?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Obviously, Harry, there's a lot more room inventory on the Strip in comparing those periods. The other part of it is the citywide phenomenon. I mean, we've done a good job of driving market share increases and driving our convention mix back up. But as you saw in March, we've got to get that lift in the citywides again that we once had back then, in order to continue to drive the pace of the room side. So that's going to be -- and when you look at the improvements there, we're doing a good job on the citywides, but it troughed at about 4.3 million convention attendees. Last year, it was at 4.8 million. It peaked at 6.3 million attendees in the convention side on citywide. So we've got more work to do in terms of citywide, and that's going to help us to continue to drive rate going forward.","James Joseph Murren","Harry, do you want the 2012 estimate, since we have it?","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Sure, and through '16 would be wonderful.","James Joseph Murren","The 2012 forecast for the entire company, including ARIA, we expect to exceed 2007 convention room nights.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just a little confused. In the beginning of your commentary, you talked about that maybe some of your luxury hotels were doing a little bit weaker than some of the -- or a little bit stronger. I frankly forgot which way they were going, but you made a distinction between sort of luxury and the rest of the market. And then there's obviously been an issue with conference convention. Maybe I've missed something, but aren't those linked? Don't a lot of convention-goers stay at MGM, Mandalay Bay and Bellagio? And aren't those sort of the luxury or -- maybe I missed -- heard it wrong.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, I think you're flipped a little there. When you look at the first quarter and the impact that we saw, obviously, the Bellagios, MGMs, Mandalays and Mirage can backfill a large citywide event, and they did that in the first quarter. They were actually up much stronger in terms of REVPAR, about 7%, versus the mid-tier and value properties who were at about a 3% increase. So that was the distinction we made in looking at that -- those 2 parts of the market.","James Joseph Murren","And the luxury-convention mix for the first quarter was almost 29%, which is almost at peak levels.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just on this hold issue. Obviously, a bunch of people are asking it. Was there any change in the way the customers were playing? Were they moving around more frequently? Were they moving to competitive properties? Is that one of the reasons why the hold didn't normalize?","Robert H. Baldwin","No, at ARIA, we have the same length of play that we would expect normally and that we enjoyed last year. So it's mostly the swing of Lady Luck.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And it was across a few different table game types. So it's not like it was all Baccarat. I think during the quarter, we even -- perhaps in 21 nipped us as well. So...","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Forst with KeyBanc.","Dennis I. Forst - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to get a clarification on the convention room night projections, but then I had a question for Grant, if that's okay. The convention room nights in '07, I think Corey said $1.8 million. Was that for all properties? Did that include Treasure Island back then?","James Joseph Murren","Treasure Island. That -- was Treasure Island in '07? It would've been de minimis.","Corey I. Sanders","It would've been de minimis.","Dennis I. Forst - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the 2011 1.6 million room nights, did that include ARIA? Did that include all your owned and joint venture properties?","James Joseph Murren","The 2011 number? That did not include ARIA.","Dennis I. Forst - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It did not. So the one -- the record level in 2012 is not apples-to-apples with the 1.6 million in 2011, correct?","James Joseph Murren","Yes, that's correct.","Dennis I. Forst - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","But if you included ARIA, what would that number have been?","James Joseph Murren","It would've been close to 12.","Dennis I. Forst - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So between '11 and '12, it looks like it's going to be a similar number of convention room nights for the whole company?","James Joseph Murren","Correct.","Dennis I. Forst - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then for Grant, if you're still awake, I wanted to ask about traffic at your property, maybe the Peninsula area in general, since the opening of Sands Cotai Central. Have you noticed any change in the amount of both major players, room guests and just walk-in traffic?","Grant R. Bowie","Not really. And this is now, what, our third opening? Third property opening in Cotai since we've been on. And really, the impact seems to be getting smaller each time. If there's any impact within the short run that we've looked at, it's around the 3% to 5% in traffic, but it's not necessarily showing up in play. But that's also being affected by the fact that the -- that we've just come out of that pre-Golden Week cycle. That's a little bit difficult to really put a handle on it. We have obviously studied  the traffic and the spend, and I think we just need a little more time. I think we need sort of that 30 to 45 days is what we're now starting to see as the indicators. But by and large, things for us are very stable. And I think it's worthy of pointing out that for the quarter, the Peninsula is still generating 60% of all of the revenues in the city. And so the Peninsula is still really strong, and most importantly, it yields strong as well, and that's probably one of the key points.","Corey I. Sanders","2007 does not include Treasure Island.","James Joseph Murren","And I think, apples-to-apples to get to that point, Dennis, is that yes, it'd be flattish, but our convention mix will be up this year versus last because we have fewer rooms in service because of the room remodel at the Grand.","Operator","And there are no further questions in the queue at this time.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining. We're around for any follow-up questions throughout the course of the day.","James Joseph Murren","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14726":["MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February 20, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Daniel J.

Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bobby Baldwin, Chief Design and Construction Officer of MGM Resorts International and President and CEO of CityCenter; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings Limited. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, thank you, Mackenzie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This call is being webcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and a complete replay of the call will be made available on our company website. This morning, we furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC as well.","And before turning it over to Jim and get started, I'd just like to read our Safe Harbor disclosure. On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities law. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. And you can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is also available on our website. Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded. And with that, I'd now turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to report that in 2012, MGM Resorts' revenue grew by 17% and EBITDA grew by 13%. We closed a very productive year with solid fourth quarter results. And you can recall that for the fourth quarter, we had guided to flat to slightly up REVPAR, and we came in at 1% growth. Our net revenues were essentially flat, but we were able to increase our margins by over 100 basis points to drive EBITDA up 5% year-over-year despite lower year-to-year hold.","Today, MGM China announced a special dividend of $500 million. Recall that MGM Resorts International, as a 51% owner, will receive approximately $255 million from this dividend. I expect MGM China will be able to continue to pay distributions to shareholders while investing in its second property in Cotai. In fact, we have a board meeting next week where we will discuss putting in place a formal dividend policy.","2012 was a landmark year for MGM Resorts, and I'd like to pause a moment to identify a few of the highlights. We transformed our balance sheet in the quarter. I'm extremely proud of Dan and the team for the major refinancing transactions that you're aware of that we completed in December. They resulted in significant interest savings and that will obviously translate into incremental free cash flow and further help the company deleverage itself, which is our overarching goal.","We improved our properties. The fully remodeled rooms at MGM Grand and at the Bellagio Spa Tower are already obviously paying dividends. We launched several new entertainment and dining options, and they're generating nice returns, and we're going continue to do that in 2013. And that product delivery and improvement has allowed us last year and we believe will continue to allow us to gain market share and wallet share on the Strip going forth.","CityCenter is now obviously a rising star. Bobby will get into the details, but we made some tweaks to the property which are showing signs of real success in driving revenues across all business segments. And with an improving real estate market here in Las Vegas, we sold 427 condos at Veer in December for $119 million. That represented one of the largest residential real estate transactions in the city last year, and it cleaned up all the inventory at Veer with the exception of a few penthouses.","And of course, MGM China is a star and had another record year for results. Grant and his team are doing a tremendous job there. We continue to grow our business. We maintained our market share despite new additions to the market, and we improved our operating efficiencies. Back home, I made a few strategic changes to the management of our company to better, I believe, align our growth and initiatives and really improve how we use our resources as a company to work together. In addition to his job as Chief Marketing Officer, Bill Hornbuckle, was promoted to the title of President. And with this added role, he took on the management of our gaming and hospitality development businesses. Bobby Baldwin became the CEO in addition to his other titles at CityCenter, is running Aria for us, and there's no better executive to do that in our company. Corey Sanders took on more responsibilities and the team here, I believe, is streamlined, focused, dedicated, and it's been one of my goals to improve the company's culture to improve employee morale, which I believe we've accomplished, and ultimately, we're seeing that result in higher customer service and satisfaction. And of course, with all that we accomplished in 2012,  I think '13 will be a better year. I consider the '13 to be the beginning of the new era for our company, with the refinancing and the strong fourth quarter results being the concluding chapter to a company that was recovering through the recession, now we're a company growing through a growing economy.","Our properties continue to stun. We just, I think just yesterday, received over Four & Five Diamond Awards for this year. Our properties represent 20% of the entire AAA index. 15 of our resorts have received the prestigious Green Key rating for environmental conservation. That's up from '12 a year ago. And just last week, MGM was recognized by PR News as having the finest corporate social responsibility program in the country among large employers. We're especially proud of this as we had some pretty heady competition from companies like Coke and Pepsi and UPS.","Just last month, in Cotai, our land was gazetted, and we've recently received our general building permit, and we are moving quickly to start construction on what will soon to be what we believe will be the most exciting resort in all of Cotai. And we remain on track, as we said before, for an early to mid-2016 opening, and there's an awful lot of work on-site right now.","In the quarter last quarter, a referendum was passed in Prince George's County in Maryland, and we are now in the RFP process for what would be a very lucrative fixed license in Maryland. We have a deadline, as do others, of May to submit our proposal. We will easily meet that deadline, and we believe that we will prevail for an MGM at National Harbor, which is a tremendous destination resort, literally minutes from our nation's capital. A decision on that by the State of Maryland will be before the end of the year, we expect.","We also recently submitted our RFP for Springfield, Massachusetts. And last week, the mayor of Springfield made a decision to negotiate a host city agreement with both MGM and another operator in that market. We are confident that our proposal delivers the best benefits to the city and has the best chance of prevailing for the Western Massachusetts license and we'll see.","And in Toronto, we recently announced a partnership with Cadillac Fairview. Cadillac Fairview is the premier real estate developer in Canada and has developed some of the most iconic retail and mixed-use developments in Toronto and really across Canada. They are a subsidiary of Ontario Teachers' Pension Fund, and we are very proud to have them as our partner as we jointly pursue the exciting opportunity in Ontario.","So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about how we did in terms of operating results and our financial position today.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thank you, Jim, and good morning again, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we had a solid fourth quarter, which was led by a good October, a somewhat soft November and a strong finish in December, driven by Western New Year's. I'll go through a few highlights from our fourth quarter results.","Our wholly-owned EBITDA increased by 5%, driven by a 6% increase in cash flows on the Las Vegas Strip. We were able to grow our EBITDA and our margins during the fourth quarter despite a holding over 100 basis points lower year-over-year. Our International casino business continues to be strong as this was a record fourth quarter for our strip properties when you include Aria for both the international drop and win. And we are seeing some encouraging signs in our domestic casino play as our non-Baccarat table drop at our wholly-owned strip properties increased 6% year-over-year.","Slot revenues grew 4% at our Las Vegas Strip properties, a testament to our M life best efforts, and as Jim mentioned, the various rollouts of different venues and entertainment options for our guests. In our hotel segment, room revenues were up 2%, led by a modest increase in rate, as well as an increase in occupied room nights during the quarter. The increase in occupied room nights is largely a result of the completion of the MGM Grand room remodel in September. As you recall, we had roughly about 70,000 rooms out at the Grand for the first 3 quarters last year. Our convention mix during the fourth quarter, overall, was essentially flat year-over-year at approximately 15%, which is solid given the increase in our available rooms.","Looking at the room trends here in the first quarter. We anticipate the trends to be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter, with room revenues up low-single digits and essentially flat REVPAR. Our regional properties are continuing to do well despite a difficult, competitive and operating environment. Both MGM Grand Detroit and Beau Rivage increased their EBITDA year-over-year. In fact, MGM Grand Detroit achieved a record fourth quarter EBITDA.","With these best-in-class assets and the power of M life, we were able to maintain a premium market share in each of those markets. Moving over to the balance sheet and some help with your models going forward, as Jim mentioned, in December, we completed a comprehensive refinancing transaction, which will save our company roughly $230 million per year in annual cash interest expense. Consistent with our strategy, these transactions will allow us to maximize our free cash flow and further enhance the company's deleveraging efforts. We currently have approximately $1.2 billion in available capacity under our corporate revolver and approximately $220 million in excess cash on the balance sheet, totaling just over $1.4 billion in available liquidity, excluding MGM China.","We will continue to evaluate opportunities to derisk the company and improve our overall cost of capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, MGM China had cash of approximately $952 million, debt of approximately $554 million and adjusted leverage ratio of less than 1 based on their trailing 12-month EBITDA. Pretty strong balance sheet and clearly led to the board's decision to make the announcement on the special dividend today.","CityCenter is on solid financial foundation with approximately $1.85 billion in outstanding debt, excess cash of approximately $210 million. And in addition to that, CityCenter is also sitting on about $140 million in cash related to condo proceeds, led by the late December sale of the Veer units. Our fourth quarter CapEx was approximately $83 million on our wholly-owned domestic resorts, and MGM China spent about $23 million. Full year CapEx for 2012 was approximately $343 million, just inside of our guidance of about $350 million for the year. And MGM China CapEx for 2012 was about $80 million, which included approximately $36 million for design and development fees related to our Cotai project.","Looking forward into 2013, we expect our CapEx to be similar to 2012 at about $350 million, excluding MGM China. And MGM China will spend about $75 million at MGM Macau, and about another $175 million on our development efforts in Cotai, excluding land and cap interest. Our corporate expense in the quarter was higher, driven primarily by $34 million in costs associated with the referendum in Maryland, as well as our other development efforts in Massachusetts and Toronto.","Going forward, we expect corporate expense to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million per quarter. Stock compensation expense in the first quarter is estimated to be approximately $9 million. Depreciation is estimated to be relatively consistent with the fourth quarter. Our interest expense in the fourth quarter was approximately $280 million, including about $8 million from MGM China and $17 million in amortization expense.","We estimate that our gross interest expense in the first quarter will be approximately $225 million, including $8 million from MGM China and about $8 million in amortization expense. With that, I'll turn it over to Bobby to talk about CityCenter.","Robert H. Baldwin","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report that CityCenter posted EBITDA of $68 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, a 17% year-over-year increase. For the full year 2012, CityCenter EBITDA for -- from resort operations was $230 million. ARIA achieved EBITDA of $54 million in the fourth quarter, a 15% increase year-over-year despite a 330-basis-point decrease in table games hold percentage. We are beginning to see results from the changes we've made at our -- and continue to make, notably our new Cirque du Soleil show, Zarkana, opened on November 1, and is off to a great start as show occupancy through the end of the year was 88%. ARIA showroom revenues grew 38% year-over-year during the fourth quarter. Zarkana's success has helped drive restaurant covers and other incremental spend at ARIA.","We are happy with the growth in volumes we are seeing in both slot and table games revenues. Slot handle increased 11%, making fourth quarter of 2012 our highest slot handle quarter yet. On the table games side, drop increased 5% to the highest level since Q4 in 2010 with particularly strong volume coming from our international customers. Hotel revenues grew 3% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Occupancy was up 370 basis points to 86% with REVPAR up 2%. This was our first full quarter with Javier's Mexican restaurant on property, and it continues to do well. In addition, the remodeled buffet opened December 21. So far the new look and cuisine offerings have been well received and customers have provided very positive feedback. We will be opening a new concept -- a pizza concept by chef Shawn McClain at our recent sports book mid-summer this year.","While it is still early, ARIA is off to a good start in 2013, and we expect to continue to build traction throughout the year. Convention sales are pacing well as room nights on the books for 2013, as of February 1 are 14% ahead of last year at this time. Construction continues to progress on the new marquee, which will be the tallest on the Las Vegas Strip with -- when completed in the second quarter of this year. It is over halfway up and already has a commanding presence on the Las Vegas Strip. We're excited about this project and look forward to utilizing the striking marquee to better advertise and showcase the wonderful venues that ARIA and CityCenter has to offer.","Vdara continued to grow occupancy, which is now in the low 80%, with all of its room online -- all the rooms online driving hotel revenues up 6% year-over-year. Crystal finished the year very strong with EBITDA of $9 million in the fourth quarter, which is the highest ever and a 34% increase over 2011. These results were driven by growth in the number of tenants and sales volumes. Construction is underway for the 2 new Starbucks located at the Mandarin Oriental and the Crystals pod location in Crystals. They are expected to open in March and April of this year.","And that concludes my report, and I'll turn it over to Grant Bowie. Grant?","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Bobby, and good morning to everybody, particularly the early morning for those of us in Asia. Another good result from MGM China. And for the fourth quarter, MGM China net revenues were $731 million, that's up 2% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $176 million, a slight increase over the year despite lower hold. For the full year, net revenues at MGM China were up 8% to $2.8 billion. And adjusted EBITDA was $679 million, that's an increase of 10% before branding fees.","Our overall VIP win for the quarter was approximately 2.9% and a decrease from the prior year which was approximately 3.2%. VIP table games turnover increased by 6% year-over-year. We're seeing early signs of success from our Level 2 VIP gaming floor expansion, which opened in late September. We're also expecting to add another junket operator in the second quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter was our strongest volume quarter for the year for our own in-house VIP business. We expect to see continued growth in this business with the support from the MGM International marketing team.","And main floor table game business has had its best quarter today with volumes up 13%. For the full year, our main floor table games volume grew 24%. Our slot handle increased by 37% during the third quarter and was up 35% for the year, outperforming the market growth of 16%. Our main floor table games and slot business now accounts for approximately 60% of our EBITDA, and that's up from 50% in 2011. This transition of mix has also driven an increase in our pre-branding fee EBITDA margins by 60 basis points. We expect this positive trend of increasing main floor mix to continue, driven by upgrades to our main gaming floor product, marketing efforts and, of course, the strong growth in the Macau mass market revenues.","We've made great progress with regard to our second resort to be built in Cotai, as Jim mentioned. Our land was gazetted on January 9. We've also received the approval for our general building plan. And our next step will be to host an official groundbreaking, which I'm pleased to announce will be scheduled for February 27.","As a recap, our Cotai project will have 1,600, 2,500 slots and up to 500 tables. General contract tenders for the project are now in, and we've updated plans to include additional foundation work that will allow for future expansion. With these upstates, the construction budget is expected to be approximately $2.6 billion, excluding land and capitalized interest. Spending will be over a time frame of 30 to 36 months. And as previously indicated, we -- our project -- projected opening date is early to mid-2016. The project will feature over 85% of our floor area allocated to nongaming amenities, including a broad range of restaurants, retail and entertainment offerings.","And with that, I'd like to turn back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Grant. Well, we are off to a very solid start here in 2013. We've already had several major events during the first quarter, which have set a positive tone. The Super Bowl was a great event for us, with strong table games drop. And as I think you saw, the state had record sports book right. And although we're still collecting our data both here in Las Vegas for Chinese New Year's, we are because many of our customers are happily still here, the Year of the Snake looks to be a very good one for us.","Bellagio, here we debuted a private gaming salon on our villa level, which drew some very important, high-end international customers for the holiday. And we also, here at Bellagio, hosted the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, our partners in China, for a series of extraordinary dinners with senior elected officials from both China and the United States, as well as some of the most important customers that we know.","We have great volumes throughout the company, throughout this period of time, both -- at all of our major luxury resorts. And we believe that the International business is off to a tremendous start for 2013. We have some great new restaurant, nightclub, entertainment offerings coming online this year. Just in the second quarter alone, we have a new showroom at Mandalay Bay for the Michael Jackson Cirque show. And our friends at Hakkasan are spending a tremendous amount of money to build the most elaborate, luxurious club restaurant lounge at the MGM Grand, which will debut in May. The Light Group will be opening 3 new restaurants and a nightclub at Mandalay Bay in the spring. And of course, they're opening a day pool, which we've learned is very profitable to us where we have done such an entertainment environment. And last night, you might have seen that Floyd Mayweather, who has fought nowhere but the MGM Grand, will fight again there on May 4. Very few events draw as much casino play as a Mayweather event, and he has signed on for as many as 6 fights to this year, May and September, with hopefully many more to follow.","The hotel will undergo a full room remodel towards the end of the year and, as you know, will be rebranded as the Delano. We're excited about this. We believe it's going to bring a new customer data to Mandalay Bay and help further increase Mandalay's visitation. And of course, as Mandalay does, so does Luxor. So as we improve Mandalay Bay, we expect to see Luxor's results follow suit. We believe that by doing this, and we proved it last year, investing in our properties, offering new entertainment ideas, offerings to our guests, will not only enhance the customer experience, but will drive more profitability to our strip properties, increase our market share. We did so last year. We expect to do so again in 2013 and beyond. Our goal with all of this is to continue to improve free cash flow, to combine that operating free cash flow by our distributions from abroad, to continue to deleverage our balance sheet as we look strategically for a handful of high-return, high-value growth opportunities, 3 of which I've talked about today. We're excited to be here and proud of what we've accomplished, and we really believe that MGM Resorts' best days are now ahead of us. So with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over to you so we can get on with the Q&A of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, looking at the margins in Las Vegas in the fourth quarter, it probably is better than what most had forecasted, when you look back at the previous quarters and full year 2012, to what extent were margins impacted by room renovation and the like, and how sustainable are these revenue to operating expense relationships from here where you can actually see that same degree of flow-through?","James Joseph Murren","Well, when I was on your side, Joe, I hated it when companies talked about construction disruption and how it impacted results. But clearly, when you take off floors at a time and major problems that we had to solve, particularly over the MGM Grand, you do impact margins because you impact traffic. But I think that really, what's happened is we really have focused on our FTEs, which are essentially flat, down slightly. We streamlined quite a bit of our operating management so as to, not only I think make better decisions, quicker decisions, but that has a margin improvement to it. We have -- we're yielding better from a standpoint of finding guests that, not only will occupy our rooms, but spend more in nongaming and gaming areas, which has a positive impact on margin. And we believe that with relatively modest revenue growth, we should have a similar kind of improvement in margin or more as we saw in the fourth quarter. So we had a company that had higher margins than we do today. We endeavor to get back to it. And I would believe that because most of our disruptive projects are behind us, certainly the MGM would be one. We've had major projects underway at Mandalay, Luxor. I think that, that combined with a real focus on our expenses and our mix improvement on the revenue side, we expect to show better profit growth than revenue growth.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Perfect. And then, Grant, since you're on the call, obviously a lot of chatter about performance thus far this month in Macau. I'll leave this question as broad as possible, but can you give us a sense of trends or your interpretation of the VIP trends that we saw in February and what's your view of what transpired in the month? We understand that's the thing [indiscernible] I really would love to hear your thoughts on the VIP side.","Grant R. Bowie","I think it's pretty well canvassed that the first days of Chinese New Year were possibly softer than people expected. But, frankly, that's been a trend that we've now been seeing for the last 4 holiday seasons. And I do think that it is an impact of -- there's basically 2 groups of customers. During a heavy holiday season, we're seeing a lot more families, which is obviously a lot more main floor traffic. They probably don't have quite as much to spend. As that traffic departs Macau, we are really seeing in this week some strong return of some play, and that was totally consistent with what we saw in Chinese New Year last year. So it is true now that these holiday periods are not so much of the peaks that we once saw. I think what we're now seeing is that the business is much more stable right through the year. So we're still very confident. The main floor has been very busy. I actually just went for a walk because I had a few hours to kill. Traffic's looking good and VIP traffic in the junket rooms this evening is particularly, particularly strong. So I just think that we need to be careful to try to draw too many conclusions from some relatively short-term patterns that we see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dan, you highlighted in your prepared remarks the nice performance you saw in the non-Baccarat casino play. Just wondering is the trend that you saw in the fourth quarter continuing into the first quarter?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. I mean, it is, Felicia. We saw obviously some good activity, as Jim pointed out, around the Super Bowl time period. Obviously we got March Madness coming up, so that'll be another data point here to be looking at later on here in the first quarter. But we are starting to see domestic customers again, starting to see their activity pick up. And it's been a while since we've been able to say that, so we are pleased with the direction that's going.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like -- I mean, well, we've seen the many pattern for many years now is around events, business is good. But when you don't have the events, it drops off. It sounds like are you seeing that pattern change a bit?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","The events are still strong. Weekends are still strong. Midweek is still a little choppy here and there. But I think, overall, the direction that we're seeing in terms of the spend levels and the play patterns of our -- the rest of the customers are heading in the right direction.","James Joseph Murren","And I'd add, Dan, that it's been, what, over 2 years now on M life, but the M life investments we've been making are helping our midweek slot business, as well as our event-related slot business. And our marketing alliances, say, for example, the Ameristar is driving some really good business to us and for them. So I think a combination of what Dan mentioned, getting better attendance, broader attendance on these events and our marketing on M life is driving particularly high-margin slot business, which we're very pleased. And then also getting to the margin question, where you might've noticed our promo expenses are down and we're getting a more specific more targeted on how we market to our customers which should result in higher profitability as well on the casino side.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then also you guys touched on group performance at ARIA, but I was wondering if you could update us on group trends for '13 and perhaps '14 for your overall strip properties?","James Joseph Murren","Yes, we did ARIA, company-wide it's -- do you have that, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. I mean, in terms of -- Felicia, in terms of our convention block of business, it's looking to be up for the full year in terms of our mix year-over-year, '13 versus '12. We're pacing higher in '13 as a company right now at this point in time. '14 is looking even stronger as we look forward. So there's still work to do in '14, but its pace is actually even up higher than what we're experiencing here in '13.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, '13 looks like what we mentioned last quarter and '14 is picking; even a little bit more.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And the important thing to note is we have all of the rooms back online at the MGM. So our occupied room nights in that segment is going to be higher, and that's going to allow us to drive incremental room revenue in that segment and help to bolster and hopefully, improve ADRs at our luxury properties.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's gets to my question. You said pace, but you're also assuming higher rate as well?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Correct.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, it will be up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about maybe a little bit more of a strategic question, but obviously you're starting to pursue some meaningful development projects in Massachusetts and in Maryland. Could you just give us your thoughts about kind of the health of the regional consumer and how you think about now that you've refinanced the balance sheet, we've started to see some strategic consolidation in the industry again and some of your appetite for the regional markets versus, I think, investing some or more of your discretionary cash flow in either deleveraging the balance sheet or focusing it on Macau?","James Joseph Murren","Well, Maybe I'll start that, Dan, you can jump in if you like. We have no interest in acquiring assets regionally or otherwise. We have an interest in investing in markets where we feel like we can generate a great return. And we have a great interest in deleveraging the company and investing here in Las Vegas where we have so many competitive advantages. So I think there will be some M&A. I don't think we'll participate on the acquisition front there. I think that where we are looking obviously in places like western Mass where we have a tremendously large database already of M life members that live in the Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts area that are frequent customers of ours to Las Vegas and to our regional properties, that's a lucrative opportunity for us. The one at National Harbor, with literally on the Potomac, minutes away from the nation's capital, we know who we know there, and that's even -- a better international opportunity for us. As you saw, we are reapplying in New Jersey because we believe in Borgata and in our partners at Boyd. We believe that, that opportunity has merit to us. But for the most part, I don't think you'll find us in the M&A front. I think that our goals here are, if we can generate the kinds of returns we think we can in our existing results, we're going to use that cash to look at a few markets around the world, but really predominantly deleverage the company, invest in our existing assets recover the cash flows that we lost in '06 and '07. And I think that, that's the best way for the shareholders. Anything you want to add to that, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, I think from a priority standpoint, Shaun, obviously our Cotai development is and will be priority #1 given the strong free cash flow characteristics out of Macau. The capital is all in place for that project, so that's going to run its course and as we pointed out, be open in 2016. And then I think when you look at the time line of these other developments, it gives us a lot of time before we even have to be spending money if we're fortunate enough in either or both Maryland or Mass. These are projects that aren't going to open until 2016, 2017, time lines. So it gives us plenty of time to deleverage the balance sheet, get our house in order and take on those projects when we need to.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. I think that's really clear. And just one more on Macau, if I could. I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned something about re-evaluating the dividend policy for MGM China. Just wondering if you could elaborate there? And then one specific one, did you guys give an updated full budget for the Cotai project? I thought -- it sounded like the scope had changed there a little bit. I just wanted to make sure we got the number.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, the number there in Cotai is approximately $2.6 billion, excluding land and capitalized interest. It is up a little bit, mostly as it relates to the tenders we received to date, as well as we've added some scope to the project in terms of our general foundation work in some of the basements to allow for future expansion. And we intend to apply for additional GSA to expand that facility in the future, so part of the increase relates to that in our Cotai budget. And so that's really where the priority is. So as far as -- you saw this morning special dividend, we had one last year. We are going to talk next week at the board level about a formal dividend policy going forward, and you just need to stay tuned to the outcome of that board decision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A question on Vegas. Can you give us a sense of specifically targeting the midweek group segment, just competition in that segment, both in -- within Vegas amongst your competitors and then against other cities? And maybe it would be helpful to put your comments into historic context relative to the midweek group business in 2006, 2007 when it really was a seller's market?","James Joseph Murren","Let\u2019s see, maybe I'll -- you want to take that first, you want to take it?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Sure. I think, Harry, obviously that always the biggest challenge for Las Vegas, is obviously the midweek. I mean, we're comfortable with how we're filling that up. As I said, we've got more work to do on that front. But buildings like Bellagio and Mandalay and the MGM Grand and ARIA, they can create their own business. And they're doing great job at filling up as best we can and maximize the opportunity. The challenges on the citywide, we've -- we had citywide convention attendees as high as 6.3 million, 6.4 million at the peak. That kind of troughed in the low 4 millions, and for the past couple of years, we've been on about 4.9 million citywide. So it has gotten a little bit more competitive from a general marketplace standpoint with other cities that we operate. And then we're working closely with the LVCVA, and they have some real good plans going forward over the next few years. But that's still the piece that we can work on together and drive that midweek performance. And really, where that helps is kind of the mid-tier and the value-oriented properties up and down the strip. As you see, when Con Hank [ph] is in town and some of the big shows, the pricing power that those buildings get really don't focus on the convention segment, really get that uplift and that benefit and you see the flow-through. So that's really, I think, over the next couple of years, where the challenge lies. And I think between companies like ourselves and the LVCVA, we're up for the challenge.","Corey I. Sanders","Harry, I would add in the Luxor properties, peak periods, midweeks, we're fine. We fill the buildings. We get our mix where we need to. Really, it's the citywide and the core properties -- that the citywide's come back, which they will in '14. '13 is going to be a little bit down year for them, that's where our struggle is. From competition, in '06 and '07, cities like Orlando and Chicago weren't reducing their pricing. They weren't going after the business as aggressively as they are now. So that definitely is a challenge for us.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then a quick question for Grant. Grant, if you could give us your thoughts on the target market that the Cotai building is going to -- is going to focus on given that the mass market is growing faster than VIP now, and it's 3x to 4x more profitable?","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Harry. The target market for us, as we've always indicated is the mid- to upper mass market. We will obviously also balance that up with appropriate VIP junket business. But for us, it's always about trying to get that portfolio mix. And clearly the scale of the project is bigger and we have a lot more nongaming. So the mass market and the potential to drive that mass market is really important to us. And that also fits in pretty comfortably with what's actually happening out in the Cotai as a whole space, a whole geographic area. So for us it's building from the strengths that we have here. And over the next 3 years, as we build the property, we're investing considerable amounts of assets in building our data around customer analytics, learning the same sorts of opportunities that M life has given to the U.S. domestic properties. We're also applying those principles here, and it's been extremely successful for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First -- and maybe it's Bobby who could talk to this or Jim, just update on the center JV with Dubai World, any potential or movement or corporate finance solution to that property at some point? And then, Grant, you just mentioned that you were doing a segmentation of the Macau customer base. We've heard about that and I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on how that works and how that -- how much more upside there is to it. And then one final thing, and I think it was Corey who just mentioned this. There does seem to be a little bit of a dispersion within your properties on the strip with the high end doing better than the lower or the mid-priced market. Is that, Corey, due to the customer strength or that target customer or is it, as you just mentioned, more an issue about the sort of group or conference business? It wasn't clear from your answer.","James Joseph Murren","All right. I think we -- I think you hit all of us here, Steve. I'll start with CityCenter. We have a tremendously strong relationship with our partners there. And in fact, we just welcomed Dan to the board of MGM Resorts; a board member of CityCenter, Bill Grounds, who's been on the board of CityCenter with Bobby and I for many years now, is on the parent company board as well. CityCenter is always looking for ways to improve the value for its shareholders, the 50% we own and the 50% they own. One early way to do that was to try to clear out some of the residential inventory, we are obviously finally becoming successful in doing so. The overarching way do it is to drive more cash flow, and that's happily happening now. The third is to continue to improve the balance sheet, extend out maturities. We've been doing that. The fourth is looking for ways to monetize portions of CityCenter where it could make sense. And I think that the most attractive candidate down the road would be Crystals, which is one of the most successful retail -- and certainly one of the most visible and highly sought-after retail environment in the United States. And it was always, if you recall, designed initially when we designed it to be sold ultimately. That's a high target opportunity for us. It could raise a tremendous amount of money for its owners down the road. We're not in negotiations today to sell it, but you have to believe that that's something we think about down the road. And then there are other opportunities, too, from a standpoint of nongaming opportunities, whether it be Vdara or Mandarin and other opportunities we'll look at. As it relates to the relationship between the partners, it's never been stronger than it is today. And I think that both of us believe that CityCenter's higher cash flow days are upon us and that it would be best to see this property and this whole complex reach its potential, which we believe it can do over the next couple of years. But I think that's what the CityCenter board believes. Bobby, you feel it's pretty...","Robert H. Baldwin","Yes, I would agree with that, Jim. We always have opportunities to -- many opportunities, the balance sheet in particular, our debt is $1.850 million, our interest rate is a little less than 9%. We're obviously looking to refinance that at some point in time in a much lower rate given the condition of our balance sheet and the improvement in our earnings at CityCenter.","James Joseph Murren","Thank you. And then the next one is that you, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","I think it was Grant in terms of market segmentation.","Grant R. Bowie","Okay, thanks. I'm trying to be very short because most people know I can talk a long time about this. So the key for us is that it's basically a -- it's a customer value segmentation strategy and primarily is driven from the top down, from premium down. And that implies identification, geographic segmentation, but also product matching in terms of ensuring we have the right product to match the right customer groups. And that's through our customer relationship strategy. And we've actually physically segmented the property out so those customers can see and perceive the true values that each of those groupings can do. As we move out to Cotai, clearly, we start to broaden and move down that value proposition as we need to broaden the base to increase the customer penetration. So in short, that's how it works for this property. It was always designed recognizing that we are going to have multiple business units and we understood that, that what we needed to do was build a committed MGM customer, and that's what we're very excited about that we've done here. And we're even more excited about the opportunities we're going to have with expanding into Cotai.","Corey I. Sanders","And, Steve, on the convention side, without the solid citywide convention base, what ends up happening is our lower end properties, Circus and Excalibur, they're the last to fill, and there's always a challenge there from a pricing perspective. With regards to Luxor, they're also usually a benefactor of Mandalay's overfill and that hasn't quite happened as much it used to happen in the past. But it's well positioned to get that overfill coming up in the future here.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But, Corey, just -- and then I'll let it go, but this is -- I was asking more on a broader base, meaning, is the mid- or -- mid-market customer, which we're hearing from other consumer companies showing some weakness, and is that one of the reasons why your lower or middle properties are showing less strength than the higher end beyond this conference convention issue?","Corey I. Sanders","I don't -- I wouldn't say there's weakness. I think it's a supply-and-demand thing and the number of rooms. What we're seeing in the people that are staying in those hotels, they're spending the same way they were even a little bit up at some of these properties. So it's just being able to fill those hotels with the right customers. Because we won't -- there's a certain point we won't fill a hotel room.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the renovations that you're going to be doing on the main gaming floor in Macau, and also it sounds like you're not seeing any real impact from the smoking ban there. And then, Jim and -- on the new projects that you're pursuing in some of the U.S. regional markets, can you talk a little bit about returns in those markets or for those projects?","James Joseph Murren","Great. Grant, you want to start that?","Grant R. Bowie","Sure. Thanks, Jim. So on the main floor, first thing we're doing is, after 5 years, we're obviously in the work, we're actually moving back in and doing some general tidying up around the whole property. Focus for this year is going to continue to be supporting some of the premium products. We want to expand particularly for slots into supreme, which is the private high-limit main floor business. And then we also want to upgrade one area that we have, which is our Las Vegas room. And we're going to upgrade that again and making sure that we can provide a high-quality of service, complementary with both the supreme and the platinum lands we've already created. To your point on the smoking, frankly, it's probably still a little early to make a judgment on it. There is clearly some changes in pattern. There is migration and higher performance coming out of the smoking areas, particularly on our main floor, not quite so evident in our VIP business, but I think it's still a little early to see what true impact that will have, and we continue to look at ways to use the floor space as efficiently as we can. Our analytics have been very powerful in trying to position products to ensure that we can minimize those negative impacts, but obviously providing a compliant and most importantly, a safe environment for our team.","James Joseph Murren","Thank you, Grant. And, Robin, on the return front, maybe one way of looking at it is that is looking at MGM Grand Detroit, we spent on the permanent facility there a little over -- about $800 million. And last year, we made $165 million of cash flow there. We take, as you know, a different approach to regional markets. We do not go into every regional market, that's one. Two, we don't go in with a bare-minimum investment and build a $300 million, $400 million box that can easily become a commodity, and therefore, less relevant on a going-forward basis. MGM Grand Detroit has withstood an awful lot of recession and otherwise, and it's obviously doing well. It was up in the quarter, so was Beau Rivage, I think, up in the quarter and another preeminent regional property. We would expect if we were to prevail in National Harbor and\/or in Springfield, because the investments are fairly similar in the $800 million, $900 million range to get strong returns. We do not expect to build in markets where we're going to get anything lower than a high-teens return. And so I think that guides our thinking and reason why we're targeting a few higher-value markets. In the case in Toronto, where we have a 50-50 partner, it's very unclear as to what the opportunity will be, if any at all. And so it's impossible really at this point in time, to evaluate and put a return criteria on it. It's much easier for us to, and we have obviously already, developed a market side market size, a budget, a forecast for markets like western Mass and for Maryland and National Harbor. And I think looking at MGM Grand Detroit is a good guide for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Knybel with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Carlo. Just a quick one, a follow-up. I know, Dan, you've guided 1Q  REVPAR year-over-year, I believe, to flattish. Could you guys maybe talk a little bit about how you're thinking of the cadence of REVPAR throughout the year on the strip? And if there's any highlights and or maybe soft spots that you're seeing as we look out a little bit further?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Carlo, as you know, this market is highly driven on more the near term. I mean, when you look at 60% of your room inventory being filled within 60- to 90-day kind of window, it's historically been a very short booking window. We like the way our convention business is shaping up for the calendar year 2013. And obviously, the leisure and the transient business has been performing well for us, but that's a big part of our business. So I think it's too premature right now to go on with full year guidance, but we like the way the calendar is shaping up and we like the way the convention business is booked and the pace that we're on. And I think it's best to just kind of leave it at that for now.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask one follow up on the fourth quarter specifically on the strip, when you think about obviously that the hotel room revenues bringing on the extra rooms and having a little bit more strength on the casino side on a year-over-year basis, it looks like maybe some of the non-room spend was a little softer than maybe the aggregate. Is that something that you guys are seeing basically permeate throughout the portfolio or is that subject to a few properties or maybe there's some construction disruption and\/or other things going on?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","I think it's predominantly a factor of certain properties. I mean, I'll use Mandalay as an example. Mandalay Bay had -- essentially with the exception of a few events in the event center had 0 in-house entertainment in the fourth quarter this year. And in the year prior, it had both Lion King for the full quarter. And for the full month of December, it had the Cirque Michael Jackson concert that was extremely well attended for the full month of December, a slower period of time from an entertainment standpoint. So I think it's really specific to certain properties. The Grand here without Studio 54 for the past several quarters. So it's really specific to certain properties and certain venues within those properties. The flipside, Bellagio with Hyde. It's been home run at both Hyde and Bank\u2019s for the full year. So didn't skip a beat with the first full year of Hyde here at Bellagio, and The Bank has performed quite nicely and is actually consistent with the prior year so it's all incremental there.","James Joseph Murren","I think what I'd add to that, Dan, is looking at the second quarter, I'll just reemphasize what's happening for us in the second quarter between when someone spends over $100 million on the corner of Tropicana in the Las Vegas Strip in Hakkasan to build a nightclub, lounge, bar, which right now has been a construction site and has been for the better part of 9 months, is going to have a material impact on MGM Grand; having a Mayweather fight in May, a material impact on MGM Grand; having a new Cirque show at Mandalay Bay, a material impact on the second quarter for Mandalay Bay; and the restaurants that we're adding there. I think that's very much driven by our success at the room remodel at MGM and here at Bellagio, we know -- I think we have a very good idea now how to spend our capital wisely to get the best returns whether it's in higher room rates or higher nongaming spend. And now on the gaming side, when you add the private gaming villas that we just have added and the new villa here at Bellagio, we see immediate impact in terms of customer response. It gives us more evidence as to how to spend our money in the future.","Corey I. Sanders","Yes, Mandalay's investments is about close to $100 million also. The clubs, the show and restaurants. So it's a significant investment that should bring some good lift to the property.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And Mandalay has never had a show like this that's going in here, I mean, this is 2 shows a night, 5 days a week. I mean they never had that kind of stickiness from an entertainment-venue perspective at Mandalay.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Susan Berliner with JPMorgan.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to focus on CityCenter, if I may. You had a lot of cash sitting there, and I guess, I wanted to know what are your plans for that cash. And also the condo proceeds that are sitting there, does that get returned to MGM? And if you could just talk about, I guess, going forward, kind of the leverage target at CityCenter.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Sure, I'll take a stab at those. So as far as the cash that's building up, we do intend on continuing to reduce leverage, whether it'd be through debt reduction or as Bobby mentioned earlier, continuing to improve the cash flows where we as partners are not pleased with where the overall leverage is on the campus right now. And that'll be the focus with the excess cash and the improving cash flows going forward will be to reduce debt and continue to improve leverage there. And at some point in time in the future, you can rest assure that both partners have a lot invested in this and we will be looking to pull money out of that venture in the future. As far as the condo proceeds, we as an MGM Resort are still owed roughly about $100 million in advance condo proceeds that we made under the completion guarantee agreements. Those funds will sit in the condo proceeds account until the Perini matters are resolved and reach their conclusion, so those dollars will -- can't be spent and will sit there until such time if that matter is resolved.","","And, operator, with that, I think we've gone slightly over our allotted time. We're around all day for any follow-up questions with anyone here in the office. Please feel free to reach out for us, and thanks again for joining us this morning.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Catherine Park. Please go ahead.","Catherine Park","Thank you, Chad. Good afternoon and welcome to the MGM Resorts International second quarter 2019 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com and we have also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC. On this call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws.

You can find a reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jim Murren.","James Murren","Well, thank you, Cathy, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a fairly straightforward quarter with minimal deviations one way or another. We\u2019re extremely busy on executing on our MGM 2020 plan. Our operating model transition is complete, and our headcount reductions as part of this transition is now behind us. We continue to make progress with our real estate committee and we hope to report back to you in the coming months.","As we look to the future, we expect to benefit from quite a few tailwinds with improving property earnings, strong Las Vegas macro trends and MGM 2020 benefiting us in the back half of this year and into next year. This gives us the confidence in our ability to hit our financial targets next year, and as an example of this confidence, we bought back 11 million shares in the second quarter alone.","So let\u2019s get into the second quarter. We came in pretty much in line with our expectations with consolidated net revenues up 13% and adjusted EBITDA up 9% year-over-year to $756 million. We have lower hold at our Strip properties and some one-time items that totaled about $35 million. And I guess the best help understand the earnings power of the business you\u2019re probably going to want to add those two numbers together. Here in Las Vegas results were in line with expectations as we saw strong demand across our hotel, food and beverage and entertainment segments driving 1% growth in overall net revenues.","Our non-gaming revenues were actually up 5%, REVPAR up 2.3% driven by both occupancy and rate, and this was led by strong demand in all of our segments. Gaming revenues declined by 12%, which was two-thirds driven by overall table games hold and one-third driven by baccarat volume, partially offsetting this were stable mass gaming trends as our non-bac table games were roughly flat and our slot handle was actually up year-over-year.","Our Strip EBITDA declined 4% to $418 million mostly driven by lower than normal table games hold of 21%. As a reminder, we\u2019re also comping against a 25% table games hold percentage in the second quarter of 2018. And the year-over-year EBITDA hold impact was roughly $26 million that\u2019s about 6% of our Strip EBITDA.","On the hold adjusted basis, Strip EBITDA was actually up 2% year-over-year to $436 million. The baccarat volumes are still down year-over-year and that\u2019s driven by less Far East play. Second quarter volumes have actually leveled out from the first quarter and that\u2019s consistent with our forecast. To size for you, Far East baccarat represents just about 6% or 7% of our Strip EBITDA, and so the lower level of play represents only about 3% of our Strip EBITDA.","Our second quarter Strip EBITDA margins were 28.5% that was down 145 basis points year-over-year, but excluding the impact of baccarat and year-over-year hold variance, our EBITDA margins would have been actually up slightly.","Turning to our Regional properties, we of course, have many of the premier assets across the United States and we are the profit leader in many of the markets in which we operate. And this helps us drive market share gains over our peer group. And our original properties continue to perform well in the second quarter, revenues were up 29%, EBITDA was up 34% with the majority of the growth coming from the inclusion of Springfield, Empire City and Northfield Park.","EBITDA at our Mississippi properties increased 24% during the quarter and continued to benefit from the increased visitation because of sports betting, and this is encouraging for us as more states come online with that product.","Over to MGM China, revenues grew 26% to $706 million and adjusted property EBITDA was up 43% to $171 million that\u2019s due to continued ramping of MGM Cotai. We did have a weaker than normal VIP hold in the quarter, which negatively impacted EBITDA by about $10 million.","And as we all know the VIP market had been a bit rugged, but the mass for us continues to show strength. By property, MGM Macau achieved EBITDA of $116 million, up 17% year-over-year. Mass business there was stable, and though as I said VIP volumes were impacted by somewhat by transitioning some of the junket rooms over to MGM Cotai.","MGM Cotai continued its ramp with $56 million of EBITDA, up $171 million \u2013 171% over the prior year quarter. Our Mansion is still fairly new and ramping, 20 villas are open, seven more will follow shortly. And these villas are already allowing us to better attract premium mass customers. And as always, Grant is on the line to answer your questions.","Moving to MGM 2020, we\u2019re happy with our progress in MGM 2020. We now believe, we will achieve $100 million of EBITDA uplift this year versus our prior guidance of $70 million. While, we think it\u2019s a bit early to revise our overall MGM 2020 guidance. The progress we\u2019ve made thus far gives us increased confidence that we will achieve our phase 1 goal of $200 million in incremental EBITDA by the end of 2020.","As I mentioned earlier, our operating model work is now complete, and while we have reduced our fixed labor, it\u2019s important to know that MGM 2020 is not just a cost cutting exercise. We\u2019re laying the groundwork to position the company for future growth creating efficiencies and giving our properties the ability to scale key initiatives and best practices. And so it\u2019s worth taking a moment to talk about our thinking.","We spent years refining our structure with some of the most expert management consultants to land on this model. Models designed to faster collaborative relationships between our Centers of Excellence or COEs, and the properties. While strategies are set in enforced at the COE level, this is after thorough due diligence and guidance from the properties. COEs also ensure that the brand identity of each property is preserved and the MGM portfolio offerings are complementary to each other, which also minimizes cannibalization. Further, we have kept senior leadership at the property level. This is especially the case at the regional properties where we know market knowledge and physical presence is key.","Property presence remain keenly focused on the customer experience and employee engagement, in fact, by centralizing the strategic functions with our COEs, and our portfolio presidents as well as clarifying realigning roles and responsibilities. Our property leaders can focus their full attention to enhancing the customer experience. While this has been a transformative change internally, it\u2019s worth repeating. We have not been distracted in our day to day operations and the customer experience has not been adversely impacted.","So let me provide some numbers on phase 1. By the end of May, we reduced headcount by 1,070 people resulting in approximately $100 million of annualized savings. These were nearly all managerial or supervisory positions. It was a 12% reduction off the base of around 8,700 positions with some more back office departments seeing heavier reductions. On the other phase 1 components we\u2019re making good progress on variable labor, sourcing and revenue optimization.","We expect to implement the majority of these initiatives by year end. And so looking out further for 2019, we feel comfortable where the Strip consensuses for the year. This outlook reflects client volumes that remain at current levels and as we\u2019ve highlighted in our previous calls the majority of the building blocks for the rest of our business is improving throughout the back half of this year.","The fundamental backdrop in Las Vegas remains very sound, and we see robust demand in nearly all of our business segments. And convention bookings in Las Vegas continue to shape up very nicely in the second half, and are actually tracking better than we expected earlier in the year. In fact, we\u2019re expecting a near record convention mix this year. We\u2019re benefiting from a couple favorable group rotations. And our expansions at MGM Grand and Aria are helping drive momentum into next year.","And over the medium-term, the Las Vegas convention center expansion is expected to drive even more citywide business to the city. And while leisure booking windows are naturally always shorter, current trends are also improving there, especially as we progress through the summer months. This is helped by the strong base of our group business, but we also continue to strategically manage our leisure mix to place the right customers in the right hotels at the right time, and opportunistically lean in to fill in periods where we need to.","Our entertainment calendar in the second half of this year is one of the strongest in the company\u2019s history. We\u2019re maximizing our leadership in live entertainment and sports. Of course, we just hosted the MGM Resorts NBA Summer League were sold out its first two days and hit new attendance records in the dead heat of the summer.","The Las Vegas Aces which currently by the way are number one in the WNBA, will host the All-Star Game this weekend at its home at Mandalay Bay. Mandalay also recently hosted the NHL Awards ceremony, and of course the NFL Draft is also coming to Las Vegas next year.","And finally and excitingly, the Las Vegas\u2019 home of the Raiders Stadium continues to shift the center of gravity down to the mid to southern end of the Las Vegas Strip. Raiders Stadium will be a catalyst for our south Strip resorts, especially Mandalay Bay as we will take full advantage of its location by hosting the most awesome tailgating experience before and after all of the events at the stadium.","Before we turn over to questions, I\u2019d like to touch on a few of our key strategic objectives. We remain committed to our long-term growth strategy and are on track to achieve our stated goals of between $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow per share of $3.50 by the end of 2020. The key drivers remain the ramp up of our newly opened properties and our project MGM 2020. Our major development projects are complete and our CapEx is dramatically lower and known.","Our properties are all in excellent shape with no deferred CapEx, and as such we expect to generate accelerating free cash flow, and while we are far from done, we\u2019ve worked diligently this year executing on our MGM 2020. Our operating model today gives us far more control over our cost base and positions us well through this cycle. We are running a very disciplined capital allocation strategy, which is focused on reducing our net leverage to between 3 and 4 times on a consolidated basis by the end of 2020.","We aim for steady growth in our dividend and to buy back shares where appropriate. We have further opportunities to create long-term value in four key areas being Japan, Sports, Digital and by maximizing the value of our real estate. And so before we get to the Q&A, let me quickly touch on our real estate committee, which has been in the news lately.","As you know the committee was formed back in January and has been working diligently with the help of its advisors. Our work streams are right on track with our internal timetable. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the committee is exploring all options with very clear guideposts in mind. Any recommendation must support MGM\u2019s goals of enhancing free cash flow per share, maximizing the value of our owned real estate, preserving the company\u2019s financial flexibility and creating sustainable shareholder value. And I am increasingly optimistic that the committee\u2019s work will achieve these goals and anticipate sharing their results in early fall.","And so with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph Greff","Good afternoon, everybody. Jim, with respect to MGM 2020 and the updated target for 2019, the $100 million versus the prior $70 million. Can you talk about what that $30 million relates to? And is it more of a timing issue than just finding more cost, more efficiency? And then within the $100 million benefit to this year, can you talk geographically or what reportable segments should we see this EBITDA uplift from?","James Murren","Sure, Joe. I\u2019m going to turn that over to Corey Sanders, who really has been leading the charge more than anyone else, and is leading a group of very talented men and women here to achieve these better-than-expected results.","Corey Sanders","Hey, Joe. 2020 is about literally 50 different initiatives and the $100 million and the upping of it is really from the initial operating model work, which we felt was going to be more around the $80 million number. So we exceeded in that area and we\u2019re exceeding in some other areas also. We just want to make sure that all the other initiatives also have the same impact that this one does. So in general, as of now, it\u2019s money that we think is not necessarily additional yet that we\u2019re willing to bank, but we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic and confident about 2020.","And then, I think your second question was on the impact in each area? Was that correct?","Joseph Greff","Right. Reportable segments or geographic segments, right.","Corey Sanders","Yeah. So 60% of it is going to probably impact the Strip, 30% will impact regionals, and 10% will impact corporate.","Joseph Greff","Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is for Grant, good morning to you. Grant, just trying to get a sense of the ramp in the 2Q at MGM Cotai, the $56 million of EBITDA in the quarter, how much of that was more weighted towards the back half of the quarter just with that The Mansion ramping? And so maybe just trying to get a sense what sort of the exit sort of quarterly run rate was for the coming out of June? And that\u2019s all for me. Thanks.","Grant Bowie","Thanks, Joe. Good question. And yes, obviously, we were actually pretty pleased to see the price of the ramp up increase. So yes, there was an additional enhanced earnings in the second half. The critical point with The Mansion, and as I think we\u2019ve always discussed is, we\u2019re actually building momentum and we\u2019re actually seeing that growing pretty well. So I would \u2013 what I would prefer to say is that we\u2019re continuing to see the pace of that growth continuing into the third quarter. And we\u2019re pretty happy with how we\u2019re seeing it.","And most importantly we\u2019re seeing really solid return visitation. We\u2019ll have all the villas online by the end of September, which is great, and because we\u2019re now starting to run into demand issues, which is really positive, and then we can start cranking the yield. So the pacing is good, primarily in mass, but also seeing some really solid performance growth from returning reactivated in-house VIP customers as well.","Joseph Greff","Thanks, guys. Good job.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","So Jim and Corey, thanks for the detail on the 2020 plan, I think it\u2019s really clear. I guess, as investors start to think out now that you\u2019ve started to hit your stride here. Can you give us, I know, we want to steer clear of any sort of hard guidance? But can you give us your view on sort of just what is kind of the baseline underlying kind of earnings growth or algorithm, you are expecting for the portfolio as we start to think out 12 months and 24 months from today on this kind of new earnings stream? Just how do you think about broad based cost growth that you\u2019re trying to fight? And then how do you think about sort of your \u2013 what you would expect this portfolio can do on sort of the top-line basis to sustain or grow margin?","James Murren","So first, at this stage, we\u2019re just going to reiterate that $200 million number. If you recall back in the PGP plan, I think, we\u2019re about 9 to 10 months into that before we revised the number at all. So we\u2019re a little bit early relative to that period to talk through what could happen going forward. But I will say that the institutional memory of that and the horsepower we have here gives us a lot of confidence in how holistically we\u2019re tackling this plan.","And I have to say, I have to reiterate this, because it\u2019s not just the cost cutting plan and it\u2019s not oriented the way PGP was, this is literally a reengineering our business from the top down in a way that is very unique to the gaming industry and is more akin to our companies and other industries. And I think probably, Disney would be a good example of that, where we are using the best talent we have organizationally in the company from a corporate perspective and marrying that together with really strong operating people at the properties. And certainly, it gives us more flexibility on a more real time basis to manage our expenses.","Corey Sanders","Yeah. And what I would add, Shaun, is on the inflationary cost of our business, we feel the organic growth should more than offset that and anything that we do here on MGM 2020 phase 1 should all go to the bottom line. And as Jim mentioned, the pure costs we could take out there, not just what we\u2019ve done on the labor, but even on the sourcing side, where we spend approximately $2.6 billion a year in product and services, we think there is opportunities there to also increase the bottom line of the company and achieve our margin goals.","Shaun Kelley","Great. Thank you very much. And then just as a follow-up, the other big theme in the quarter was there were some significant consolidation as it relates to Las Vegas and Regional gaming. Maybe it has to do with a lot of the alignment that you\u2019re laying out here, but it also has to do with what you\u2019ve done so far between Northfield Park, Springfield, Borgata et cetera. How are you guys thinking about database and the importance of Regional gaming network and feeding Las Vegas as just overall strategy and how you\u2019re positioned for that? That\u2019s it from me.","James Murren","Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll take the M&A part of that, and then maybe Bill or Corey can take that. Just to be crystal clear here, we like what we own, and I\u2019m not really interested in owning much anything else. We didn\u2019t look at the Caesars assets before the El Dorado trade and we\u2019re certainly not going to look at them now. We\u2019re not looking at other opportunities to own bricks-and-mortar businesses simply to be in a market. As we\u2019ve said, if we don\u2019t believe we could be a market leader and bring an entertainment component to a resort, we\u2019re not interested in investing the shareholders\u2019 money just to be bigger.","We do believe that sports betting is going to continue to provide over time, a really strong opportunity for the company, not only in and of itself, but more importantly to enhance the profitability of our existing resorts, and Mississippi is a really good example of that, and more profoundly you\u2019re going to see that in other states as time goes by. But I would say that, that is our strategy from a corporate allocation perspective. And as it relates to the loyalty, I\u2019ll turn it over to you, Bill.","Bill Hornbuckle","Thanks, Jim. A couple of different perspectives to look at, obviously, with our Regional strategy, it\u2019s been a couple of years now, since we took over management of Borgata, and therefore, we now have full access to that database. Obviously, Springfield is ramping and growing, and now with the advent of Northfield Park and Empire, we\u2019ve added over a 1.25 names to our database. And so what\u2019s relevant about that is, what we do with them.","Interestingly, Empire City had its best quarter ever, the second quarter, since right before the aqueduct opening. And so we\u2019re encouraged by both of those businesses and we\u2019re also encouraged by our ability to get cross-regional play and cross-traffic in and out of Las Vegas. Park MGM has helped that. We\u2019ve had over a 0.25 million sign ups since that new brand has been launched. And we\u2019ve seen our cross-play go up close to 50% and our room nights about the same from when it was just about a year-ago.","So I think the strategy in the Northeast of note is working. Our ability to import people back and forth from Maryland, New Jersey, now from Empire into Springfield, and ultimately to Las Vegas as a price are starting to pay off.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. So Jim earlier in your prepared remarks, you talked about your EBITDA goals for MGM 2020, which we all know very well. And you reiterated the drivers of that, which are \u2013 which included in there are ramps of your \u2013 ramping of your new properties. And in the past, it\u2019s been suggested that the new properties could look something like the following, $350 million to $400 million in Macau, slightly below $100 million in Springfield, and Park MGM around $100 million. So just based on what you know now, are you wondering \u2013 I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s still seems achievable?","James Murren","Yeah. As you know, we haven\u2019t gotten into the property by property building blocks. We have said that those ramps are part of our guidance, but we do know how those properties are doing, all of them. And even with what we know, we are reiterating those cash flow numbers for next year and the free cash flow numbers. And the reason why we\u2019re doing so is that we do see continued growth in those properties, and frankly, a better macro setup here in Las Vegas than we talked about late last year.","There is no doubt that Las Vegas is doing better, and we will continue, we believe, to do better here at the back half of 2019 and into 2020. And some of the business we have on the books on multiple channels. And I think it\u2019s encouraging, very encouraging to think about not only that convention mix, right, Corey, but also look at our core properties and how they\u2019re doing here in Las Vegas, look at their margin growth and understand where the leisure businesses right now. This is a very dynamic company.","So if we are behind in someplace, like we\u2019re behind in Springfield, we\u2019re ahead in many other places and that is the value of being diversified company. And also, very frankly, we have a very good understanding of this project 2020 initiative, and we dug deeper than we discussed in the first half of this year and that\u2019s going to accrue to the benefit of the back half and into 2020.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. That\u2019s a helpful perspective. I appreciate that. And Grant, hello. I know, you\u2019ve talked a bit on the call about \u2013 you\u2019re the ramp of Cotai, but I also know that you\u2019re optimistic about the potential for Peninsula, which slightly outperformed expectations. So just wondering, if you could update us in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that property in light of the Cotai property ramping, and then just in light of the market in general?","Grant Bowie","Okay. So if we look at the market in general first, we\u2019re still positive, optimistic as we always are in the mass market. And obviously, and that\u2019s the way we positioned ourselves. Junket market I think is going through correction, and I don\u2019t think there is any indicator that we\u2019re going to see any significant change in those growth patterns. On that regard, therefore, focus for Macau is obviously to replace any of the customer traffic that we shifted to Cotai, which has stabilized significantly and we\u2019re starting to see share in that regard. And we are really positive.","Now the refurbishment of Cotai and Macau continues, and we\u2019ve been working on the east of the casino in the last three, four months, which is obviously the area, where we \u2013 if we were going to see any effect of that, it was going to occur. And we\u2019ve had some, but not significant. We\u2019re accelerating that work to get it done before the October holiday. So we\u2019re really positive on just the momentum, the focus and the intensity [for cut] [ph] from Macau. And so that\u2019s solid, got a good management team and they are dedicated just to that property.","Again, I just want to reiterate that the continued performance in Cotai, we\u2019re really starting to see collective momentum in terms of not just in The Mansion, we keep on talking about that, because that\u2019s a step-up for us, but across the premium mass area in that property consistently. Sign-ups\u2019 continues. It looks positive.","Our quest to increase market share is undaunting, but obviously with the market as it is, becoming increasingly more difficult, but we\u2019re still really positive that every quarter we\u2019ve been able to just take a little bit more and a little bit more and that\u2019s just something we\u2019re going to keep focusing on. So continued momentum in the mass, that\u2019s where the growth is and obviously in Cotai we\u2019re also now starting to work through to make sure that we can \u2013 we right-size the OpEx relative to the performance of the property as well.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you. It\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Hello, everyone. I wanted to first follow-up with you, Grant. The roughly 24% margin in the second quarter, it looks like there could be several hundred basis points of eventual upside. Can you talk about that, because at least on the Peninsula in 2017, you achieved 28%? And do you get economies of scale that might get you even beyond 28% depending upon the mix within some reasonable time frame?","Grant Bowie","That\u2019s a related question, Harry. I think, we\u2019ve always continued to give guidance on them, but we see the stabilized margin in that sort of 26% to 27% range. Yes, we really were able to crank out some really significant higher 20s in Macau for a period. I think, we recognize that Cotai is a much bigger property, some of the reinvestment rates in Cotai are higher. Yes, of course, we will always strive for those sorts of numbers, but I\u2019m still giving that guidance that we think it\u2019s \u2013 that will be pretty comfortable in the 27%. But \u2013 at last, we\u2019re going to continue to strive to get the most that we can.","Harry Curtis","Is it too aggressive to think that you can get there by 2020 or is that probably closer to 2021?","Grant Bowie","Harry, if we were to see some significant market growth, I think all of those things are possible. I think, one of those \u2013 margin is also dependent upon the strength of the market and what\u2019s the price you have to pay to generate the revenue. So if you\u2019re getting a lot of organic market growth, yes, that\u2019s possible. But I would suggest that\u2019s probably the trick or the trigger for that.","Harry Curtis","Very good. And then returning to Vegas. Jim, I had just a quick follow-up question that encompasses the size of the Vegas portfolio. And really, the kind of the mix of your third-party booking engines. Is there any thought to actually shrinking the size of the portfolio to match the size of M life? Would that make sense as a means of increasing efficiency and reducing the reliance on third-party booking engines, particularly given the cyclical nature of the group meeting and convention business?","James Murren","So I\u2019ll start, then I\u2019ll turn it over to maybe Corey or Bill to jump in. We look at everything, we view our business as \u2013 our leadership in our business as portfolio managers. And we certainly look at all of our properties, not only individually, but what they might be able to do for one another. And in terms of how we manage the business, we do see scale certainly by having more than one property here on the Strip. I think that it\u2019s certainly worth noting that some of our properties do better than others. But most of all of them are in our database in our M life programs. The outlier, of course, is Circus Circus. Circus Circus is not part of M life. And has not been integrated fully within the MGM Resorts portfolio. All of our other properties certainly have. But we do look at how we\u2019re running this company as a portfolio, and we do know, and the Summer League was a very good example, having properties at multiple price points is a great benefit to us. And even the week before that, having Microsoft in-house and having properties at multiple price points is a great benefit to us in the convention side. As it relates to OTAs...","Corey Sanders","Yes. What I would add, Harry, we manage our business and especially who are putting the rooms on a gross profit per segment. And we have a good understanding of all of our segments. And even that OTA segment has profitabilities that drive incremental EBITDA and pretty decent margin business because they don\u2019t have a lot of investment other than the fee associated with OTAs. We used it more stellar and more strategically toggling up and down on those as we need them. And we think that the balance that we have right now is probably the best we\u2019ve had in a few years.","James Murren","And based on what I said about the leisure business, is a good example of that.","Bill Hornbuckle","And I\u2019ll just add, Harry, as a final that our OTA partners, our partners are important to our business. And so on the collective, well, at times, I understand the question and nature of it, it\u2019s important that we\u2019re on balance, and we think we\u2019ve managed that relatively well. They can be demanding at times, but they are great partners in the totality of it all.","Operator","The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli","Jim, I was wondering if you or Corey could kind of opine a little bit as it pertains to the real estate committee. How are you guys are kind of thinking about the balance between opco, propco? Clearly there\u2019s still a healthy amount of EBITDAR that you guys wholly own on the Strip and then own indirectly through MGP. But when you think about balancing the financing that it provides you, as well as kind of the ownership versus opco kind of model, what is your personal view?","James Murren","Well, a few things that are abundantly clear to us here, and we\u2019ve learned an awful lot over the last 6 or 7 months as we\u2019ve really dug into with some of the smartest tax, corporate finance, accounting people that work for our company. And with our advisors, both financial, legal and tax advisors that we have a lot of options in front of us, actually very creative and interesting options in front of us. We also know that our real estate is misvalued in the marketplace. That\u2019s clear just based on traits that are happening all around, vis-\u00e0-vis the owned assets that MGM has today, including the one we\u2019re speaking to you from here at Bellagio. Thirdly, the real estate committee is completely aligned with the full Board, which is to say, anything that we do will be enhancing to our financial objectives, particularly because we\u2019re acutely aware that we\u2019re in the later stages of an economic expansion.","Anything that we do, anything that we think about going forward will be to improve this company\u2019s financial outlook, both in terms of its balance sheet and its earnings power. And there is a mix between owning assets and operating them. But we do believe that an asset lighter model makes sense with the key privado, which is that the operating company, which is responsible for the CapEx of all the properties under this model, is if anything stronger than before. Because what we won\u2019t do is sell assets and diminish the value of MGM Resorts. So we have a lot of work we have done. We are glad we\u2019ve taken the time. We\u2019re certainly glad we didn\u2019t have any knee-jerk reaction to ideas that were thrust upon us a year ago. And we\u2019re more educated today than we ever before, and that is why I say that we\u2019re coming toward the end of our decision-making process and that you\u2019ll hear from us later this year.","Carlo Santarelli","That\u2019s very helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. You mentioned that you were comfortable with Strip consensus for this year, which I believe on property level, Las Vegas Strip basis is about $1.7 billion give or take a couple million of dollars. Is that the number you were referring to?","James Murren","That is, yes.","Operator","The next person comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Two quick follow-ups. First on Park MGM. It looks like, yes, it\u2019s starting to ramp up again here. How should investors be thinking about the cadence? And are you seeing or expecting any cannibalization or even halo benefits in the properties around it?","Bill Hornbuckle","Steve, and this is Bill. I\u2019ll try to tackle that one. Look, our full ramp will be through 2021 to get to, I think, full value, we\u2019ve still got a couple of assets opening what we\u2019ve seen with entertainment has been absolutely spectacular. Italy is performing exceptionally well. NoMad, literally has the second highest MPS score in the company. And so all of those assets are doing well. Where we need some stickiness, frankly and interestingly, is in the casino on unrated play. We\u2019re focused on it; we\u2019re programming against it. Of note, the entertainment component and if you look at \u2013 and obviously, we\u2019re situated, you\u2019ve got T-Mobile and Park Theater, which are literally the Top 2 grossing arenas and midsized theaters in the world right now, driving massive amounts of traffic to the property. And so over time, we\u2019re figuring how to take full benefit of that. Obviously, Park Theater is ultimately Aria showroom by way of example. And we leveraged against that if you see the marquee today driving down I-15, you\u2019d understand that relationship. And so we\u2019re pleased with the ramp, we\u2019ve got some work to do, there\u2019s a couple more assets coming on board. But overall, it\u2019s really through to 2021 that you\u2019ll see full benefit of it.","Corey Sanders","And then what I would add is we\u2019ve definitely seen the benefit in the neighborhood. New York-New York had a tremendous month. The second quarter revenues are really close to their top EBITDA. And we\u2019re seeing also the flow-through and even Aria, which is continuing to probably outgrow its peers in REVPAR on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Stephen Grambling","And once the bridge opened....","Bill Hornbuckle","Yes. That\u2019s a good strip. And one of those elements is the pedestrian bridge finishes in October of this year, which will take a great deal of eastbound traffic over to the West side of the Strip, which, obviously, is our sweet spot.","Stephen Grambling","That\u2019s helpful. And I guess, the second follow-up is just on Macau. And I realize Cotai is still ramping, but how are you evaluating and prioritizing reinvestment or even expansion there over the next few years? And how dependent is your thought process on further clarity on the next concession renewal?","James Murren","Grant, do you want to tackle that?","Grant Bowie","Sure. So on the capital front, first. As I think we\u2019ve already announced, we\u2019re deep into the process of design of the additional suites for the completion of what is the top tier at south tower. And at the same time, we\u2019re also starting on a very preliminary Phase 2 expansion strategy. When we built the property, we actually built foundations for expansion. We\u2019re now working through that in terms of product mix, product requirements, et cetera. Not likely to see any investment and not its significance until around 2021, 2022. On the concession renewal, we continue to do exactly the same as we have always done, and that is just continue to be responsive and perform the way we had. Obviously, with Pansy, she\u2019s able to provide us a lot of insights and lot of engagement, and we just continue to work diligently through. There\u2019s no \u2013 with the elections coming up, the new Chief Executive onshore will have designed policy position on that. And so right now, we\u2019re all working through those processes, that making sure we continue to do the things that we know we\u2019re focused on, small and medium-sized businesses, the localization strategy, all of those things that came up in the midterm review to make sure we\u2019re well positioned as well as looking for other initiatives to build our business. So we\u2019re still positive, don\u2019t see any reason that we shouldn\u2019t be successful. But what we do \u2013 totally understand that this is a decision for the Macau government.","Operator","The next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming.","John DeCree","Just I guess two high-level questions for me. One maybe for Corey, it sounds like you\u2019ve picked up some group business in the back half of the year. I was wondering if you can elaborate on that if it was sales-driven or existing groups may be getting bigger?","And then Jim, at a high level, it sounds like this quarter versus when we spoke last time on this call, last quarter, a little bit of incremental confidence in the outlook. Maybe because one of the other sides of the labor program of MGM 2020, maybe it\u2019s some of the health we\u2019re seeing in non-gaming in Las Vegas, but are we kind of hearing that right a little bit more optimistic and really, if that\u2019s accurate, kind of what\u2019s driving that and if it sounds broad-based? But just kind of wanted to recap. I think you\u2019ve talked a little bit about it throughout the call, but I think it\u2019s important to kind of get those high-level views again.","James Murren","Sure. Do want to go first, Corey? Or do you want to...","Corey Sanders","Sure. In the back of the year, the majority of the increase is a bit in the year for the year bookings, in particular, at MGM in Mandalay Bay.","James Murren","Yes. And just looking at what we\u2019ve been seeing, yes, we\u2019re in the second half of the year, we\u2019ve a lot more data in front of us than we did even last quarter call, certainly at the beginning of the year. And few of the things that are highly encouraging, what we\u2019re seeing on the non-bac table side, good news, we are seeing in non-gaming very good news. The convention bookings have been stronger than we talked about before. And the leisure business, which of course, was very challenging last year going into the summer, is anything but this year. In a way, that\u2019s a big difference. The entertainment calendar is I think, the best we\u2019ve seen in an awful long time. And the expansions to our facilities, which certainly hadn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m talking convention now, which certainly hadn\u2019t fully actualized before are certainly helping now.","And so there are changes to what we\u2019re seeing here in Las Vegas that provide more tailwinds than we had talked about. And we actually are now \u2013 when you get into this part of the year, you start thinking more and getting more information about next year. We had a very constructive point of view for quite some time on the year 2020 here in Las Vegas, and we have more data now to show that I think we\u2019re going to be right. Raiders Stadium is going to open up. AEG now is booking that venue; they\u2019re expecting over 40 events a year coming into that venue. I think there\u2019s just, was it today, Bill, about the Pac-12?","Bill Hornbuckle","Yes, obviously, this morning, they announced \u201820 and \u201821 Pac-12 football tournament here in Las Vegas.","James Murren","In December, which obviously, for the community in the town is in a hole that you would, in otherwise, fill up that scale, so it\u2019s really exciting. And again, reminding everyone literally in our backdoor of Mandalay. And one of the things that Bill and his team are working on is how do we maximize the benefit of having the stadium, which is how do we maximize the foot traffic, footfall into Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur in creating this pedestrian experience because recall that they\u2019re going to shut down Hacienda to vehicular traffic. So people are going to congregate around our properties, walk across I-15 into the stadium and walk back. The other infrastructure improvements certainly are benefiting on the entire community. So I would say that what we\u2019re seeing on the convention side, the leisure business, our ability on 2020 to yield evermore effectively are all positive signs. And what we\u2019re seeing now on cross marketing because of our regional acceleration, is drawing more business into Las Vegas in the non-rated table play, non-bac table play and in slots.","And maybe one other just symbol, I guess, which is going to cause compression in rooms, which is great for the whole town, but notably us. Our friends at AG booked a festival called the Day N Vegas, first weekend in November. It booked 60,000 tickets in 1.5 day. So the appeal on the draw of this community is still pretty incredible. And so, obviously, 60,000 folks will cause a significant amount of compression and that we can. So not only that was he did, we can buy any stretch, but the compression will drive rates and just continued enthusiasm for coming.","Bill Hornbuckle","Imagine, isn\u2019t the Pac-12 tournament during NFR?","James Murren","It\u2019s right after this year.","John DeCree","It depends in the year.","James Murren","Yes. So there\u2019s a lot going on that\u2019s benefiting, and we\u2019re really excited for mentions regarding in this sphere, that\u2019s going to be another incredible draw to town and certainly we\u2019re looking forward to Resorts World opening up. There\u2019s \u2013 the amount of infrastructure being invested in Las Vegas by so many different parties is going to benefit the entire town, and that\u2019s good for us.","John DeCree","Congratulations on the quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","So just talking about Macau. So Grant, one of your peers reported yesterday, and their deck highlighted how premium mass revenues were down year-over-year, and the rest of mass was up. Are you seeing that trend, too? And how do you think it\u2019s going to kind of go going forward?","Grant Bowie","Simply no. We\u2019re still seeing solid premium mass games and building, maybe we\u2019re in a slightly different cycle to others. But I would also acknowledge that mid-mass is also pretty strong coming in the summer, it can be a bit difficult to judge whether the gaming business continues to grow through the summer. But this seems to be pretty positive. So overall for us, we are comfortable that there\u2019s growth there for us, both in the principal segments that we\u2019re running in. So we\u2019re not seeing that effect.","Thomas Allen","Helpful. And then just shifting gears to Vegas. We\u2019re deep in the Q&A, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all happy that there has been questions on REVPAR but I\u2019m firstly, going to ruin that. Just on REVPAR, I mean the fact that there has been a shift focus away from REVPAR, is that helping you manage your business better? And any way to quantify that? Or target about how it manifests itself would be helpful?","Bill Hornbuckle","Tom, again, it\u2019s Bill. The answer to your question is yes, it has helped us think about our business. Look, we managed the REVPAR and ultimately, in some instances, particularly looking at casino marketing, and some of the lower quadrants of our M life database, the cash on cash business, we\u2019re looking to make the most money by yielding occupied rooms on the totality of the basis. And so whether we\u2019re up 1, 2, 3 or 4 percentage points in REVPAR, while always meaningful and somewhat of an indicator, the bigger indicator is how we\u2019re doing in the collective. And I think particularly over the last several months in this year, we\u2019ve managed up casino a couple of ticks in marketing, a couple hundred basis points to the expense of leisure, which I think is ultimately been to our betterment.","Operator","The next question will be from David Katz with Jefferies.","David Katz","Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier topics around opco and propco. And Jim, you used the term asset light, and it\u2019s one that we debate actively from the perspective that asset light in some circles can refer to fee streams, versus what we have seen in gaming where assets are owned by a REIT, but much of the financial servicing of it is still borne by the operator. And I just wonder how you sort of think about that issue since the term came up?","James Murren","Sure. We have studied a lot of the models as you study and analyze, and we\u2019re certainly not a hotel management company that have relationships with different REITs. We are a company that is in the entertainment business that creates specific entertainment experiences for our guests. We also know that we can expand our revenue streams by using our expertise in noncapital-intensive ways. And I think sports betting is a really good example of what will happen over time as we use our brand and our expertise in entertainment to drive revenue and profit without expending a lot of capital.","I think also what\u2019s happening here in Las Vegas, finding people to partner with us or encouraging people through partnerships of using our land where they use investments, also through joint ventures will help us. We also are in the non-gaming business. And we feel that there is really no company out there in the hotel space that\u2019s better than we are in developing and managing hotels. We\u2019re doing that in China. We\u2019ll be doing that elsewhere as well, those are capital-light projects where we can deploy some of our expertise and some of our knowledge. We are responsible for the CapEx of the properties that we are operating. And so an asset lighter model that we\u2019re pursuing will be used \u2013 will be done through the lens of improving our financial wherewithal with the expectations that there will be a downturn in the future. Fortunately for MGM, we\u2019re far better prepared today than we were before the last downturn. We have no major capital projects underway; we have no major developments that are being built, we know what our CapEx is going to be in \u201819, \u201820, \u201821, \u201822. We know we can manage that CapEx very specifically. We know we\u2019re more diversified now than we were a decade ago. We know that because of MGM 2020, we\u2019re more nimble. We\u2019re more able to react to economic changes or even regional changes, let alone global changes.","And so when we think about what do we do with the owned assets, we do with our assets that are part of MGP, our operating units there. We also are really proud of the MGP team. They, too, have been busy, they\u2019ve been very focused, they have been very, I think, disciplined in terms of acquiring assets accretively, but acquiring quality assets because not all assets are equal. And certainly not all assets are equal when you\u2019re in the later stages of a cycle. And certainly all assets are not equal if you\u2019re in a downturn.","MGM Growth Properties and MGM Resorts owns only Class A real estate. It doesn\u2019t own Class B classy real estate. And in more mature areas of real estate, that\u2019s well known to investors. And they value real estate in office, in commercial, residential, retail differently depending upon the quality of the asset. In the gaming space, that hasn\u2019t happened yet. But it will. It will happen in our view, because quality counts. We saw that during the last downturn in markets where we had the market leadership position whether it be Borgata in Atlantic City or Detroit where one property went bankrupt in Detroit, but not MGM Grand Detroit. And so we are viewing all of this through the lens of improving our financial wherewithal, our financial stability and we understand fully our obligations as the capital provider to our resorts. We just feel that we\u2019re just getting going in terms of how we can best maximize the value for all the shareholders, MGM Resorts, what we own, including our OP units in MGM Growth Properties.","David Katz","And as my follow up, I just wanted to go back again to one of the other topics since [indiscernible]. I might be close to last. On the subject of M&A, I just wanted to be clear about what the boundaries are. I think the general expectation is that the focus is much more inward and on what you have on your plate. But could there be sets \u2013 some set of circumstances or some opportunity that\u2019s too attractive to pass up, where you would meaningfully pursue acquiring a property of some size?","James Murren","It would be hard for me to foresee and certainly not something we\u2019re pursuing. We did look at a property that you\u2019re well aware of earlier this year. We were presented with that as something that we should or would take a look at, and we did. It\u2019s a high quality asset in a major city, where MGM already has a very strong brand affinity. And so we looked at it, and of course, we end up passing on that opportunity. But it wasn\u2019t something, and nor is anything else something we\u2019re actively pursuing. As I said earlier, we like what we have. And we don\u2019t need to own any assets anywhere in the United States to maximize what we believe is our sports betting opportunity. And so therefore, the only reason why we would look at something is whether or not we believe it will have an outsized return on investment and fits within our capital allocation strategies. And I think Empire City is a very good example of that. Certainly, we believe that there is a vast opportunity over time with Empire City as we can diversify that into a broad-based resort. And so I hope that answers the question.","David Katz","The answers are perfectly clear, not just for my questions, but frankly, all of them today.","James Murren","Thank you. And I want to thank you all for joining us today. I hope you found it informative. Just want to recap on a couple of things, one is we are satisfied with the second quarter. We\u2019re really very pleased with how balanced the property performance has been, both throughout the United States and over in Macau. We are incredibly proud of the men and women here at MGM Resorts that have implemented to date our MGM 2020 Plan. It has been a tremendous amount of work which is bearing fruit as we speak. And you\u2019ll see the benefits as that accelerate throughout the balance of this year and into next year. We\u2019re pleased that Las Vegas is doing as well from a macro perspective as it is, and it sets up for really a positive performance for the entire market in 2020. And as I said, now that we have a half year under our belt, we are confident that we\u2019re going to hit our 2020 financial targets, that $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion of consolidated EBITDA, our free cash flow per share of $3.50 while running a conservative capital allocation strategy that targets that leverage between 3 and 4x while we increase our dividend and return shares, buybacks to our shareholders. With that, as always, Cathy, Aaron, Corey, myself, Bill, we\u2019re always around for any questions you have. And thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","And thank you, sir.

After the company\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D\u2019Arrigo. You may begin your conference.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","","Thank you, Rasiya (ph), and good morning, and welcome to MGM Resorts International fourth quarter and full year earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and a replay of the call will be made available on the company\u2019s website. This morning, we furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC. And before we get started, I\u2019d like to read our quick Safe Harbor disclosures.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Federal Securities Law, actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today\u2019s press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Q filings.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website.","Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Murren","Well. Thank you, Dan, and good morning to everyone. 2011 was a rewarding year for MGM. Our net revenues and EBITDA were both up double digits and our margins were up over 100 basis points. MGM China and CityCenter had breakout years, both had significant growth and EBITDA year-over-year and we ended the year on a high note with fourth quarter RevPAR up 13% year-over-year. As a matter of fact, we beat our RevPAR guidance every quarter last year and that was driven by better than expected FIT and leisure bookings. EBITDA for the wholly owned MGM China and CityCenter enterprises were all up double digits in the fourth quarter.","Looking back on the year, I\u2019d like to take a moment to highlight a few of the major accomplishments before we move forward. Over at CityCenter, we refinanced $2 billion of debt and we\u2019ve already been in the market again this year partially refinancing it yet again at better rates. Of course at MGM China, we listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at the same time MGM Resorts acquired 1% of the stock and consolidated therefore MGM China on to its balance sheet and financial statements that of course significantly improves our financial standing.","At the same time, we sold $300 million of convertible note to our partner Pansy Ho. Over on the online side, we partnered with Bwin.Party in what we believe to be a very important strategic franchise and this will jointly offer online poker in U.S. if it\u2019s legalized and at M Life, we launched the addition of all of our non-gaming capabilities, both starting last year and with great progress here in 2012. And speaking of 2012, we\u2019re off to a very, very solid start. I\u2019m happy to say that we\u2019re executing on many of the goals that we\u2019ve set out to accomplish. We\u2019ve been very busy even in the beginning of this year and improving our balance sheet and I know Dan is going to go into further detail on some of those steps in a moment. We have made that a priority, I\u2019ve mentioned this before, but it\u2019s my belief that as we improve the balance sheet of this company, and it\u2019s a promise I made to the Board, we will be accruing great value to the owners of the company, the shareholders and that has been our goal and we\u2019ve made much progress there.","Just last week, we officially launched M Life\u2019s non-gaming program. We\u2019re excited about this given the nature of our resorts because this will allow our customers to be rewarded for everything that they do with us, every dollar virtually they spend in our resorts, hotel, restaurants, entertainment attractions, spas, you name it. And in conjunction with that, we launched our new website mlife.com, which is working out extraordinarily well and makes the booking experience for our resorts, not only more fun, but certainly more productive for us as people can literally crap their own vocations, bundling all their opportunities into one trip.","It\u2019s a big step in driving casino play, in casino mix into particularly our Las Vegas properties, we know how valuable this can be to cash flows and to flow through and we think we\u2019ll be able to report on a quarterly basis great strides in that area.","On the operations side, we announced only a week or two ago a strategic relationship with Meristar. We\u2019re excited about this, I know they\u2019re as well because it will not only create an opportunity to extend our reach into the regional markets, but will significantly expand we believe the benefits of their assets we have here in Las Vegas, increasing again casino mix, which we believe will lead to a greater profitability. We have a variety of these type of relationships underway probably more to report in the coming quarters and we believe that that\u2019s a great way to leverage our assets, improve our cash flows in a very capital light fashion.","We\u2019re making a name for ourselves in Massachusetts. We think that\u2019s a great potential market for us. We certainly are trying to stake our position there, and we\u2019re looking at variety of other regional markets, where we can invest small sums or partner with others to again increase the network that MGM Resorts can accomplish in across marketing basis to Las Vegas.","Part of that goal is on our Hospitality division run by Gamal Aziz, that\u2019s a big part of how we believe we can leverage our brands around the world, Just yesterday we made an announcement that MGM Hospitality with our partner Diaoyutai will develop and manage a hotel right on the Bund in Shanghai. It\u2019s a tremendous location. It\u2019ll be called Bellagio and imagine to having a Bellagio on the Bund in Shanghai, that will join the MGM Grand that just opened in Hainan Island in the town of Sanya, and those two properties will be joined by two others that opened just this year, we have opening in Beijing and another in the large city of Chengdu and these are about four of about a dozen or so projects we have underway in China. This online poker initiative is important Bwin.Party is expert in this space. The relationship we formed means that MGM will own 25% of this joint venture that will hold rights, exclusive rights to Bwin.Party\u2019s existing brands for online wagering here in the United States.","In addition and at the same time, we entered into an agreement with Bwin.Party to use their software and technical expertise to deliver any of our brands, the MGM brands to the public under which we would pay them a fee. We therefore believe we are as well positioned as any should the U.S. market come online on a legalized fashion for poker, which we expect it will, we\u2019ll be out of the gate as soon as anybody.","And so with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan to get into our operating results.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Thank you, Jim. First, I\u2019d like to give few highlights from the quarter, help you with some guidance on some items for your models and then provide you an update on our balance sheet.","As far as the quarter on the EBITDA margin side, we\u2019ve increased our wholly-owned domestic property EBITDA margins every quarter this year and in fact the fourth quarter that represented the largest year-over-year improvement in the year of some 200 basis points. We continue to remain focused on managing our expenses while maximizing revenue allowing us to achieve approximately 48% flow through to the EBITDA and profitability line in the quarter.","Our convention trends remained strong during the fourth quarter; in fact Mandalay Bay increased its EBITDA by 40% year-over-year and primarily to better convention mix in the quarter. We finished 2011 with our wholly-owned strip convention mix at about 14.7% which was higher than our expectations coming into the year driven by significant amount of the in the year, for the year bookings.","On the room trend side the operating teams continue to do a tremendous job here, our leisure and FIT rates have been the biggest driver of the upside to our RevPAR gains in the year, these segments in terms of our overall retail segments here are up 9% in the fourth quarter. Our casino trends continue to improve; our international volumes continue to be strong. Over the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve seen a pickup in our domestic play. Fourth quarter domestic rated table games play increased again year-over-year and during the fourth quarter our wholly-owned property has experienced increases in both volume and win in both table games and slots something we haven\u2019t seen since the fourth quarter of 2011.","Our regional resorts continue to do well. Our regional property showed continued strength with combined EBITDA up 12% year-over-year and we\u2019re proud to report that MGM Detroit had its best fourth quarter ever and in fact that put an exclamation point on its best year ever in 2011 and a great job by George Corchis and Steve Zanella in that marketplace.","Our CapEx in the fourth quarter was $113 million excluding $12 million in MGM China and our full year 2011 was approximately $274 million excluding about $27 million at MGM China, since we began consolidating them.","In 2012, we expect to spend approximately $350 million in capital excluding MGM China and Grant will touch on his expectations there for 2012 and included in those capital plans for this year is the continuation of the room remodel project in MGM Grand. The room remodel at the Spa Tower; later on this year here at Bellagio. The conversion and investment in the Michael Jackson show with Cirque du Soleil at Mandalay coming online late 2012, early 2013 and the Blue Man Group show at Monte Carlo coming on this year.","In Q4 you all have noticed that our corporate expense is higher than usual in the quarter, we had some one-time items in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to some transition costs and outsourcing some of our IT functions, some marketing development expenses and we had some credits in the prior year 2010 quarter related to property taxes, so it made for an unfavorable comparison.","Going forward though we expect our corporate expense to moderate and be in the mid-30-ish million area in the first quarter before stock compensation expense. Our stock compensation expense in the first quarter is estimated to be approximately $10 million. Our depreciation expense in the quarter, we estimate to be approximately $235 million to $240 million and our interest expense in the fourth quarter was $274 million, including approximately $6 million from MGM China and about $24 million in amortization expense.","We estimate that our interest expense in the first quarter would be approximately $285 million, including at roughly about the same amount of $6 million from MGM China and about the same amount of $24 million in amortization expense. As Jim mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve had a busy start to the year and have already achieved some major accomplishments in improving our balance sheet.","I\u2019ll start first over at CityCenter, where we added on to our first lien notes by some $240 million a few weeks back. This lowered our interest rate and extended our maturities by a year at CityCenter. There remains about $75 million outstanding under the current first lien term loan and we\u2019ve received commitment to replace that term loan with a revolver for the same amount and we expect that to be finalized in the upcoming weeks.","On the MGM Resorts side, we completed a successful and very well subscribed bond offering, which is upsized from $500 million to $850 million that was something three times oversubscribed and we achieved a rate of the 8 and 5.8s which is the lowest unsecured rate we\u2019ve achieved since before the economic downturn.","And as we pointed out in the release, we\u2019ve received preliminary approval from roughly 62% of the lenders on our Amendment and Extension transaction of our credit facility. We expect the closing of that to be later this week, early next. And we expect to initially achieve roughly about 150 basis points in rate improvement on the extending portion of that facility.","As a remainder, our average barrowing cost is on an outstanding debt is approximately 8%, so for every 1% improvement in rate that we can achieve, that\u2019s an incremental $125 million in interest rate and incremental free cash flow to our company. So, as we go forward we believe there will be more opportunities to further reduce these borrowing costs and improve our overall free cash flow.","And with that I\u2019d turn it over to Bobby Baldwin to talk about CityCenter.","Bobby Baldwin","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We had a great year at CityCenter with EBITDA from operations up to $236 million and we ended year on a strong note with EBITDA in the fourth quarter up 62%. Aria\u2019s 2011, EBITDA improvement is attributable to significant growth in volume and revenue across all key operating divisions.","Casino revenues increased 27% year-over-year and hotel revenues increased 24%. Aria ended the year strong with fourth quarter EBITDA of $47 million. Our slot revenue for the quarter was the highest since opening that property, a 21% increase from last year and we continue to be one of the market leaders in table games as well.","Aria benefited by approximately 6 million due to slightly higher table games full whole percentage in the fourth quarter compared to previous year. Aria\u2019s fourth quarter hotel revenue improvements were driven by a 10% growth in RevPAR, it is significant to know that this growth was achieved by improving our convention segment with a 20% growth in occupied convention room nights and a 9% higher ADR versus last year.","Aria continued to develop as one of the top convention destinations in the country. For 2012, we have over 100% of our planned convention room nights already booked. Aria\u2019s leisure segment business is also improving; our production numbers in domestic leisure are on par with Bellagio\u2019s as awareness in United States continues to build. We are making progress in the international leisure market as well and see an opportunity for further improvements in that market. We are currently in negotiation with Cirque du Soleil to have the Albert show replaced at the end of this year. We\u2019re very excited about offering a new show to our guests and I expect the unveiling to be a significant boost to business volumes throughout the entire resort. We\u2019re in the process of updating some of our dining options. The restaurant union has been closed and will be replaced with a high energy fun, casual Mexican restaurant Javier\u2019s, which is extremely popular in the Southern California market.","We\u2019re also evaluating our other dining options for opportunities to include additional recognizable brands to Aria. We look forward to hosting the annual Michael Jordan Celebrity Golf Invitational again this year at Aria in Shadow Creek and it\u2019s in the last weekend of March. Vdara was able to grow both rate and occupancy in 2011, while also adding additional 131,000 available room nights to its inventory. Vdara had its best quarter yet, in the fourth quarter and continues to gain momentum as the best non-gaming, non-smoking resort in Las Vegas.","Crystal same store sales were up 24% year-over-year during the fourth quarter and we now are approximately 86% leased. Both Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s women\u2019s and men\u2019s stores have opened this year and these are our two flagship locations for Dolce & Gabbana. Eres a store featuring Chanel\u2019s swimwear and lingerie is scheduled to open during the second quarter of this year.","Finally our residential strategy of leasing unsold units continues to be successful. To-date, we\u2019ve leased 405 units of CityCenter with totally monthly lease revenues of $751,000.","Well, that concludes my report and I\u2019ll turn it over to Grant Bowie. Grant?","Grant Bowie","Thank you, Baldwin and good morning and with guys there in Asia a very early morning. We\u2019re very happy here at MGM China, to be with you today and we\u2019re very pleased also with the progress we\u2019re making and developing our business. For the fourth quarter net revenues for MGM China were $719 million, that\u2019s up 26% year-on-year. EBITDA reached to new record of $174 million, an increase of 23% year-on-year.","During the fourth quarter we are able to drive significant growth from each of our revenue segments. In our VIP business, rolling chip volume grew by 29% with growth coming from increased volumes from our existing operators as well as being able to add two additional and new operators. We\u2019ve also had benefited from VIP hold at 3.2% during the quarter.","On the main floor table drop was up 13% and slot handle up 35%. The success on the main floor was a result of the launch of our Supreme Lounge in light December 2010 and the subsequent opening of our new Platinum Lounge at the end of the third quarter, 2011 both of which have catered into our premium main floor customers. The environment and enhanced services have being well received by the customers and had the effect of increasing both win per unit and overall platter traffic.","Continued development of our targeted customer communications and entertainment also resulted in our record daily visit account in December and allowed us to set a new record for our slot revenue in December.","Our focus on our customer relationship building across all segments continues to improve revenues and it\u2019s the core strategy to drive our future revenue growth. We also have continued to make operational improvements and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re still able to drive additional earnings growth from that business.","We opened our new MGM VIP in-house area in mid-December and while it\u2019s still very early we have seen initially strong increases in volume. We continued to reinvest in Macau and at MGM Macau CapEx was $45 million in 2011 and will be approximately $80 million in 2012. Of this $45 million is allocated to build out the undeveloped space on our second floor with the balance being applied to rejuvenating capital works.","In Cotai, we\u2019re well positioned and had plans for a truly unique MGM experience. Our plan is to have approximately 500 tables, two and a half thousand slots, 1,600 rooms and at the moment is budgeted to be approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion to be spend over a timeframe of approximately 36 months. At the end of the fourth quarter MGM China had approximately $720 million in cash, debt of $552 million and an adjusted leverage ratio of less than one time based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA.","Earlier today the MGM China Board approved a special dividend in the amount of approximately $400 million to shareholders on record on March the 9th. We\u2019re pleased that our improving cash flows has afforded us the ability to return cash to the shareholders. Our Board will continually review opportunities for the use of cash and going forward we will manage our growth and expansion prospects with our desire to return cash to our shareholders.","With that I\u2019d like to turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Murren","Well, thank you, Grant and thanks for being up so late or early depending on your perspective. We feel extraordinarily proud of last year\u2019s results, but I guess the real motion is how optimistic we are about the future and I think we have some reason to be. We\u2019re off to a very good start here in 2012, both in Las Vegas and in Macau. The tone of the business here this year is quite positive.","Grant has done a tremendous job in Macau in general and specifically to expand our resort there, the MGM. And we are very excited about Cotai. We\u2019re excited we have a company that has the ability to generate significant cash there to reinvest into Macau and at the same time return a great value to the shareholders. Both markets are growing, certainly Macau is, but now so is Las Vegas and I\u2019m pleased to say that MGM is building its market share in those markets.","Grant mentioned what we\u2019re doing in Macau and here in Las Vegas in addition to what we did last year. We\u2019ll keep this momentum going. Just over the New Year\u2019s eve weekend, we opened up two major night clubs, One Oak over at Mirage and Hide here at Bellagio and they\u2019re doing tremendously well from the P&L perspective and adding a lot of energy, driving a lot revenue to the properties. And early this month, we opened up Lilly, another lounge here at Bellagio and we have plans to open a Hakkasan, Hakkasan is going to spend a tremendous amount of money at the MGM to replace Studio 54 that\u2019s been there for over 10 years.","These major upgrades to the physical facilities have been matched by major upgrades to our rooms, so the room remodel program here has added tremendously to the ADR at Bellagio and we\u2019re seeing great early returns on much higher ADR to MGM as we renovate those rooms as well.","And we\u2019re driving people here to Las Vegas by being very strategic and aggressive on our event calendar. We mentioned last year how strong the event calendar looked the MGM Grand Garden Arena and the Mandalay Event Center and I\u2019m happy to say it\u2019s even better this year.","Just to mention a few coming up we have Floyd Mayweather fighting in May at the MGM and then Manny Pacquiao the next month in June. Madonna is coming back, she\u2019s going to be here in October and we have several of these type of events throughout the year, which we know has a material impact on ADR and casino revenue.","On the ADR side we mentioned this a few times last year, we said the first quarter would be the toughest comp because there was a big, big convention here last year and we have to overcome that but even still because of recent bookings we believe our RevPAR will be up in the first quarter, up a couple of percent to 3% but growing, in fact the second quarter looks particularly strong.","We think our RevPAR is going to grow nicely throughout the year, even on top of the good growth that we had in 2011. This is based on the booking trends that we see. We\u2019re seeing very strong pace throughout the year and our convention base is extremely solid and when you combine that to the growing FIT and leisure bookings, we\u2019re seeing a broad based retail improvement in rooms revenue.","Las Vegas has clearly regained its position as the place to be and looking at this year just alone, to give a sense of it, we had records or near records in almost every event that we\u2019ve had already this year. The Super Bowl was tremendously effective for the town and for us or half the town in terms of revenue in the Super Bowl.","Chinese New Year\u2019s was outstanding. We just finished up President\u2019s Weekend. It was up nicely versus last year and of course the March Madness coming in next month.","So the combination of an improving market here in Las Vegas and certainly in Macau, strategic investments into our properties to make our properties ever more exciting, the addition of M Life which is driving casino play and overall spend to our properties and a very robust event calendar bodes very, very well for Las Vegas and more particularly MGM, bodes well for Macau and particularly MGM China.","And with that I think I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator and we can get to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix.","Felicia Hendrix","Jim, just to pack on to your final commentary on RevPAR, thank you for some of the quarterly color. Just wondering when you think about the RevPAR for full the year of 2012, do you think that you can achieve mid to high single digit growth there?","Jim Murren","I think that\u2019s very reasonable.","Felicia Hendrix","And then just a little bit of housekeeping on Rev. Can you just give us what the change in cash ADR was in the quarter and then also your RevPAR increase. It's still kind of like the last quarter, it\u2019s comping against not apples to apples with the Resorts fees. Do you know what your RevPAR increase would have been if you adjusted for the resort fee?","Jim Murren","Well, we\u2019ll look at the cash number in a second. The Resorts fee helped us in the fourth quarter by couple of percent but we\u2019ve largely anniversaried all of that. So, RevPAR guidance going forward will not have any or very little impact on Resort fee.","Corey Sanders","","Felicia, it still would have been up little over 10% excluding resort fee.","Jim Murren","In the fourth quarter, right.","Corey Sanders","","In the fourth quarter.","Jim Murren","Yes, it\u2019s 8.6% in the fourth quarter, 11% for the year.","Felicia Hendrix","What was that?","Jim Murren","Go ahead, Corey.","Corey Sanders","","8.6% for the fourth quarter, 11% for the year.","Felicia Hendrix","And then, you guys certainly had good results. Just a few properties I was wondering if I could get some clarification on. MGM Grand margins were flat year-over-year. Wondering if that had to do with some construction disruption yet the hotel statistics were a lot stronger. So I'm assuming that that\u2019s just because you had rooms out of service. Mirage was lower year-over-year. Also anything specific going on there? And then Bellagio, did you guys just have a great quarter, Bellagio, was there some hold there?","Jim Murren","The Mirage hold was down year-over-year. We did have disruption at the MGM.","Bobby Baldwin","And Bellagio was up (inaudible) whole percentage, but really Bellagio across all its rooms, food, beverage, entertainment segments, it\u2019s really been improving all year along but their hold was up year-over-year as well.","Jim Murren","Their hold was up, but their non-gaming revenues and profits were up significantly.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you. And then on just moving to Grant, obviously you\u2019ve continued to improve the properties. It certainly shows in your numbers. I\u2019m just wondering if you could walk us through what your expectations for the property are when Sands Cotai Central opens and then also what do you expect to happen to the promotional environment in Macau when Sands Cotai opens. Thanks.","Jim Murren","So Grant, we\u2019ll turn now it over to you.","Grant Bowie","","I think the (inaudible) Sands Cotai Central is predictable. And I think that as we\u2019ve seen before, we will be able to sustain and maintain our position and will continue to do it as we keep on executing on our strategies. I think the interesting observation is going to be, how the other Cotai properties handle that expansion.","So I think for us on the peninsula, we\u2019re now used to Cotai properties opening. I think we all know what we have to do and I just reiterate the point that we\u2019ve always stayed close to our customers. We want to build a strong relationship and that tends to allow us to hold. Clearly, we would expect that they\u2019ll go and try the new place but as we\u2019ve seen with COD, Galaxy, they\u2019ve come back to us and that\u2019s always what we want to focus on. And what was your second?","Felicia Hendrix","You answered both parts. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis.","Harry Curtis","A quick question on your flow through. So it was a little bit softer in the fourth quarter than it had been in the second and third quarter. And if you could explain what segments really held it back, were there any onetime items that could explain that and as the year goes on, do you expect the flow through to improve?","Jim Murren","Yes, Harry, as it relates to the flow through, I think if you look the seasonality in the business, the fourth quarter flow through is never and never has been this great in the first quarter when you\u2019re looking at the sequential improvement from that standpoint. 48% flow through in the quarter is one of the highest levels in any of our fourth quarters and even in fact higher than '06 levels.","So when you look at the factors that go into that, one of the big key factors is our occupied room nights which are always lower in the fourth quarter than say the third quarter. And as you know that\u2019s a big driver of some of the incidental or other revenues, food, beverage, entertainment, some of the high profit margin areas as well.","So I think the fourth quarter is a great flow through in terms of comparison. I think the sequential piece is a little bit of an apple to an orange comparison, but the overall fourth quarter was pretty strong in terms of flow through, when you look at the seasonality aspects.","Harry Curtis","So you would expect it to be higher for the year.","Bobby Baldwin","For the year. Yes, I think for the year we have been higher. We\u2019re up over a 50% for the overall year in 2011 and I think it\u2019s a good way to kind of model the incremental flow through going forward.","Harry Curtis","That\u2019s great. And then, Jim, a quick question on Internet poker. Nothing was attached to the tax bill. Can you give us your sense of where it goes at the federal level from here?","Jim Murren","Sure. I think that there are several options in front of Congress in terms of getting Internet poker passed at the federal level this year. Several pieces of legislation need to be passed and it could be associated with anyone of those on.","It\u2019s hard to say exactly when or if. I do believe it will be passed at the federal level, and I do believe it will be passed this year, but that\u2019s my opinion and one that\u2019s shared by a lot of people that are close to this.","At a parallel though, as you know, states are fervently working on their own legislation and can do so and will do so if the federal government does not act. States can compact with one another, forming a intra-state network of internet poker and we would certainly be involved in that.","We\u2019re prepared. In fact our arrangement with Bwin.Party is designed to capitalize on Internet poker legalized in U.S. in either fashion, either statewide or federally.","We actually prefer the federal option for any number of reasons, uniformity of regulation, taxation, strengthening of client prevention, but we can't speak for the federal government. It seems sometimes they can\u2019t speak for themselves.","So I think that it will happen at the federal level. It\u2019s not easy, not because Internet poker is becoming a complicated issue. It\u2019s becoming a more clear issue today. It\u2019s because Washington has become more complicated. If it doesn\u2019t happen at federal level, it will happen at the state level and either way it I think it happens this year in 2012 and I would have to say that we\u2019ll be literally one of the first towards this out of the gate when it is approved.","Harry Curtis","Just a quick follow-up. Does Senator Kyl's influence in your view extend into the House or maybe a different question; do you have any champions for federal approval in the House?","Jim Murren","Well, the CEO doesn\u2019t opine on politics like others. So I feel like I'm going to stick to the gaming industry that I am involved in but I do believe that there is broad based support in the Republican and Democratic side, in now both the Senate and in the House.","I think that the House, from what I\u2019ve been let to believe, really views this as a very critical law enforcement issue, very critical. They recognize that the DOJ\u2019s interpretation of the Wire Act leaves open the opportunity for state-by-state gaming where they will not have an influence on the regulatory compliance. That deeply concerns many people in the House and I think that is the big change between 2012 and 2011 and I think that\u2019s the change that gets it over the finish line.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent.","Steven Kent","Just a couple of questions. First Dan, could you just talk about broadly ways or additional levers you have to reduce leverage in '12 and into 2013. I realize that you guys have done an incredible job over the past couple of years but are there significant opportunities over the next two years that we should be looking for that might just actually get that leverage down completely or more substantially.","And then separately, just on the leisure consumer, can you just tell us a sense of what you are seeing from them? It sounds like your convention business is very good. On the non-convention nights, especially mid-week, are you able to fill the rooms? It looks like that from RevPAR perspective, but are you able to get them to spend money, are they spending more money in restaurants, in the casino? Just some color on that would be helpful.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Sure, Steve. This is Dan. I\u2019ll tackle the first and then I'm sure Jim and Corey will jump in on the second. As far as the additional lever, obviously as our properties continue to improve and recover, this becomes more and more a free cash flow story as we go forward and improve from an operation standpoint.","We still have roughly about $180 million sitting in a trust account in New Jersey and are continuing to work through that process and are working on the other sale of our interest in Borgata as well on top of that 180. So that\u2019s clearly another lever that will go to reduce debt and provide that additional lever.","When we look out to the future, and I can\u2019t speak for our joint venture Boards, particularly MGM China, but clearly the announcement today by the China Board is a productive one from a shareholder and MGM Resorts standpoint and I think that\u2019s something that that Board will look at from time to time and explore returning capital to shareholders in addition to the growth initiatives that they have in Macau and perhaps Taiwan in the future.","So I think when you look at the levers, we\u2019re going to continue to obviously be opportunistic in the markets as well. I think no one is as equipped. We\u2019ve got some of the best accounting and finance and legal teams internally here to access the markets quickly and opportunistically and I think that gives us a lot of levers to push and pull on over the upcoming quarters.","Jim Murren","","Let me just add to that Dan if I could. I\u2019d focus on the cash flow because we know what our CapEx plans will be over the next several years and we believe that these capital expenditures will yield good ROIs. These are projects that are enhancing already existing buildings. There is no new build in here, there is not a lot of Greenfield construction. This is generating very healthy returns right away. Bellagio\u2019s room remodel will be an easy example of that.","So limited and known fixed CapEx with high returns, driving revenues in a variety of ways. The big driver of debt reduction will be on the cash flow side and that\u2019s going to be growing in our opinion yearly.","Dan mentioned Borgata. That\u2019s certainly to not only the money we have trapped there, but our 50% interest and of course Macau, which Dan mentioned. I\u2019d also throw CityCenter into that dialogue, CityCenter is a deleveraging enterprise and its goal is to return value to its shareholders, Infinity World and MGM Resorts and through the residential inventory that we own and through the rising cash flows we think that CityCenter will be deleveraging and be a source of cash to the partners.","So a variety of levers that we have, what\u2019s not on the list is our asset sales. That\u2019s opportunistic and happens occasionally. We\u2019ve done it before but it\u2019s unlikely that we would sell any of our operating assets. We feel like they can generate a lot of money for us as the markets improve, and they\u2019re certainly already starting to improve. So that was on the table a few years ago, it\u2019s not now.","On the second part of your question, I think it was on the leisure side, was it not, Corey? That\u2019s a particularly bright story for us. I'm looking at something that happened last week. It\u2019s the most retail bookings that we booked just last week for example, in the last five years. And the week before that, as I look at it was the third highest that we\u2019ve had in the last five years.","And in fact if you look at all the bookings this year, this schedules yes, this is correct, it was good. We are having new records of top 20 booking weeks in every single week. So this momentum, why we're so confident that 2012 is improving is the leisure bookings that are occurring right now for this year are new records and certainly kinds of numbers we haven\u2019t seen in half a decade.","And then of course on the international side, which is particularly important to us, I think for Las Vegas it\u2019s about 18% of visitations. Is that right?","So it's higher for us given the nature of our resorts and that traffic is improving and of course Mccarran Airport is expanding, international carriers are adding flights to Las Vegas and that really plays right to our strength.","So I would say on the retail side, in general if you look at our FIT business, our international business, leisure picking up substantially, convention business, we'll have another very good year in 2012. That all conspires to have a very strong year on the room side.","Corey Sanders","","And I would add the international customer stays longer time and they spend money. So although they fall in that leisure bucket, they are very much like an FIT customer. So we\u2019ve seen uplift in our slot play and our prime dining. Our ADR in that segment is up over 10%. So it\u2019s been a great segment for us this year.","Jim Murren","That\u2019s a good point Corey.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Strawn from Morgan Stanley.","Mark Strawn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Can you give us a sense or some color on how you expect your group rates to trend in Las Vegas in 2012 within the context of a rough guidance you gave and not to get too far ahead of ourselves, but would you expect those rates to step up meaningfully in 2013 as maybe some of the lower rated group business you booked during the downturn starts to almost completely burn off as we turn the calendar into '13?","Jim Murren","You are talking about convention business right, not leisure business?","Mark Strawn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Corey Sanders","I think Mark, as Jim pointed out earlier, I mean obviously the first quarter has a tough comp. We see the second quarter improving and the back half of the year is also holding up well. There is still more work to do obviously this year. I think we were projecting for '12 kind of the same convention room mix as we kind of finished up 2011 with.","And I think what it will come down to is in the year for the year bookings which in '11 were exceptionally strong and if we can come anywhere close to that, we think we can drive better rates in '12 than '11. '13 and '14 pace right now looks exceptionally strong, both in terms of rate and room nights booked and we still have more work to do there as well but we're gratified by what we see this early on and '13 and '14 looks very strong.","And I think the same bodes for Aria as well there. Their convention bookings as Bobby mentioned, our goal coming into any given year is about having 80% of what we want in convention room nights contracted on the books and as Bobby mentioned earlier for 2012, Aria is already at a 100% of that goal in terms of contracted room nights in '12 and '13. It's getting even stronger every day.","Mark Strawn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Is it fair to characterize that in the group business you\u2019re bookings stay more, let\u2019s say in the last year or so in booking orders. You would say it is easier to push rate gains and have stronger contracts in place than may be a couple of years back?","Jim Murren","Yes, there is no doubt about that, Mark. Our mix ended up higher in 2011 than we thought and even still, it looks like our mix would be flat to up a little bit, but at higher rates, is the important thing and better still in 2013 because many of these conventions are two to three year conventions.","We were booking conventions in 2008, 2009 with modest annual escalators. They\u2019re burning off right now. So the conventions that we\u2019re booking today and the ones that we booked last year are at much higher rates.","So not only is our mix improving, but the ADR rate we\u2019re getting for those conventions is improving and the overall spend is going up because the portfolio spend is higher. They have more fun they\u2019re here, they\u2019re booking out restaurants, they\u2019re booking out the beach at Mandalay, they\u2019re having more special events and the delegations have gone up. So attrition levels have gone down, attendance has gone up. CES is a good example. It just happened this year, all time record for the town, all-time record for us. Want to add anything to that Corey?","Corey Sanders","","No, I think the other positive side we\u2019re seeing, as Jim said we are seeing multiple year bookings and we\u2019re actually happy to turn away certain bookings because of space limitations, which we haven\u2019t seen in a few years. So all in all it\u2019s a positive story on the convention sides.","And Aria being the only gold, lead gold, it's a good fit, I know Bobby wishes we had a couple of hundred thousand square feet more and we\u2019re already sold out for Aria and that creates a lot of rate opportunity. We've obviously being driving right at Aria.","Bobby Baldwin","","And 2013 rate is strong and 2014 will be strong or so.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America","Most of my questions have been answered, but I did want to follow up on, one, I think Jim you had mentioned a little bit strategically about some of the management fees and some of the hotel deals you're signing. That line item actually was around breakeven or so this year, at least according to my model. So kind of wondering how do you see that ramping as some of these new properties open up and when can you start to get some meaningful earnings contribution from that line.","Jim Murren","Well, it is. We started first in China. Shaun we started that company way back in 2007. It takes a while to do these things. I know that some of our competitors dipping their toe in the water right now, but they're years behind us. And just in that one enterprise alone, we have in China, about 12 different deals under various forms of development. Some of them take quite a while.","So we\u2019re already starting to make money in China now. The joint venture is, because we opened in Sanya over Chinese New Year's as an example. That hotel, the MGM Grand was getting over a $1,000 a night in ADR and that\u2019s an hour flight by the way to Hong Kong and to Macau. So the cross marketing of having an MGM Grand in the Huawei of China touching our customers is very, very valuable.","So I think that that company is growing and will grow in terms of cash flows, not only in China, but around the world. Remember also that in that line item we have Branco (ph) which is MGM China\u2019s Branco (ph) and that steps up from, remember it was only half year last year, it was $15 million. This year it will be a $30 million number here in 2012.","So Branco (ph) which is the company that has for a fee lent the name to MGM China goes in cash flow from $15 million last year to $30 million this year. That helps an awful lot.","So a combination of these hotel management deals, development fees, Branco (ph) has had a big impact on improving the cash flows and I think it\u2019s going to grow into quite a large company over the next several years. Dan, did you want to add something.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yes. And I think the other thing to point out is with these brands and these flags, particularly in Asia, we\u2019re going to get to know a lot of customers that we don\u2019t even know exist. So the cross marketing opportunities into Las Vegas and Macau, we\u2019re not going to quantify or even attempt to do that at this stage of the game but that is an opportunity and we think it could pay some significant dividends to both Macau and Las Vegas.","Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America","And then just one more on Las Vegas to follow up on some of the prior questions, I was wondering if you guys think about the mid-single digit to high-single digit kind of RevPAR expectation for '12, some of your competitors have been, I\u2019d say a little bit more cautious, particularly around maybe in the third quarter and just kind of wondering, obviously your portfolio stands a much broader set of customers but do you see kind of low-end outperforming high-end or where are you having the most success in kind of pushing rates and building occupancies at this point in the recovery?","Jim Murren","Well, you\u2019re right. We do have a vast portfolio in every price point and the core properties are doing particularly well, there is no doubt about that. But I wouldn\u2019t ignore the luxury properties. I am not sure what the competitors are saying but we\u2019re going to do well, we believe in RevPAR at the luxury properties. The room remodel program only finished at the end of last year at Bellagio, so we get a full year benefit of that. That\u2019s going to have material impact on RevPAR at Bellagio.","The MGM Grand remodel program improves that RevPAR throughout the year, that major remodel is done in September I think of this year. It started last September. And we\u2019re seeing the convention business, and the events calendar so robust at Mandalay Bay, we saw Mandalay Bay did well in the fourth quarter. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity at Mandalay Bay and Mirage as well.","So my guess is that you\u2019ll see strong RevPAR throughout the portfolio. We certainly are able to drive great RevPAR growth at our core properties as the luxury portfolio in general in town, ours and our competitors improves and they fell the most. So there is an opportunity there.","I think the combination of M Life, our events, the capital that we spent last year and spending this year and being pretty aggressive in the marketplace, we\u2019ve added a lot of people on the convention sales side, the leisure sales side, yielding more affectively. All will combine to get very good and growing RevPAR this year.","Bobby Baldwin","And of course, Jim, there is no added first class room inventory on the horizon in Las Vegas for quite some time.","Jim Murren","","Good point. Operator, I think we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan.","Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan","Looking back at last year in Las Vegas, your hotel revenue growth led the enterprise revenue growth. As you look into 2012 and given your comments about the goods things that you\u2019re going with M Life, the event calendar was on the books for group and the comparison, do you think the non-room revenue growth exceeds the room revenue growth in 2012?","Jim Murren","The revenue growth particularly on the convention side led this recovery, Joe. And the other aspects of our business are catching up. And so I think we\u2019re going to have a good year on the convention side but if the early numbers here in 2012 are any indicator, gaming is coming back in Las Vegas.","Our table play is improving nationally and internationally. Our slot business has been really very strong and that bodes well for the nationally oriented events like March Madness or the concerts fights that we have.","I think that if you look at our portfolio, you\u2019re going to see even without M Life adding to the mix, but certainly that would be additive, a more broad based recovery and a more broad based strength in our business, not just on the room side, but on the non-gaming revenue side and on the gaming side.","And that\u2019s the opportunity, which is a good way to end because why we\u2019re so excited here is that we knew and I think we all collectively agreed that for Las Vegas to come back, the convention business had to lead the way. That has happened.","We also knew that we needed to restore Las Vegas' visitations. We could hit a record, an all time record in visitation in Las Vegas this year. Then we knew that, well people have to start spending a little bit more money when they get here and I think you\u2019ve heard from us in the last couple of calls is that RevCore, the total revenue per occupied room is starting to go higher and that certainly is the case here in 2012 and I think that all points to the fact that Las Vegas will have in general, not just ourselves, but the market will have a much better year in '12 because the recovery of revenue is more broad based than it was last year and everyone including ourselves are managing our costs.","And so the flow through we talked about earlier should be felt strip wide. We certainly are going to try to maximize that here as a company. I think it\u2019s going to grow throughout the year.","So with that, of course we\u2019re always around. Please give any of us a call if you have any follow up questions. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call and thank you for your support of the company, and thank you Grant for staying up so late.","Operator","","And this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com and a replay of the call will be made available on our website. We furnished our press release this morning on Form 8-K to the SEC as well.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance.

Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I am quite pleased to report strong second quarter results for MGM. Our wholly-owned domestic resorts increased our EBITDA by 11% year-over-year, driven by both our Las Vegas Strip properties and our regional properties. Margins increased by over 150 basis points year-over-year, and profit growth was very broad-based across our entire portfolio of assets and operating segments.","CityCenter resort operations' EBITDA increased by 4% year-over-year driven by growth across the entire campus. MGM China reported EBITDA of $132 million down year-over-year due to the continued market weakness, but despite this decrease, Grant and his team have been able to improve margins sequentially quarter-over-quarter.","Our strong operating performance provides a great platform to launch a seminal internal transformation that we call our Profit Growth Plan. This is the product of 10 months of hard work aimed at redesigning our entire company to produce sustainable gains in profit. So, I'd like to take a few moments to provide some context to this plan.","As you know, every year, we go through a strategic planning process and that includes an in-depth review of the current macro trends and a holistic view of our industry. We also obviously look for ways to constantly improve profitability.","When we undertook this process late last year, we recognized that the U.S. economy, though growing, was proceeding at a slow pace. And as operators, we have prided ourselves on our ability to consistently improve our margins, end results and outpace the market.","So since last year, we went deeper across all components of our business and challenged ourselves to rethink how we operate. And in doing so, we developed literally hundreds of ideas and we formulated a rigorous process to evaluate these ideas, and of course, we brought an outside expertise to assist us with the execution of the ideas and the strategies that we deem most viable and to track and report on our progress.","Our Profit Growth Plan will allow us to increase revenues through enhancing of sales and pricing, while leveraging our assets, and of course, as well to reduce expenses by re-looking entirely how we run our business more effectively, using our scale to improve our purchasing power, streamlining some key back-of-the-house areas as well utilizing technology to improve better analytics and forecasting tools.","And in the second quarter, we introduced the plan internally within the company and we officially launched it internally in July. Our plan will strengthen our company's organizational structure, permanently improve the way we operate, organically increase margins and profitability and strategically position MGM for the future.","This is a thoughtful, collaborative effort that requires participation at every level within our company. There is still tremendous work to be done and it will not be easy, but we know we can make this work because we have the best teams in our business. And this requires a focus on change management, because the most impactful of the improvements require a different approach to operations and marketing than the industry standard.","While upper management has kicked off this charge, we have made a concerted effort to engage all levels within our company, soliciting ideas from employees who truly live and breathe these processes. Among other things, this process is about empowering our employees, to ensure that we do not compromise in any way the guest experience at our resorts, but rather improve the experience and ultimately drive value for our company.","Of the ideas we've identified, we've honed in on a subset of high-value initiatives which will be rolled out this year and in 2016. And therefore, by 2017, we believe we will generate approximately $300 million of incremental profit.","To be clear, this benefit is incremental to our normal business growth projections. Approximately $250 million of this improvement will be driven by our wholly-owned domestic resorts and the balance will come from corporate expense and our joint ventures. We believe we can drive our property EBITDA margins back to the 30% level in 2017 and this effort will be a major catalyst in helping us achieve this goal.","Our Profit Growth Plan will proactively allow us to better align ourselves in today's business environment and continue to drive value for our employees, guests, communities and shareholders. I am extremely excited about how our company is embracing this effort, thus far, to uniquely position ourselves as the leader in the industry and how we approach our business. And, of course, we'll get into this in the Q&A more, but we will update you to be clear on this every single quarter on our progress on the Profit Growth Plan.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about our operating results and our financial position.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, thank you, Jim. In Las Vegas, we guided for at least 5% REVPAR growth in our wholly-owned strip properties and actually achieved 6% in the quarter. Our wholly-owned strip EBITDA margins increased roughly 140 basis points to approximately 27%. We saw increases in many segments of our business including our casino, hotels, and food and beverage businesses.","During the quarter, our convention business improved year-over-year and we also had a strong event calendar highlighted by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight in May. Our diverse portfolio continues to benefit from an improving marketplace as evidenced by our non-luxury strip resorts producing REVPAR and EBITDA growth of 9% and 14%, respectively, while our luxury strip resorts grew by 5% and 9%, respectively.","Looking forward, we continue to see strong convention bookings in the back half of this year. In fact, we went into 2015 expecting to be flat year-over-year in terms of our convention room mix. With a stronger than anticipated end-of-year for the year bookings, we now expect to outperform 2014's record year in terms of that convention mix.","And based on our current trends, we expect third quarter wholly-owned strip REVPAR growth to be approximately 6%. Our regional properties had another great quarter as we continue to gain share. Our regional resorts grew EBITDA by 10% with Detroit and Tunica each up 8% and Beau up solid at 17%. These resorts collectively increased margins by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter.","CityCenter resort operations' EBITDA increased 4% year-over-year driven by strength across the entire campus, as Crystals and Vdara achieved record results.","Aria reported EBITDA of $63 million, primarily driven by record year-over-year REVPAR growth of 8% and increased catering and banquet business related to our corporate and convention bookings was exceptionally strong in the quarter.","Looking at the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents and deposits on hand at the end of the quarter were approximately $2.5 billion, of which, approximately $522 million was at MGM China. We had $1.1 billion in available liquidity under our corporate revolver and approximately $1.7 billion of excess cash on hand.","On July 15, we repaid $875 million senior notes with cash on hand and we continue to focus on improving our balance sheet, having reduced our total debt by $2.3 billion at MGM Resorts this year. CityCenter cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $192 million and total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.5 billion.","In June, with the support of our lenders, MGM China amended and restated its senior credit facility, upsizing the term loan by $1 billion, increasing their total capacity under the facility to $3 billion. The amendment also extended the maturity date by 18 months to April of 2019, and currently, MGM China has approximately $1.55 billion outstanding in term loans and has roughly $1.4 billion in available liquidity under its revolver.","In terms of CapEx during the quarter, we invested approximately $197 million in total CapEx related to our domestic operations. That included about $98 million on National Harbor and Springfield in the quarter. In addition, we invested approximately $15 million as part of our arena joint venture equity contributions. During the second quarter, MGM China spent approximately $8 million at MGM Macau and $96 million on our MGM Cotai development.","And just to kind of help with a few modeling points going forward. As you've recently seen, we've announced a new theatre project at the Monte Carlo. We expect to incur some one-time expenses at both Luxor and MGM as we relocate some of the existing shows, Blue Man Group and Jabbawockeez into Luxor and MGM, respectively. And we anticipate expenses related to such moves to be approximately $6 million in each of the next two quarters. That will impact those properties, predominantly at Luxor.","Corporate expense for the second half of the year will be up slightly as we incur some upfront costs to implement our Profit Growth Plan, as well as other corporate initiatives. As a result, corporate expense in the third quarter is expected to be $60 million to $65 million for Q3.","With that, I'll turn it over to Grant for an update on Macau.","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","Thanks, Dan. Good morning, good evening, everybody. In the second quarter, Macau total gaming revenue was down 37% year-on-year. While for MGM China, net revenues of $557 million was down by 33% year-on-year. We recorded an adjusted EBITDA of $142 million, a decrease of 37% year-on-year and that was before the license fee of $10 million compared to $14 million last year.","Despite the opening of a new property in Macau, MGM's market share in June actually increased over April and May. More importantly, we've been able to maintain our margins in the current market that Jim indicated. Our property EBITDA margin before license fee was 25.5% during the quarter, a 20-basis-point sequential improvement compared to the first quarter.","Over the years, we have run our business with a lean and efficient operation in this dynamic market, and we continue to manage our costs and streamline our operation in a disciplined manner while remaining focused on our main floor business by offering high quality experiences consistent with our namesake property.","On the main floor table games win dropped by 23% year-on-year and this was in line with the market performance and declined by 5% sequentially compared to the broader market decline of 7.5%. In June, we have completed the first phase of expansion of our supreme lounge, including adding 61 high-limit slot machines. The early read shows customers have reacted positively to this remodeling.","Our mix shift towards the high-margin main floor business continued in the second quarter with a record high of 80% of MGM's China's profit coming from the mass segment. We continue to shift tables from VIP to mass with an additional 49 tables to the main floor versus last year and this now represents nearly 60% of our table allocation.","Despite additional tables on the main floor and increase of table operating hours, we've had a stable average head count per open hour. In other words, our strategy of capacity and resource allocation managed to drive incremental main floor play visitation.","VIP table games revenue decreased by 43% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower turnover, which declined 54% year-over-year, while hold percentage increased to 3.2% from 2.7% in the prior-year quarter.","MGM China continues to compete with a focus on precision of their marketing efforts like quality offerings and best-in-class service standards. Our implementation of our targeted marketing initiatives is expected to drive existing customer share of wallet, while seeking opportunities for new customer acquisition. Expanding and yielding the database are always our key priorities.","Today, the board of MGM China also announced an interim dividend of $77 million, representing a payout of 35% of net income. At MGM Cotai, we are on target to complete all floors in the hotel tower by early November this year. Our spectacle roof structure is progressing quickly with the completion milestone in September. The majority of our set out contracts have been awarded and we will be commencing the set out of the casino areas in August. We remain on target for fourth quarter of 2016 opening.","And with that, I'd like to turn back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Grant. The second quarter is a vivid example of how our company differentiates itself with our dominate entertainment position and the diversity of our resort offerings in our markets. We hosted a great variety of events. We showcased all of our properties, as well as the City and really as a whole on a worldwide stage. And all our properties really truly delivered across the board.","Bellagio's margins were the best of the strip luxury resorts in the quarter. MGM Grand shined as the host of the big fight. Aria, our newest resort on the strip has secured its place as one of the most profitable resorts in Las Vegas. Crystals is leading the way in Las Vegas on the retail experience and our core properties again outperformed the market. And we believe we're just getting started.","The first phase of the expansion at Mandalay Bay's Convention Center is opening this month and the demand is incredible The Las Vegas arena is looking great and we've also recently announced the 5,000-seat theater at Monte Carlo. And now, we'll open up to the park in the entertainment district and create a truly unique experience. They will be great additions to Las Vegas, to our entertainment offerings and to the benefit of the neighborhood. And we own the neighborhood.","We will continue to work on growing this market and we're encouraged by the strength of not only our forward convention calendar, but the increased visitation to Las Vegas as a whole and the strong airline passenger growth, as well as the projected additional airline capacity coming into the marketplace. This dynamic, along with the implementation of our Profit Growth Plan and our development pipeline, we believe, will allow us to grow our business and outperform in the markets in which we operate.","And to be clear, this plan sits on top of our company and does not mean we have lost focus on evaluating all of our strategic options. And in fact, our board and management teams have been looking at this aggressively. And it remains clear that there is a significant value gap between how the market values our assets and what we believe they're worth.","And as you know, we've been reviewing this phenomenon for over a year with the added brainpower of our external advisers, legal tax financials. We see various great strategic options for our business going forward. We have a benefit of having a broad portfolio of properties and brands in many markets, much more than most. And that is an advantage that creates multiple options for us. It also creates an obligation as we need to take the appropriate time to thoroughly vet all of these opportunities. And of course, this includes various real estate structures and we need to narrow the field in terms of what is best to continue to maximize short, medium and long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.","And I'm pleased to say we're getting much closer to that decision and we'll be able to provide our conclusions by the end of the year, if not, sooner. I think we have the right advisors in place, the proper internal focus and brainpower, and we will determine the best course of action for all of our constituents.","And with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over. So, we can move into Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody. Good evening to you, Grant. Not surprisingly, I have a bunch of questions, Jim, related to your Profit Growth Plan. One, can you talk about the $300 million that I know was over a period of time, can you clarify how much of that is operating expense related versus revenue related, and then how much of the $250 million that you said relates to wholly-owned relates to the Las Vegas Strip. And I have a couple of follow-ups.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Joe, I'll tackle that, and then I'll turn it over to Corey or Chris, if you want to correct me or add to it. First, I want to stress the complexity of this plan. We focused on this last year with the idea of not looking for quick fixes or one-time gains. That would be a mistake and detrimental to our business going forward.","So, it was the effort of literally hundreds, Joe, of senior managers here that have engaged in this process; and of course, as I said, months of work and hundreds of ideas were evaluated, confirmed for the design and the planning of it. We devised implementation plans for the ones that we've added and approved; and, as importantly, devised a tracking plan, so we can mark-to-market our progress.","A lot of what we're doing requires a change to the way the industry has always conducted practices in operations. So, that requires significant change management. So, we've worked on that internally. We brought an outside help to help us on that, and we've also benchmarked against companies in other industries. That's where the outside consultants have really helped us. So, sustainable change, not quick one-time gains.","Within the Profit Growth Plan itself, I would say about a third of it is revenue uplift and about two-thirds would be to change the way we're doing business to reduce the cost of doing business with the overarching focus that it will not hurt; but in fact, help the guest experience by empowering our employees more to be able to interact with guests and do less drudgery of day-to-day analytics and bureaucracy. So, one \u2013 I think that's kind of a mix.","Now, in terms of Las Vegas versus regionals, just by the scope and scale of our Las Vegas resorts versus regionals, the majority of it is obviously on the strip. So, if you're looking at the $250 million number that I gave you, I'd say about $225 million of it is here in Las Vegas and another $25 million spread between our regional properties.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And just so I kind of understand this, of the two-thirds that is related to how you do business and as a means to reduce your operating expenses, and you mentioned a few times before that this is incremental, so all things being equal, if revenues are flat, we would expect the OpEx reductions to result in higher margins. So, even what's characterized as reducing operating expenses and not revenue related, you would still expect to see the margins benefit by this like amount.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. And also, to emphasize the point, this is on top of any other growth that we expect to see in our markets. And we are quite constructive on the Las Vegas market from a macro perspective. So, we have sized this, we have evaluated it, and we viewed it as a margin growth plan as well as a profit plan specific to, in addition to, our incremental growth.","And let me make another point on that. We undertook a significant cost reduction plan back in 2008 and 2009, when we had to in a crisis situation. And to just remind people of that point and why we have not lost focus on this is our FTEs today are still down 15% from the time of where they were in 2007. So, if this is not a major FTE reduction plan, they're already down and have been down for years.","And as you know, we've been improving our margins since 2010. And so, the Profit Growth Plan was initiated not for that purpose, but under the belief that we can do better in a variety of significant business processes based on our analysis of best-in-class companies in other industries.","And we took this right to the top at our board level last year and have been engaging our board ever since. And so, I just want to make that clear that this is separate from and additive to the work around not only our operating performance and the strategic initiatives we have under way.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","And Joe, this is Corey. There are some labor opportunities including in centralizing some areas that we haven't quite centralized yet that we think there's not only tremendous opportunity on labor side, but also better product coming out of that group. We also think that there's some labor savings on forecasting and scheduling using our technology from that perspective also.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Then I have kind of two quick follow-ups on this. How do you see the improvements pacing between what you started last month and by the end of 2017, how much do you think you get in the first six months, first year, first year-and-a-half? And then following up on that, will this profit improvement be reinvested in the business, be used to pay down debt? Where does that incremental free cash flow from this go? Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, we're going to give you a more precise number on that next quarter, Joe. But imagine that many of these initiatives, it's the rule of big numbers. So, a very big majority of the profit growth will come from a handful of really important strong initiatives. Those were the ones we're tackling first. So, we've honed it down and prioritized the different projects. Each project has a project leader, by the way, throughout the company. We've taken property Presidents and significant corporate people, made them the team leader on these different projects. They report directly to Chris Nordling who is riding herd over this entire project.","And you can imagine, we want to get to the big ones first. And so, they'll be rolled out this year. The impact of the big ones will be felt \u2013 the majority, obviously, will be felt in 2016. And as we roll out some of the ones that take longer to set up, because of systems, because of training and education, that's why we need about 14 months to 18 months to fully deploy this and why I gave you a year-end 2016 target date to get the full impact in 2017.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And Joe, to answer your question around use of proceeds, so to speak, the goal is to continue and the focus continues to be on reducing leverage and improving the balance sheet. So it's our intent to continue paying down debt with these incremental free cash flow dollars.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. That's all for me. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Just a quick follow-up. The $300 million, Jim, does that also factor in the impact of inflation, just basic lift in your overall costs or is that a number that by the time we get to 2017 really should be flowing through the income statement?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It should be flowing through the income statement and we'll be tracking this and reporting on a quarterly basis from the next quarter on.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And then, Jim, just following up on the strategic options. There's been some discussion of The Mirage being on the market. Can you talk about whether or not it's actually on the market? And basically, what I'm trying to get at is the Pinnacle assets, the implied multiple on those is like 30% higher than what yours are being valued at. So my question is, is the thinking that you'll establish kind of a benchmark in Vegas of selling, perhaps, one asset and maybe the rest of the assets lift? Whatever you can give in terms of which way you're headed would be helpful.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Harry. The Mirage is not on the market. The Mirage is an outstanding property with tremendous employees that we covet and respect dearly. We don't put properties on the market. That said, we don't put a for-sale sign out on any of our resorts. We have bought and sold properties and companies over the last 20 years and the last thing we would do is put a for-sale sign on any property.","That said, I'd make a couple of points that I agree with you, number one. The virtue of not selling any properties, particularly on the strip over the last couple of years has been clearly vindicated by the growth of the asset values since that time. And I would posit that gaming assets have increased 30% to 50% just in the last year and year-and-a-half alone. So when we evaluate asset sales or asset purchases, we look at the macro environment, what level is the cash flows in the case of properties we own we're achieving, where we believe those properties will get to and we look at valuations.","And we have been rewarded for not selling anything in the past, clearly given the market valuations not only of the related mark-up properties, but the Cosmopolitan and Tropicana or the Riviera and other examples. And an asset sale of any significance needs to be carefully weighed against real estate structures. If in fact, an asset is a valuable potential REIT candidate or a part of a portfolio of REIT properties, you'd have to take that into account before you determined what to do with the property.","So I think that this all will be more clear to everyone including everyone on the phone by the end of this year, because we have \u2013 Dan and I and the team have made this a priority to come to a conclusion to narrow the field of options strategically as we promise our investors earlier this year come up with the best possible structure for the company, and we have the luxury of shooting for perfection in terms of a structure because we don't have to decide tomorrow.","And the fact that we have a significant amount of external advisors on this for over a year. And we have great tax, legal and finance people internally, I'm confident we're going to come to the best solution for the shareholders for the medium and long-term.","So in answer to the question, I saw the news report, too. I tend not to get my news from those sources. But I could tell you that there is tremendous amount of interest for Las Vegas real estate. We obviously own the best real estate in Las Vegas. Therefore, we're getting the spotlight from potential buyers. Dan and I meet with anybody that's qualified and have for years. And we'll have more to report on our corporate structure going forward, but to be clear, The Mirage is not being actively marketed at all.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. So just a final thought; it may be repetitive. But from the perspective of the valuation gap that we perceived, you are highly confident that that's going to close.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I am highly confident that it's going to close.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Excellent. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Just kind of moving on to your results in the quarter. Jim and Dan, the flow-through and your performance is certainly impressive and your optimistic outlook is definitely great to hear. Just wondering in the second quarter, if you could help us understand just how much of your performance benefited from the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, and then how much of it is sustainable. And also, how should \u2013 given the Profit Growth Plan, how should we think about your flow-through goals going forward? Does that increase the 50%?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, I'll start with the last one there, Felicia. This is Dan. We're focused on the margin side. I mean, the whole concept of flow-through is a difficult one, and I'll highlight an example. We did benefit from the Mayweather fight, which is an outstanding event for the weekend. And a part of the accounting for the Mayweather fight and some of the activities around the Mayweather fight actually impacted our flow-through. And so, it actually negatively impacted, because of the accounting, flow-through by four percentage points to five percentage points in the quarter.","And so, we're not going to run the business because of flow-through, because that was some pretty profitable business to be had over that weekend. And so, again, for us, we're focused on margin improvement. And as Jim pointed out earlier, our goal is to get this company back to where it once was in terms of that 30% EBITDA property margin level. And so, we'll continue to kind of stay focused.","It was a great quarter. The fight did have an impact on our operations across the board. Whether you're looking at food and beverage, because of all the events we hosted in our buildings, whether you're looking at the hotel ADR, which probably benefited anywhere from a half to a full percentage point in terms of our REVPAR growth in the quarter, it did have an impact in the quarter overall.","And that's not to say that we don't have other events or other opportunities going forward. There'll be more fights, there'll be more concerts and more events to continue to drive that traffic and those volumes into the building.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And maybe, I can add, Dan. It doesn't sound intuitively obvious that that fight hurt flow-through in that sense. But, the reason why it did is we hosted several great pay-per-view events in our properties.","From an accounting perspective, I don't think it makes sense, but I'm not an accountant \u2013 we have to book 100% of that revenue. We don't receive that revenue, but we have to book 100% of the revenue and the expense. So yes, having the parties themselves were very effective, had great play, a lot of people in town, but from a purely accounting perspective, it hurt flow-through by 400 basis points.","Now, the margin will be the key as Dan said, and we're going to focus on that and we think we're going to get to our target and we'll be able to therefore hopefully improve flow-through just by coincidence, but it's not going to be a focus of the company.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then just switching gears; Grant, hopefully you're still with us.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","We hope so, too.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess we've started to see some stabilization on the mass side. Obviously, the question is what does that mean going forward, how are things going to go? I know no one has a crystal ball, but just wondering how you think this all plays into next year, and given some government policy changes, the transit visas and now maybe some less optimistic commentary about the smoking ban recently, I'm just wondering when you think about 2016, are you seeing it was more of a share shifting game, or do you see the market growing as you kind of try to plan for your property?","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","I think, obviously, there's quite a bit of capacity coming into the market. So clearly, we all need to drive for growth and let's hope that with some stabilization we'll get that. But I think what's really critical \u2013 and it's not just similar to the conversation that Jim just gone through, we really now need to look at process reengineering and everything we are doing in terms of opening Cotai is taking advantage to try and lever those opportunities for both this property in Cotai.","So, I guess until the \u2013 some of policy changes are actually effective because we can't \u2013 clearly, we can't affect those. A real lot of focus going into making sure that our process engineering is going well. And if we get the growth that we'd all like to see, that should bode well for the performance and how much we can pull down. And so, I don't really think there's a lot of differences between the business initiatives that are going on in Las Vegas and what we really need to do here.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And just as a follow-up for you, Grant, when you think about, perhaps, some of \u2013 just given what's going on in the environment now, perhaps, some inflated FTEs relative to where you would like that to be in a perfect world and then as you think about what you need at your new property, is there some kind of FTE savings, if you will, as you think about opening that new property? Can you talk a little bit about that?","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","Absolutely. And I think that's what I mean about process reengineering. We are already adopting the shared service strategies. We are consolidating a lot of that oversight and strategic and management support. And we think that's very important. And we've already seen some really significant performance improvements over the last two quarters in terms of FTE management and that's an indicator of the quality of analytics that we've now got in place.","So, it's both structural but it's also executional. You can have all the ideas you like, but you're going to make sure they're working. And these difficult times are actually giving us that opportunity to really test out that logic side. Yes, we are looking for a significant productivity and performance improvement.","For now, yes, because it's good from a cost space, but also because I think we also understand we're going to be challenged by the availability of labor in the market and particularly the skills in the market, which we always know is an issue. But, we're really responding to what we know is happening. And if it's a silver lining to these difficult times, it's a little bit like 2008-2009, where the industry responded and reacted accordingly and it really gave us the margin shift that frankly the industry has been able to retain.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Jim, your comments earlier as it pertains to your assets and the concept of the REIT. I have a two-part question. First off is, how do you guys contemplate within the context of the many iterations you might be looking at? How do you think about a sale-leaseback type of structure, given your cost of capital today? And then conversely, as you think about the development projects that you currently have, how could or how do they kind of fit into the mindset of some of your thinking around how you could potentially structure that?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I don't want to get too much into our thinking right now, if you don't mind. But we're not opposed to the structure, if that helps on that point without getting too detailed on that. But I will say, maybe if you'll look at \u2013 help you a little bit more on our development projects. It's clear to us, at least, that the two projects that we have underway right now in the United States are going to be very successful.","Most importantly, because of the timing of it and the scale, the National Harbor project in Maryland, it opens up at the end of next year followed by Springfield. Clearly, in light of our views of not only the size of those two markets for us, but also the durability and consistency and predictability of the cash flows, they make great candidates as to regional properties in general for that type of structure. Witness our Detroit property which, for year after year, has produced outstanding financial results.","We're not also opposed to the concept in Las Vegas for that matter. And if you were to have the view, you might, that we have that Las Vegas is going to continue to grow and then MGM Resorts will do better than the market, because of the significant capital that we are willing to and have been investing to improve our properties, then you would have confidence of the levels of cash flows that could also support, reach sale-leaseback structures.","So, we are in a position of, we think, of unique strength in the sense of having strong assets, great brands, great predictability of cash flows in our regionals, growing cash flows in our Las Vegas properties, and the benefit have been working on something with the luxury of thought or analysis over the past year, which is why, for the first time, we're willing to say that we're months away from coming up with a conclusion to our board. And then, once we have a conclusion with our board, we'll be sharing it with everyone else.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, Jim. That's helpful. And then, Dan, if I can just ask one follow-up. With respect to the 6% REVPAR guidance for the 3Q, do you expect a similar skew between the luxury and non-luxury assets in the 3Q similar to kind of what we saw in the 2Q?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yeah, I think that's fair. I think you're seeing a nice pickup in terms of those non-luxury properties and their ability, particularly in the retail and the leisure space and segments to gain a little bit of traction in terms of their ability to kind of price those rooms up. So, I think that's a fair assessment.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And maybe, Dan, I'd also add that because we're seeing great growth in end-of-year, before-the-year convention business. And we see that throughout the year, by the way, not just in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and into next year, the core properties really benefit from that phenomenon as they have been for the last couple of years. And we think there's significant upside potential in the core properties side in the quarter. We think there's a lot more to come because of the macro environment on the convention side.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, just sorry, if I could, one follow-up, the old adage of $5 of rate is $50 million of EBITDA, is that still appropriate in the current construct?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","I think that's fair, Carlo.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. So, just sort of turn to the Profit Growth Plan, Jim, I think you did a great job of laying everything out in sort of mix and dollars and then you sort of alluded to this 30% margin target, and I'm curious and thinking about it in margin percentage terms, that 30% number that you mentioned is not across the portfolio overall and how would you think about that number being in sort of Las Vegas versus some of the regional properties. Can it be at similar levels between those two? We don't need too much granularity, but any direction would help?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. There's a lot of similarity between our wholly-owned Las Vegas properties and our regionals in terms of margins. And so, I think you'd see it across the portfolio. All properties, we think, will benefit from the plan, all of the ones that we have.","In the case of the Las Vegas properties, clearly, some of the great initiatives will be company-wide and not property-specific. So, I don't think we gave a couple of examples \u2013 I'll give you a couple of examples.","So, for example, in purchasing, we've taken a while on this, but we've created a consistent set of specs for a variety of our products including all of our in-room amenities, for example, our towels and linens, for so many different towels and linens that we have...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Eight different versions.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Eight different versions. So, we have gotten together as an organization and developed the optimum spec for our luxury properties, different specs for our core properties and tremendously reduce the amount of waste that we have and cost in terms of procuring, cleaning, maintaining our linens, towels.","On the F&B side, same kind of process. We've done this over the years with various degrees of success, but we really drilled into this starting last year and got really aggressive on how do we not only produce the best products for our guests and keep with the trends of today of farm-to-table organic, local and create the best possible food product for our guests and for our employees, but do a much better job leveraging our scale, going directly to farmers and ranchers, going directly to the source. Cutting out some of the middlemen, we can negotiate far better rates and terms, if we use our scale.","In the area of our employees, we have been thoughtful on this. This isn't an employee reduction plan at all. This is about streamlining the layers of management that we have, that any gaming company has within our organizational structure and increasing the span of responsibility of the employees themselves. We've learned a lot and I have to give a special thank you to a couple companies that have helped us more recently. FedEx was terrific as an example. Coca-Cola has been wonderful in talking to us.","And so, we haven't just looked at the hospitality industry, although we have, obviously. We've reached out into organizations that has embarked on improvement plans whatever they have in the column over the last several years and picked up some best practices. And we've enhanced them. I think we've been working on it for so long and made it very MGM-specific. So, I think you'll see a lot of specific of what \u2013 we will give you a lot of specifics around these plans on a going-forward basis. But we've been excited about this day, because it's the culmination of almost a year of work internally and externally to come up with a robust number that we expect to achieve.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Really appreciate all that detail. And then, the second \u2013 or my follow-up question would be to hit on the strategic alternatives. So you've kind of talked about Mirage and you've talked about real estate. But one other area that I think makes a lot of sense for you guys, is \u2013 and where there's a lot of opportunities, joint ventures, and in the quarter, I believe, you guys exited and were able to sell some of your joint venture assets in Reno. Can you talk a little bit about some of the opportunity you see in that and how do you think either Wall Street or the world sort of views the JVs and what some of your \u2013 what may be at least on the plate as it relates to the JV portfolio?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. First, the philosophy of what we have contracted thus far. Up in Reno, we have a tremendous history and affection for the Carano family. This was not an action we took lightly and likely would not have been an action we would have undertaken at all, if not for our confidence in the buyer, because of the overarching concern we have for \u2013 of the employees in the communities themself.","So, these aren't actions you undertake lightly. We, as you know, have sold properties, many properties over the years, thinking of Golden Nugget, the Primm properties, Laughlin. But, we're very thoughtful on that. We think it's important.","As it relates to the existing joint ventures, we have not many left. Obviously, the largest is CityCenter itself. And we've been working with our equity partners on ways to return cash to the shareholders. We've already done that once. We expect to continue to do it and we do have some ideas as relates to monetizing some of the CityCenter assets going forward.","For those of you who are out here or going to visit soon, you'll note, which is happy news for us that Bobby Baldwin has finished deconstructing the nightmare that was the Harmon. And that allows us to spend really constructive time to develop ideas of what would maximize that two-plus acres parcel run on the corner of the strip. And clearly, though we're not ready to explain all the ideas that we have, you'd have to believe that an expansion of Crystals is the overarching use of that property and there could be others.","Crystals itself is an extraordinary valuable asset. We've discussed it on prior calls and don't think that we've lost sight of that. We believe that not only it's more valuable today than it was even last quarter, but we believe with the growth plan, it would be more valuable still going forward. That and other non-gaming assets are certainly open to discussion and we are having that discussion at the CityCenter board level.","As it relates to other joint ventures, they're not a focus of ours right now in terms of let the ultimate disposition, whether we're buyers or sellers of those assets because we've got, I think, bigger issues, bigger opportunities to deal with before we hit some of the smaller JVs.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Jones of Union Gaming. Please go ahead.","Christopher Jones - Union Gaming Research LLC","Hi, great. Thank you. Two quick questions, first, can you just talk a little bit about your casino revenues on the Vegas Strip obviously outperforming into broader market of Nevada, Las Vegas Strip. And maybe even talk a little bit about what drove that, where the strength was coming from even despite the fact some headwinds from the Chinese, the baccarat customer and if really the regional strategy, how much of that played into that as well? That's my first question. The second one is are there any sort of overarching or overall macro assumptions that you can provide around your profit improvement and then over the next couple of years that we can sort of apply to our models as well? Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hey, Chris. This is Dan. I'll start and I'm sure Bill and Corey will chime in as well. I think when we look at kind of our second quarter performance, it was really strength from our domestic side of the business.","As you point out, the China source business is still down year-over-year, given what's going on in that part of the world. Clearly, the events we host are more domestic-driven for the most part, whether it's the Mayweather fight or Rock in Rio which was spread over two weekends and was a great event. I think it brought some 170,000 folks over those two weekends into town. Those clearly were helpful.","So when you look at our table games and our slot business ex-baccarat on the table game side, we continue to gain share as we look at the programs and the assets that we have in the market and what we're doing to drive that business from the entertainment side as well. So largely domestic in the quarter. We are seeing continued weakness in the China-sourced play. That's offset by some other pickup in other Asian markets that we're seeing, not offsetting them entirely, but we are seeing a pickup in some other markets in Asia that has benefited the softness out of China.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. And I would add, it was such a good domestic quarter to the best one. We track our quarters since 2007. It was the best quarter we have from a national marketing side ever from that tracking perspective. And the Mayweather fight was interesting because it did attract people from all over the world and people that we know very well and people we haven't seen in a while. But the quality of events besides Mayweather, the Eagles, the Bette Midlers, all those events attract that domestic customer.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Billboard Awards, I think we had too, Corey. And we had a great July by the way and that's not a typical month for international customers. So, we're off to a good start here in the third quarter, and I would have to say that's really domestically driven.","Christopher Jones - Union Gaming Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks, Chris. Maybe we'll take one more question, operator.","Operator","Absolutely. Our final question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Well, I'm trying to fit one in here, just on the 3Q REVPAR guidance. We've been hearing from investors from the past few weeks or months just about a forward rate surveys looking pretty weak especially during the summer. So, just wondering why you guys maybe bucking the trend on those rates surveys and just making sure that you're not relying too much in the quarter for the quarter business or maybe a big pickup in September or anything like that? Thanks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thomas, I'll start. And I'm sure others will chime in. I think the strength that we're seeing is underwritten really by the convention business and it's not just what we're hoping that we book. It's actually things that we are booking. We've seen a tremendous pickup going into the back half of the year.","In terms of that in the year, particularly as certain segments of the convention business whether you're looking at tech companies or pharmaceutical companies, we've had a nice pickup and I think that's a testament to the folks operating these buildings and the assets themselves and our ability to grow that and gain that market share, not just here in Las Vegas, but in the competitive, more national set as we're going up against multiple cities and multiple venues that we're competing against for that business.","They're doing an outstanding job in securing and winning that business, and it's really the toolkit we have. I mean, when you look at the assets we have from top to bottom throughout the organization, the price points we can offer, the venues we can give and \u2013 I don't use arenas on Tuesday nights, but if a tech company wants to do a sponsored show at Mandalay Events Center or MGM Grand on a Tuesday night, I've got that competitive advantage that others in this market or other markets don't have. So, I think this is a true testament of the diversity of our product and what we're capable to do in the marketplace.","We're also seeing a nice pickup going into the third quarter and the back half of the year in our retail and our leisure business. And as you all know, the third quarter is largely leisure and retail-focused. So, with the backdrop of the strong convention calendar and a nice pickup in our retail and leisure business, we feel highly confident in what we'll be able to achieve in the back half of the year.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Maybe I would add, Dan \u2013 I'm sorry, Bill. Would you \u2013 go ahead.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - President","Yeah. Just maybe one comment, Tom. You may recall two years ago, we put in a fairly robust structure of regional sales organization in offices, and frankly, it's paying dividends. I mean, we have stretched ourselves out across the country much like a Marriott or a Star would, and we're focusing on the right industries and the right places. And we've got people out there approaching that business every day, and we think it's paying off.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And then, I think we mentioned it, but when you're out, please take a look at the convention extension at Mandalay. That's really important. And before we got the board to approve the capital for that, we had Mike Dominguez and the team go out and solicit levels of interest and the response was strong, but the reality has been better than our initial expectations and hopes.","And my last point, because I used to do room rate surveys for many years myself, that I think directionally generally, they're very good tools except for the third quarter. Third quarter is the toughest quarter really to gauge what's happening in Las Vegas, because of the seasonality of the third quarter and the summer months.","So, we feel confident in our REVPAR guidance in the third quarter. I think we hit our REVPAR guidance in just about every quarter in the last three years. So, we don't take that guidance lightly. We see a really nice REVPAR growth in the fourth quarter as well, because of that convention business that Dan, Corey, and Bill talked about. And I think that we're off to a really good start for next year.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, with that, I think we've taken everyone's allotted time. Thank you all very much for participating in the call; and as always, we're here to answer any questions that you have. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"15150":["MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) Q2 2017 Earnings Call July 27, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Daniel J.

Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Hornbuckle, President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; and Grant Bowie, CEO and Executive Director of MGM China Holdings Limited.","Participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Steven. And good morning and welcome to the MGM Resorts second quarter 2017 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and we have furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially for those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.

You can find the reconciliation of GAAP financial measures in the press release, which is also available on our website. Please also note that our supplemental earnings deck is posted on our website, which we hope you will continue to find helpful.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We're quite proud of the results we've reported this morning, and I think it's a tribute to what we've discussed many times before in terms of our focus on margin, profitability and the very hard work of the men and women that have brought incredible operational efficiencies to this organization. As you know, our cash flows rose in the quarter, and on a hold-adjusted basis, EBITDA would have been up 10%.","We've guided you, when we talked about the second quarter, to lower gaming revenue, higher non-gaming revenue, and margins that would be up slightly. We met that guidance and in fact, did better than we expected in terms of profitability and margin as a result of our initiatives. Our margins grew 82 basis points to just over 31% and that was despite the fact that we were down almost 5 percentage points year-over-year in table games hold. On a hold-adjusted basis, as I said cash flows would have been up about 10%, and our margins would have been up over 200 basis points on The Strip alone.","CityCenter had another outstanding quarter. Its revenues and cash flows grew 10% and 36% respectively, and our focus on margin has driven our operational efficiencies in every single department in which this company operates. We have achieved this despite the fact that we're investing in the future. As you know, we're dramatically transforming MGM's Monte Carlo property into Park MGM, that's been disruptive and will remain so throughout this year, and despite that, we're very comfortable where we see the Street in terms of earnings for the year.","Regionally, our properties continued to do dramatically outperform their competitors. MGM Detroit had an all-time record in terms of revenue and EBITDA. National Harbor is already the market leader in Maryland and of course Borgata continues to perform at an outstanding rate, and that is a tribute to Tom Ballance, retiring today from Borgata and moving into corporate, and the rest of the great team at Borgata. Obviously, the results in Macau as a market have been impressive, we are anxiously awaiting the opening of Cotai that will help us dramatically. That resort opens in a couple of months. Grant will talk more about it. But suffice to say that it would help not only drive more business to our MGM property on the Peninsula, but we believe it will be very dynamic and it's very successful in Cotai.","We've had a very strong year this year in Las Vegas, both in the first and in the second quarter. We just had another record at McCarran Airport in June, and the company has focused on maximizing the opportunities that are in front of us. And that means maximizing the revenue per occupied room in all of our resorts. That is the reason why our margins were up more than we expected. It's also the reason why RevPAR was below what our guidance was, as we consciously moved some occupancy away from higher ADR, but lower revenue per total occupied room into different channels, which resulted as you can see in higher profitability and higher margin, we expect that going forward.","We see a very good third quarter underway. We have many challenges in the quarter because of a huge citywide convention quarter last year, and we held very well as we indicated in the third quarter of 2016, but despite that because we have an epic fight coming up in a couple of weeks and because we have good business on the books, we expect to see profitability increase again and margins also increase again. We believe that going forward, that the second half of the year will remain strong and that we will continue to be able to improve our profitability and margins, and in fact we are raising our margin guidance from what we have said earlier because we see more opportunities to increase margin going forward, already the industry-leading margin and certainly here in Las Vegas.","This could be the second biggest fight of all time and it will certainly drive millions of people to watch Las Vegas, watch T-Mobile, and watch Mayweather and McGregor. We intend to maximize every $0.01 of profitability opportunity there and we're working very hard to accomplish that. I think we will be very successful. We've a lot to look forward to in the second half of the year, not only the opening of Cotai in the fourth quarter but the improvements that we're taking to all of our operations, which we see as accelerating our margin.","We're running this company for cash flow and if that has not been clear in the past, certainly was in this quarter and we will continue to do so going forward because we believe that's the best way to drive value to our shareholders and we intend to continue to be competitive in the marketplace when we find opportunities on the horizon and I think the opportunity currently on the horizon is Japan where I would say that we are one of the leaders in terms of contenders in that marketplace. I have to say that I'm proud of what we've done. But I believe that our best days are ahead of us and what we see today is more confidence in our business than we've seen in the last ten years.","So with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator, so we get to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Hey, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Jim, Dan, as you can imagine, we're getting a lot of calls and e-mails on your RevPAR commentary and change from a quarter ago. Can you talk about the 100 basis points of revision? How much of that relates, Jim, to what you talked about in terms of a focus on lowering occupancy, how much of it might relate to more disruption at Monte Carlo? Can you talk about how much of it relates to just maybe greater price elasticity for the consumer in Las Vegas? What led you to revise downwardly your RevPAR guidance?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure Joe, it's almost exclusively business decisions that we're making here. It does not reflect at all the health of the market and certainly does not reflect our perspective of the market in the second half of the year. When we started PGP, we were focused on many of the non-hotel areas where we could drive margin profitability, not only in terms of table games margins and overall casino margins, but in our non-gaming areas in terms of driving margin there. The hotel divisions of many of these resorts including ours have been run more independently and have been focused on driving RevPAR. We know that that's not the right approach in a casino hotel environment. That's not how you drive profitability.","No one here in this room that I'm aware of is bonused on RevPAR. We're bonused on profits. We made a decision when we moved from PGP to continuous improvement to dig in more on our hotel yielding and do it more holistically. We actually started that in the beginning of the year. It had a minimal impact on the first quarter, because we had such a strong convention calendar in the first quarter. It had more of an impact in terms of RevPAR in the second quarter, but we drove more profitability throughout the resorts in the second quarter. That's why revenue per occupied room in the second quarter was actually up over 5%. That's the important metric.","In terms of looking forward, we feel very strongly, and we know this business pretty well, the way to drive increased margin and increased profitability is the yield total resort from a standpoint of driving revenue into the resort, and that will have a dampening impact on RevPAR, and that's okay because we're trying to drive more profits. The only macro point I would say in the quarter was a little bit of a weakness, a little bit of softness in the early part of June. It was literally like a two-week period of time, and it bounced back right at the end of the month. But really that had minimal impact, and also we probably underestimated the impact of the disruption at Monte Carlo a little bit, but these are just fringe things, it's not the overall point.","I think the overall point is, on RevPAR as we're talking about it, a 1% difference in RevPAR. So in other words, instead of if we did 2.2% instead of 1.2% for our portfolio. A 1% delta is only $2 million of profit. A 1% increase in our margin just on The Strip is $14 million. We made a decision which we'll continue to make to focus on profitability and margin, and that really was the total story in terms of RevPAR in the second quarter, and the reason why we want people to be more focused on this in the third and fourth quarters. We're going to have a good third quarter, very strong despite the big city-wides that we saw last year and a 10% increase in RevPAR that we had last year. And we're going to have that because of a Mayweather-McGregor fight, a GGG-Canelo fight and some good convention business. But more importantly, I think we're going to be able to drive margins in the third quarter more than we had predicted when we began the year.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, helpful. And then just a quick question on Macau in the 2Q. Margins there were a bit lower, say, versus the last four quarters. Was there anything one-time there other than mix that drove that margin performance?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Grant, could you tackle that?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Sure, thanks. The answer is there is some mix changes we've seen, particularly in some of the premium end of the business, so we've seen some margins slightly depressed, but overall we're starting to see growth in the mid business range, though some of this is as Jim was indicating, is preparing ourselves for the business for Cotai coming on strength. So yes there was some reduction in margin and that was also a little bit of affected from luck effect in the premium end. But by and large it's just part of the process of transforming and getting ready for Cotai. The last comment I'd make about that is that we're seeing some constraints in terms of room inventory and as Jim indicated getting Cotai onstream for us is really important in terms of building our capacity and our ability to drive more volume.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, guys.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Thanks Joe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So just to stick on the quarter RevPAR for a second, I just think it would be helpful if we could just bridge from say maybe the midpoint of your guidance to the actual results. So, I hear what you are saying, you have like there are certain headwinds on RevPAR in the quarter, but then you said that they had minimal impact. So maybe if you could adjust for the disruption, the greater than disruption at Monte Carlo, maybe where would have RevPAR come in? I'm just having a hard time still understanding where the miss came from?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. So just adjust just for Monte Carlo, RevPAR would have been 1.8%.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, is there anything else in there like should we think about maybe an increase in resort fees that offset that or?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","No. No, we had predicted what we have in terms of resort fees in that number and in our prior guidance. Really the difference is Monte Carlo being a little tougher than we thought and a very short period of time in June. But I really want to emphasize the fact that we're moving away in Micah's team and our hotel yield team away from focusing on maximizing RevPAR. We've all known about this, both the sell-side, the buy-side, us at management, that that's not really the best way of running our business. But we didn't have the tools frankly, Felicia, earlier in our process until this year in terms of analytics, in terms of intelligence to yield these resorts in a more holistic way. And that's a manifestation of continuous improvement. We have people doing this now that we didn't have before, hired from other companies. And it will have a impact on total revenue per occupied room in a very positive way, we think.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then just, if I may step back for a minute and ask you a big picture question, because I think that there is an emerging kind of narrative coming out of this earnings season among some investors about the economy maybe perhaps slowing a bit. Certainly leisure is doing well, but on the business side, we've kind of seen in lodging and maybe some of the specifics that are coming out of Vegas, seeing some muted results. I mean, the June just came out today and the gaming results were better than we had expected, but again, this narrative is emerging. So when you look at your business which is a really nice mix of leisure and business, I'm wondering if, are you seeing any yellow flags at all from the consumer. What are your group meeting planners telling you? Is there any kind of comments you might want to make on what you're seeing economically right now?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","On the business side, Felicia, we see convention partners changing somewhat their convention practices. For example, some of the larger companies are consolidating some conventions. They might have five in a given year of a certain size and they're consolidating them down to three or four. That has some kind of volatility around some of the convention markets around the United States, and I think, a little bit to a lesser extent here in Las Vegas, but we've seen that trend occurring. The reality to that is they're actually driving a lot more delegates per convention obviously, as they consolidate the number of conventions. So, we see bigger spikes in convention attendance rather than what we had seen before.","As an example, we literally last week just finished Microsoft. They were in here, it was amazing for better part of a week. That's a convention as you know, we didn't have last July, and it was highly successful for us. So, I think the only \u2013 and I'll turn it over to others if they see anything differently, but the only thing we see a little bit differently is how companies are handling their convention business. Every other segment \u2013 and by the way, we're still going to be up in conventions, and we're still doing extremely well. And Las Vegas, I think is the beneficiary of this, because we're a better value destination. Every other segment is up: leisure for us, will drive you more people for our own channels, which is more profitable to us, our FIT business, the casino was very strong, and that's why total revenue per occupied room was up nicely in the quarter.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Yeah, I would add Felicia, that what we're seeing in the customers, and especially because of our intentional shift out of some of our lower end areas, and into our higher end areas is that their spend is up, and we're seeing that in entertainment, we're seeing that in food and beverage, we're seeing it across the portfolio slots. So, we don't really sense that the economy is suffering.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's really helpful. Thank you. Dan, a quick housekeeping. Were there any bad debt provision benefits in the quarter in either Las Vegas or Macau?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","I'll let Grant speak to Macau. As far as here in Las Vegas, we had a slight benefit of about $4 million in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And Grant, at Macau.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","And for Macau really nothing significant, less than a $1 million.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey, good morning. I wanted to catch Grant while he is still awake. I wondered how you plan to position the Cotai property? It is competitive. How will it be different from your experience on the Peninsula and what are your views on the competitive advantages that the building has?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Thanks, Harry. I'm wide awake. I think what's important is, while we might be last to open, we also have the advantage of watching everybody else come on board. And I think we've been clear right from the outset that we understand that the Cotai market is very different from the Macau market. But we also accept that we have certain characteristics. But we are strong there in terms of particularly the mass business. We also need to develop Cotai, the VIP business over time.","In terms of the property itself, the thing that's most important for us is capacity. We keep on saying this over and over again. Getting more rooms, getting more capacity in that marketplace. One of the things we're focused on most importantly as it's not just a question of being able to expand based on our current pool of customers. We understand that we need to tap into new customers to us who may already be in Cotai and I'm not saying specifically share shift, but about allocation of wallet. And so, we're very focused on bringing in additional resources, people with specific experience in the Cotai market, and also making sure we build strong relationships with the tour and travel marketplace in China about moving premium leisure travel market specifically.","So I guess, the critical point for us is not only maintaining intensity in the Macau property, getting increased capacity, but understanding that we need to spend and we are spending a lot of time building the volume of traffic and the pool of customers for us for Cotai. We're very excited about the physical attributes. I think everyone acknowledges that the building design is iconic and we're very excited as we progressively release to the market the facilities that we're bringing in. We're nearly finished launching all the food and beverage, and now we're starting to introduce the customer buys for the entertainment products, the nature of the interactive spaces that we're creating, which allows the consumers to basically build a lot of their own experiences, that will become more visible as we actually launch more of the products as we work our way up to the opening.","We anticipate, just one point of interest, we'll start our roadshows into China for the leisure markets and for the tour and travel business in September, so that's really a progressive development and build that over time. We understand and we appreciate that our properties will take time to ramp-up and that we need to make sure that we maintain our cost control that we don't get too carried away, that we don't over staff ourselves on early days, but can build capacity and build volume before we \u2013 that we avoid too many overheads. Sorry, that's a bit long, but I hope that covers what you're interested to hear, Harry.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","It did. I did have just two quick follow ups. The first is, there has been \u2013 I've gotten a couple of questions on whether or not you will entertain the idea of a partial opening?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","We obviously want to hype as much as we possibly can and if everything was up to our standard and we thought that we could drive sufficient volumes to support it, we would open everything, but we're pragmatic. Our target is to get everything as far as we can. We've previously announced that The Mansion product would be delayed, but in terms of all of our other facilities, we're hoping to be able to make the decision operationally whether we're comfortable to get to support everything. At this moment, room inventory, the rooms are looking pretty good, we're punching all those things through. So, we would like to have as much online as we possibly can, but openings are always challenging, We're pragmatic enough to know that we just work to what we know we are able to present the best image of our brand and our product on day one.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","And last question is, can you narrow for us the projected timing of the opening?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","I think Jim was pretty clear that that within the next two or three months, we certainly will be opening, we're aiming for that. Construction is going well. Our manning is going well. And we all understand, however, that we do have to follow the regulatory procedures laid out by the government and at the end of the day once that's all been completed, then we'll get our permits to operate. But we're all pretty comfortable. We're ready to go as soon as we can get that permitting in place.","Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay, very good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Jim, maybe to build on the whole kind of discussion around RevPAR and some of the tweaks in mix, so just wondering if you or someone can elaborate a little bit more on sort of a little bit more specifically, what exactly are you doing in terms of these tweaks? Is it more channel-related, meaning sort of optimization of OTA versus direct book versus other things, and cutting down on customer acquisition costs or is it more comp and cash mix? And maybe just elaborating on any of the tools that you are using to make some of those changes? That'd be really helpful.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. I'll turn it over to Corey for that.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Shaun, as part of our continuous improvement, one of the things we've really focused on is identifying our channels and then, really doing an in-depth study on the profitability of those channels. All of our channels and our partners are very important to us. But there are certain channels that are actually making a lot less profit, sometimes, anywhere from 20% to 50% less than other channels. So, it's been more of a channel switch than anything else. On the casino side, we continue to use our M life database and the regional database. But what we've been able to see is, we have been able to for the first time in a while actually shift some of that lower-end channel into our own transient database. So, that's something that, I think, when we looked at it going into the year and when we made that decision, we felt the demand for Las Vegas was really solid and if there was a time to do it, with the dynamics, this was the right time to do it.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And Corey, is there a software or tools or \u2013 we know there are some optimization things you're using and rolled out across the enterprise, what phase are we in on that that's kind of \u2013 any color there?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","We're at the beginning stage, and when I say that I'm pretty critical of ourselves. I think there is a lot more opportunities to maximize with tools and tap artificial intelligence, and things like that. So, I'm pretty excited about what the future has to bring in this area.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, I'd just add to that part, Corey. Obviously, we are well aware of the CRM softwares that are out there, salesforce.com being one that Caesars is using, and other companies have different techniques. We have our own CRM. It's going to evolve and one of the things that has been a benefit of the Borgata acquisition has been \u2013 they've had a very strong CRM process in place at Borgata. And we're taking that learning, and Tom Ballance, who is now in corporate with us, is leading the team with Anton Nikodemus and a variety of our best leaders here, including Marcus Glover, who is going to be running Borgata to make it a company-wide decision on improving analytics, and artificial intelligences and CRM. But that's exactly what Corey is referring to by changing the channels on the non-gaming side this year, and being able to do more process, marketing on the gaming side. We've been able to increase our revenue per occupied room, which is why you see a really good slot handle, and you see good table volume, it would have been more evident if we had just held normally, but even with lower hold, it benefited us.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Maybe on the capital allocation front, what is the latest progress in pursuing some of the various asset sales that you've alluded to in the past, whether it's non-core like CityCenter, National Harbor, and where does MGP fit in?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","So thank you. It's a good way to kind of step back and look at what we're trying to accomplish here. One is obviously to drive free cash flow and I will get into that more. But certainly, we're accelerating our free cash flow generation in our operations this year versus last and we think next year significantly more. But adding to free cash flow comes the other levers that we have.","One of the major levers that we have is MGP. We were really clear when we brought MGP public a couple Aprils ago that National Harbor which has a ROFO, it would be an asset that we would like to transact with, with MGP. We also said that we'd like to have a few quarters under National Harbor's belt before we entered into those negotiations. Well, we have a few quarters under our belt right now, so I would think that it would be logical to assume that a transaction would be more in the near term than the long term between MGM and MGP. That, if done properly, and we expect it would if we do it, would have a profoundly positive impact on MGM Resorts in terms of its liquidity and its cash and squarely fits with the overall arching belief that we need to return cash to our shareholders.","MGP is out on the prowl on a variety of other transactions, some of which will not involve MGM, but others very likely could. And recall that we're opening up Springfield, Massachusetts, next year, I think in September or August and that obviously is a candidate for MGP as well. The other lever that we have is clearly through asset sales. There has been a significant level of interest on The Strip right now. There is really strong chatter around the Fontainebleau being sold with a hotel flag that will be put on it. We're not involved, to be clear. But that would be a good sign for the market, if people are willing to invest a lot of money to try to bring that property to life. And we own assets as well. We own Circus Circus. We own the Mandarin at CityCenter and several other assets that we always look to find out what we should do in terms of our best interests.","In terms of other levers that we have, clearly CityCenter itself with another record quarter is generating a significant amount of cash. We will continue to return that cash to its shareholders, Infinity World and MGM. And of course, once we open up in Cotai, MGM China should turn into a significant free cash flow generator beginning next year. So, the levers that we have in front of us that we're constantly trying to maximize are number one, free cash because our CapEx is going to roll over and be very minimal going forward; two, asset sales or other ways of monetizing assets; three, dividends from our ventures.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, that's all. I'll help I guess as a follow-up, do you think about allocating cash proceeds from asset sales differently than operational cash flow, and more broadly, do your priorities change as that cash flow inflects? Maybe any type of development projects that you can see out there that we should be thinking about.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","That's a good question that hasn't been asked of us before. But yes, I feel like if there is \u2013 I got to talk to our board about this \u2013 but if there is a significant one-time event that would generate a tremendous amount of cash to MGM Resorts, that would impact our decision making versus free cash flow that is steadily and rapidly growing. And yes, we've been very clear on capital allocation and shareholder returns. We started with dividends, quarterly dividends. We expect that we'll be able to increase our quarterly dividend over time. But that share repurchase also will be part of our discussion at the board level. And if we have a significant windfall, which I think we will, one or two of them, over the next couple years, we'd be more immediate in our transferring that windfall to shareholders than rapidly growing free cash flow.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Good luck in the back half.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone, good morning. Corey, if I could, just you spoke a lot about kind of the continuous improvement and the mix that you're trying to kind of utilize to drive that improved profitability using more of those improved channels. If you could just kind of maybe silo stuff for us in terms of what the mix is today, be it with group, convention, leisure, transient, casino, et cetera, and kind of what the optimal for profitability based on what you guys have identified would be as we go forward?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, Carlo, I don't think we've really gone into mix that much. Obviously, the convention is our base, and we build off of that. The we use some of the other channels to also help build the base and yield from there. The goal would be really to, if we could keep shifting a few percent into the transient probably from the leisure base, that would be where we could gain the most profitability. And I think we're starting to see that happen probably for the first time since probably before the recession that we've been able to actually make that change happen.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, and I think maybe, I don't want to cut you off, Dan, but I think that that's exactly right. Because our convention mix is growing and becoming more profitable to us and because we see a strong convention calendar in 2018 and 2019, and because we're expanding our convention facilities right now at Aria and at MGM, and you weave that together with the expansion already at Mandalay that sets up a much stronger foundation for us to look at the rest of our rooms.","From the rest of our rooms' perspective, we're becoming more intelligent about how we can shift leisure into transient. And that requires software that we're deploying. It requires a different philosophy which we're also deploying, but it also is as a result of the fact that we're more confident in our overall occupancies than before. And that's I guess the point that should be always made is that all of us out here, our competitors and ourselves, run these resorts at mid 90s occupancy.","That's why RevPARs is so misleading. It's not about occupying the buildings. It's about occupying the buildings in a way that will generate the most profit to the resorts, not just to the hotel department of the resorts. The combination of this and the loyalty CRM marketing that's going to have an impact \u2013 increasing impact on the casino side is going to provide a revenue and profit growth that we did not anticipate when we started this about a year ago.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And the one area where we have given pretty good direction is the convention side. We are around that 19%. With the additional space, if we now grew an extra 1%, it would really help on yielding the base. But I think that's about where we want to be in that area.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Of course. Thank you, guys. That's helpful. And then, Jim, you mentioned earlier some commentary around Fontainebleau. It sounds like something is closer obviously with that asset. Just from your experience and what you guys know about kind of the asset, it's current state, how long do you imagine it would take for someone to come in and get that asset viable and kind of up and running?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I guess three years, 2.5 half years is the earliest, but I would say three years. And I guess the point I'd make. I love this town. We don't have as many rumors in Las Vegas as Macau, but we do hold our own that it would be more hotel centric than anything else. And obviously, up near a expanding and upgraded convention center, that would be very positive for the town and positive for Northern properties like Mirage and Circus Circus, of course. And I think that knowing what we know about our own portfolio, the level of interest we're getting on assets that are not already owned by MGP is very high. And we're a transactional company, and so I do expect that there will be opportunities, like we did with Crystals opportunistically to sell that asset at very attractive cap rate, I think there'll be other opportunities to monetize without changing the overall trajectory of what we're trying to accomplish here.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Just in terms of the gaming environment in Vegas, in the first quarter I think table volumes dropped 2%, slot volumes were flat this quarter. Table drop is down 3.5% and slot volumes are up 3.5%. So can you just talk about how the general environment is for gaming volumes? Thanks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Do you want to start, Corey, or do you want me to go?","Unknown Speaker","Thomas, actually if you kind of look at our entire enterprise, including Aria, our table game volumes were actually flattish to slightly up so.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think we're really happy where our volumes are coming off really a monster quarter the year before. When we look at our business, our international business is actually up, led by Far East, which is up very nicely, little bit offset by Latin, but most of our premium play comes from the Far East. The national side was up against a very tough comparison. So that would be down a little bit, but we're expecting to recover a lot of that because we expect to see many of those players that we know weren't here for the second quarter, we expect to see them in about a month.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, I mean that's obviously yes. One, I think we should start talking about Aria as part of our family more. I mean people look at Aria is like a separate than the rest of our portfolio. But we run Aria as we run any other property in terms of moving a business around and having customers make their decision. So that I think Cathy's point is a good one. But we anticipated a tough comp. That's why we had said in the second quarter that our gaming revenue is like going to down. We didn't anticipate 500 basis-point decrease in hold year-over-year.","But we're going to have a tremendous amount of gaming volume coming in, in August. If people don't understand the impact on fights and this is not just a fight but a spectacle, just kind of watch TV. We've had a lot of people that said we're coming in August that did not come in June or July. They're coming in August and that will help. So I think that our feeling about gaming volumes here in town in terms of our own and our competitors is quite solid, particularly on the Far East side. And the standpoint of looking at what drivers that are events, and to have two fights in one quarter is something we've never had before. So we're hopeful that that has a gaming impact that we could be proud of. I think it will.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, now that we're in the second half of 2017, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about 2018 on the Strip? Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. I'll start and then anyone can jump in. One is our convention business looks like it will be at least as good, if it not better, in '18 versus '17. That's the base that I was referring to, and it's the manifestation of some conventions that I was alluding to before that have shifted from '17 into '18 as some of the big companies have consolidated some of their convention business. That's going to actually help us in '18. That's the first point.","Second point is we'll have the benefit of the expansions of our conference facilities at Aria and emerging at MGM. That certainly helps captures much of the incremental business as we can.","Thirdly, we're converting Monte Carlo, which has been at our lower end of our RevPAR, our ADR spectrum into Park MGM and NoMad, which will be at the upper end of our ADR spectrum in our portfolio. That will have a very, I think, nice impact not only on that resort but the neighborhood and we own the neighborhood. And so driving higher ADRs in New York, New York, driving better mix throughout that campus will be effective.","The third, I would not ignore the fact that we're having our first professional sports team start in a couple months. The Golden Knights will be playing later this year throughout early '18, which sets up for very strong sports calendars that we expect to have in '18 and beyond, increasing sporting events to Las Vegas, whether it's more college, and\/or more pros will have a big impact on the market. And we should do better than most on that. The airlines are \u2013 they're talking positively about '18 in terms of coming into McCarran, and the convention center itself, the Las Vegas Convention Center is also talking about a better year. So those are some of the macros that I know. I don't if you have any others?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yes. Just a few maybe offsets are ConAgra won't be in ...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Good point. Good point.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","...there is a shift of CES about a week, which we'll have a little bit of an impact because usually it's right after New Year's. But in general, we have strategies to attack both of those situations.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","That was a good point, Corey. Anything else, Dan, on that?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","No, I'm afraid not.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just on the margin front, are we still feeling good about the margin, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, I mean, we're actually \u2013 to be clear, we had said, what was our prior guidance?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","50 basis points to 100 basis points.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","50 basis points to 100 basis points, that's 25 basis points higher now. We feel like we know and you've seen it in the current quarter or currently reported quarter, our margins are ahead of pace. I think they will remain ahead of pace. And remember, in Las Vegas, I said it earlier, but every 1% increase in margin in Las Vegas is $14 million of profit. So we expect margins to continue to grow and to be up again in '18, and our target is to get into the mid 30s in terms of margin, and obviously we think we're well on our way there.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And remember that margin growth is on top of the disruption we're experiencing at Monte Carlo. So we're fighting through that and still growing margins.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And I think we always will, Dan. I mean I think the point that we've made to folks is that when you own 42,000 hotel rooms here and you're driving this business for cash flow and to try to increase revenues going forward, you're going to, within the CapEx contours that we've stated, which we would reaffirm, we're able to reposition properties within a couple year period of time as we straddle years in terms of CapEx to dramatically increase profitability. It does have an impact in the near term at the property itself, like it is at Monte Carlo, but we have the benefit of having 10 resorts out here. And so we feel like we can drive revenue, margin growth, profitability even when one property is undergoing this type of transformation.","And it won't be the last one we do. If we are successful in converting Monte Carlo to Park MGM as we expect and get the kind of returns on investment that are going to be outsized relative to other investments that we can make, we'll look at another property to tackle in the out years. And so I think that's part of portfolio management in terms of trying to drive revenue, profitability, and long-term growth while you are focusing on free cash.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. I wanted to ask just thinking about convention mix and things. And there was a comment that maybe Dan had made about like 19% mix, that maybe that's sort of kind of where you want to be. So is the idea that you are not necessarily going to grow convention mix next year? And I'm just wondering if you have an idea of how many conventions Las Vegas maybe sort of borrowed from the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco this year since that's like fully closed in Q3 and partially closed for the full year? Just that there's a benefit this year, but maybe they move back when that reopens next year.","And then just also to clarify your comments about the distribution channel shift, is it just sort of comping more rooms to gaming customers? Because you mentioned shifting some percentage into transient from leisure, but that I would think would actually raise RevPAR. So I'm trying to think about what channel shift would make RevPAR, would dampen it, to use your words. And is that just sort of comping more rooms to the casino channel? So thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. There are a bunch in there. We can all jump in in different ones. One is, we usually don't borrow conventions, we steal and keep them. And I think it unlikely that we'll lose anything back to the Moscone Center. In fact, we haven't so far. So, we'll see. But once people get here and they see the value proposition, and they see the delegation attendance up 20%, 30% versus the other host city, they tend to only, generally do not leave, but we'll see. The 19% reflects the fact CON\/AGG is not here next year, so actually that we would say would be a very good outcome for our company and it's not the ceiling to it, it's just what our projection is at this point in time because of what we see on the books and the fact, we're expanding our convention facilities. You want to take the RevPAR one Corey or Dan?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Sure, so in the second quarter, our convention mix was actually down a little bit, and so that at a higher rate compared to the business that replaced it would have an impact on rate. We were actually down a little bit in casino room nights for the quarter. That was also purposely done. We once again in maximizing profitability, we took the lower end of that database and we changed the way we reinvest in them, but that would be the color of why the rate would have been down a little bit from that perspective.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And so the ADR, I mean, the RevPAR connection between RevPAR, what Robin was asking and profitability, you want to explain that? I mean, it's the margin on the incremental non-gaming room is higher because of our channel shift.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Even the gaming room plus the shift alone has probably got anywhere from a 25% to 50% profitability improvement by shifting out of those lower profitability channels. So, that's why I think you start seeing the increase in margin. That rate probably didn't replace the convention rate that we lost for the quarter.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Okay. And also these customers, not only gaming, but these customers spend a lot more money in entertainment, whether it's in our nightlife or food and beverage, our shows in general. They're becoming more sports oriented which is a focus of ours, event driven, park theater, so it's not only improving the gaming side without having \u2013 our comp levels haven't changed by the way, Robin, on that point, but it's improving our non-gaming non-hotel revenue","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","And it's also Robin being disciplined in the approach, right, because as Jim mentioned earlier, those two weeks in June two years ago, we may have reacted differently based on the information we had at hand. So, instead of chasing that non-profitable business in that softer two-week period, we stuck to our guns and as you saw in our ADRs, they were all up across The Strip except for Monte Carlo, and didn't go chase kind of that lower end business in that short time period, which is really in those lower end channels that to Corey's point, is where you find that really not profitable piece of business.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Katz with Telsey Group. Please go ahead.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi, good morning, all. It's not my actual question, but I am curious whether if a fight only last 45 seconds, do people gamble more or less?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","It depends on who won.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Everyone. I really wanted to ask about Borgata, and I want to make sure that I'm not missing something in that $101 million EBITDA number. As I recall the best year that that property had historically was a little over $200 million. The margin seems fairly high. Is there something in that $101 million that we should be backing out and what can we reasonably expect out of that property going forward?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, David, this is Dan. The quarter, Borgata benefited from a one-time property tax settlement. It was about $36 million. So, excluding that number, it was about $65 million of true operating profit from the core business. So, that is a one-time item in the quarter. You're right, Borgata I think at its peak did about $250 million-ish plus or minus in terms of overall EBITDA when it was part of the joint venture. But the team there has done an extraordinary job, both in the marketplace and working with our corporate team in integrating Borgata. As you saw in the release, in mid-June, we just brought them online and M life, which I think is going to be a big positive for both of them and the M life program. So we continue to expect some big things out of Borgata and that property going forward.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And what I would add, David, the other thing we did when we came in is we took our profit growth plan initiatives and applied a lot of those to Borgata and we have seen some benefit from those also.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Care to call it early innings?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","I'd say that's fair.","David Brian Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay. Good enough. Thank you very much.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, David.","Unknown Speaker","We'll take the last question. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie, please go ahead.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me on Macau, so either for Grant or anyone in Las Vegas. How should we think about the table application process as we near the opening of COTAI. I think we've learned a lot over the last year that the government wants something new and diversification of offerings which you guys are offering in the product, but how do you think about that and if you don't get your request, how should we think about some table shifts? Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I'll start, maybe Grant, if in case Grant is asleep. We have not made our...","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Oh, I'm not sleep. Go ahead.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","All right. I knew it. Okay. We've not made our submission yet in terms of tables. That is something you do towards the end of the process. We have focused a lot and you can see it on in our investor deck on the nongaming components to COTAI, which we believe are transformational in that market. It's very unique, particularly on the entertainment side, which we are noted for. All that plays into the government's decision around table allocations and we're going to do the best we can on that and based on what we get, Grant will decide how to move tables around.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks very much, Jim.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Okay. You're welcome. So I just like to wrap up and say thank you for joining us. I'm proud of the effort in the second quarter in terms of executing on our plan. We're excited about the current quarter, having the second biggest fight of all time, it's a kind of fun. I'm excited about how in shape Mayweather is, I saw him in his gym a couple of nights ago, and I'm excited about what we have happening in the second half of the year.","We're very clear on our direction here at the company in terms of maximizing our free cash flow, our capital expenditures are defined and declining and are unchanged from what we discussed with our community several times. We believe that results in significant growth in free cash and we intend to return that free cash to our shareholders.","We have multiple levers ahead of us and some of them are imminent and that will enhance the overall return on capital to our shareholders as it relates to transactions that we talked about today. National Harbor couldn't be doing better from our perspective and is perfectly positioned to ultimately be owned by MGP. CityCenter is performing at an outstanding level, and also, is well-positioned to return more capital to its owners and perhaps provide more asset opportunities in terms of disposition. Macau is right around the corner in terms of the opening of COTAI and the impact of having such a beautiful property that we think will be very successful, the impact that will have to the MGM China shareholders.","We will continue to build the company for the long-term but continue to reward our shareholders throughout this journey, and we will do so in the ways that have articulated. And I think that that will increase the value of the enterprise significantly over time.","And with that, I'd like say thank you very much for joining us today. We're excited about the back half of the year and into 2018 and beyond. And as always, we're ready to take any of your questions. So, please give us a call.

Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bobby Baldwin, Chief Design and Construction Officer of MGM Resorts International and President and CEO of CityCenter; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings, Limited. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, thank you, Mackenzie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, just a few disclaimers here. The call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and a replay of the call will be made available on our website. We furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning as well.","Before getting started, on this call we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website. Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report our results today. This is the best first quarter we've had in 5 years. We've made broad sweeping progress on many fronts. Our marketing efforts are paying off. We are growing revenues, increasing our share and building loyalty. Our capital investments in room remodels, entertainment and F&B are generating attractive returns. We have, of course, strengthened our technology systems and have improved practices leading to the greater efficiencies that you see.","During the first quarter, MGM reported net revenues up 3%. Property cash flows grew 20%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business. We're also very pleased to report record results from CityCenter, nearly tripling its profit. We also had record results at MGM China.","Our wholly owned domestic resorts results were driven by Las Vegas, where EBITDA grew 18% year-over-year. Visitation to Las Vegas remains strong, and macro trends are improving here, helping to drive the recovery. Growth in Las Vegas was somewhat offset by our regional properties, which faced difficult comparisons, as well as some of the early headwinds that have been well previewed in the marketplace. That being said, MGM Detroit and Beau Rivage remain market share leaders, and we are finding success in cross-marketing our Las Vegas properties to our regional customers. It appears to us that Las Vegas, the market hit hardest by the recession, is nicely recovering and that its performance will likely outstrip the existing regional markets for the foreseeable future.","We continue to be hard at work to build the future of our business through development opportunities as there are key strategic investments that we see as attractive. Since our last earnings call, we have broken ground on MGM Cotai. Our site work is advancing at an accelerated pace, and we continue to be on track for a first half of 2016 opening date.","In Maryland, we have been preparing our RFP for Prince George's County, which we will submit by the end of next week. We look forward to that progress and process and sharing more details on this exciting project to you in the future.","In Massachusetts, we are honored by Mayor Sarno's confidence in selecting MGM to bring a world-class urban resort to Springfield. This is an important milestone in the process as the project now seeks city council approval, after which a referendum is possible as early as July and then, ultimately, we will compete at the state level for the Western region license.","In Toronto, we and our partner, Cadillac Fairview, believe in our vision for an integrated resort in Toronto, and we continue to work towards that development opportunity.","And back here in Las Vegas, we recently announced plans to dramatically enhance the experience and offerings with an outdoor retail and restaurant park at 2 of our iconic resorts, Monte Carlo and New York-New York. Hershey's, sbe and Shake Shack are already signed up to be anchor tenants in this project. We expect to be announcing further details about these projects very, very soon.","We plan on integrating this outdoor park with our recently announced plans for a new world-class arena in partnership with AEG. This new 20,000-seat arena will be situated behind Monte Carlo and New York-New York and is planned to open in 2016. Our goal for the arena is to drive additional large events to Las Vegas, which further increases visitation and spend at our properties.","I am pleased with our results for the first quarter and believe that we are well positioned for 2013. This is the beginning of a new era for MGM Resorts.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan D'Arrigo to talk about our operating results.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thank you, Jim. Our strong first quarter results were led by increased margins at our wholly owned domestic resorts, which increased by over 250 basis points year-over-year, driven by a 335 basis point increase at our Las Vegas Strip properties.","EBITDA on the Strip was driven by our luxury properties, which had a combined increase of 27% year-over-year, compared to a decrease of 1% at are non-luxury Strip properties. Our luxury properties continue to lead the way in the market, driven by increased convention room nights and the continued success of the high-end casino business.","In our casino business, we are seeing the benefits of all the strategic initiatives we've put in place throughout last year. Organizational changes were made to streamline the international and national marketing teams to better service our customers and drive profitability. This was reflected in the first quarter as our Strip properties, including ARIA, had a record quarter in both international table games volume and win.","M life has been focused on continuing to enhance the customer experience and driving regional play to the Strip. The more we learn about our customers, the more effective we are at marketing the right programs to them. Our Baccarat -- non-Baccarat table game win on the Strip, including ARIA, increased by 24%, and slot revenues grew by 4%.","Room revenues and ADRs increased by about 2% in the quarter. While occupancy was down slightly, occupied room nights increased by 1% at our Strip properties as the remodeled rooms at the MGM Grand are now online. Recall that for the first 3 quarters of 2012, we had approximately 70,000 room nights off-line per quarter at the MGM Grand due to the room remodel program. We are seeing strong returns on our room remodel investments, as evidenced by Bellagio and MGM Grand, where we were able to maintain high occupancy levels and drive increased room rates.","Our convention mix increased slightly, despite citywide convention attendees being down. And looking forward at the second quarter, we expect a strong convention calendar, which will drive REVPAR to be up approximately 2% year-over-year.","Shifting over to the balance sheet and to help you with some of your modeling. On April 1, we repaid $462 million in outstanding principal amounts of senior notes at their maturity. And excluding MGM China and pro forma for this paydown, we currently have approximately $1.2 billion in available liquidity, including our excess cash and capacity under our revolver. Excluding MGM China, our current debt level is approximately $12.6 billion.","At the end of the first quarter, MGM China had cash of approximately $565 million, debt of roughly $553 million and an adjusted leverage ratio of less than 1, based on their trailing 12-month EBITDA. MGM China in March paid a $500 million dividend, of which $255 million was retained by MGM Resorts and $245 million was distributed to all other shareholders. MGM China also put in place a regular dividend distribution policy for up to 35% of its annual profits to be paid semiannually. The board will also consider, going forward, special dividends from time to time.","CityCenter has approximately $1.85 billion in outstanding senior notes and excess cash of approximately $240 million. In addition, CityCenter has approximately $200 million in cash from condo proceeds, which includes the recent receipt of approximately $40 million in net proceeds from the sale of our mortgage loan notes, which occurred here in April. CityCenter's credit profile has made tremendous progress with net debt of approximately $1.5 billion and LTM EBITDA from resort operations are roughly $290 million. CityCenter's overall leverage is just above 5x. Tremendous progress in the improvement of the capital structure at that joint venture.","Our first quarter CapEx was approximately $53 million at our wholly owned domestic resorts and roughly $16 million at MGM Macau. MGM China spent an additional $28 million on MGM Cotai during the first quarter. Our wholly owned domestic CapEx guidance for the year remains at roughly $350 million, and that includes the amounts, for this year, of the recently announced projects at Monte Carlo and New York-New York.","We expect corporate expense to continue to be in the $40 million to $45 million range per quarter, and our stock compensation and depreciation expense in the second quarter is estimated to be consistent with the first quarter. We estimate that our gross interest expense for the second quarter will be approximately $220 million, which includes about $7 million in interest in MGM China and $8 million in noncash amortization expense.","With that, I'll turn it over to Bobby Baldwin to talk more about CityCenter.","Robert H. Baldwin","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We're excited to report that in the first quarter of 2013, CityCenter achieved record EBITDA for the -- from the resort operations of $93 million. ARIA led the way with EBITDA of $78 million, a major improvement compared to the first quarter of 2012 where they earned $19 million EBITDA. We saw a significant increase in table games volume, led by a very strong international play associated with the Chinese New Year's.","In the first quarter, ARIA held 28% compared to 16% in the prior year period. While ARIA is still a new property and has limited operating history, if you compare ARIA's hold during the quarter to its trailing 24-month average, then ARIA's hold was positively impacted by $9 million in the quarter. Slot revenue increased 4% compared to last year's first quarter.","REVPAR at ARIA increased 5%, driven by a 2% ADR increase and an increase in occupancy. Convention room nights as a percentage of mix increased by 3 percentage points year-over-year.","We continued to see growth in the food and beverage with a very strong quarter in catering and banquets, driven by growth in the convention segment and recent dining enhancements to the property, such as Javier's Mexican restaurant. Overall, food and beverage EBITDA at ARIA increased 20% year-over-year in the quarter.","In February, we received notice from Forbes Travel Guide that ARIA's Sky Suites earned the prestigious Five-Star award, joining an elite class of resorts. ARIA's Sky Suites, along with the MGM Grand's Skylofts and Mandarin Oriental at CityCenter, are the only 3 properties in Las Vegas to earn both the AAA Five Diamond and Forbes Five-Star ratings. We're very proud of all the employees for achieving these amazing accomplishments.","Vdara's EBITDA continues to improve as occupancy grows and is now approximately 86%. We are also finalizing construction plans to convert the Silk Road restaurant space into approximately 5,000 square feet of additional meeting and convention space, and we expect this to drive both occupancy and rate, with completion scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year.","Crystals' EBITDA also increased 20% year-over-year, driven by high rents and new store openings. During the quarter, we signed a new lease for a Bobby Flay's Burger Palace, which will open later this year on the Las Vegas Strip as part of the Crystals complex. Additionally, we opened the Las Vegas Strip's Starbucks mid-March and also another Starbucks at the former Pods location inside Crystals in April.","And this concludes my report, and I'll turn it over to you, Grant Bowie.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Bobby. And again, good morning, and for the Asian listeners, good evening. For the first quarter, MGM China had another record net revenues of some $748 million. This was up 6% year-over-year. In terms of property EBITDA, we had our best quarter ever at $193 million, excluding the branding fee of $13 million. EBITDA margin improved to 26.2% from 25.4% a year ago due to a higher contribution from our main floor business, which now represents 65% of our EBITDA.","Our overall VIP win rate for the quarter was approximately 2.8%, plus the normalized hold, with lower junket hold being offset by higher in-house VIP hold. Junket turnover was a property record with an almost 15% year-on-year growth. Volume increased notably and came mostly from our top-tiered junket operators. We're seeing success from our level 2 VIP gaming floor expansion, which opened last September, and the first quarter in-house VIP business increased volumes by 13% year-over-year.","We also had a record quarter in our main floor table games with volume up 7% and revenues up 26% year-on-year. We're encouraged to see not only our premium areas, such as our Supreme and Platinum Lounges continue to perform well, but also our general main floor product produced record results. Now slot handle increased 28% during the quarter, driven by very strong play during our Chinese New Year.","As Jim mentioned, we broke ground on MGM Cotai in February, and the pace of work continues to increase. We have completed our general contractor tender process and are finalizing the appointment of this very important partner for our project. Our Cotai project will have 1,600 rooms, 2,500 slots and up to 500 tables. The project will feature over 85% of gross floor area of non-gaming offerings, including restaurants, retail and entertainment attractions, as well as foundation work will also have been included for future expansion, and remains on schedule for opening in the first half of 2016.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Grant. Here in Las Vegas, we're off to a good start in the quarter, and we're excited about a flurry of events and openings in the coming months. The spectacular 80,000 square foot restaurant lounge and night club, Hakkasan, has just opened to big crowds at the MGM Grand, just in time for the Floyd Mayweather fight this weekend and the Rolling Stones next weekend.","Mandalay Bay is eagerly awaiting the opening of the Michael Jackson One show by Cirque du Soleil and a new nightclub, LIGHT, and a dayclub, Daylight, both opening around Memorial Day weekend. Mandalay Bay, as you may remember, has been without a show or a club for 2 years. And as history tells us, we should know what to expect when they do open for Mandalay.","Luxor will be the new home of Jabbawockeez starting this month. And out in June, we host Beyonce, Justin Bieber and Pitbull.","The economy here is improving. Housing is recovering, and our business and leisure customers are responding with higher spending. We have seen tangible benefits in cross-marketing to our select regional markets, and we are excited about our future development opportunities. We always remind ourselves that this economy is hard to predict. That, of course, always tempers our enthusiasm. But we're off to a good start, and we predict good things for the company in the future.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, based on your comments, it sounded like this quarter's results could be interpreted as being an inflection point for the Las Vegas Strip. Do you think that's the right way to interpret your prepared remarks?","James Joseph Murren","Well, I think that -- we knew the first quarter was going to be tough citywides here, and we talked about that on our last call. And we did a bit better than we expected in the first quarter in the convention side in the year for the year, which helped us a little bit on the REVPAR side. We always knew the second quarter would be a little bit easier comp. But I have to just caution everybody that we just -- we've had headshakes in this economy before, so we -- and the scars of the recession have not fully healed. But I could tell you that what we're doing is working. The cost containment is clear. Our FTEs are flat year-over-year. Our efficiencies are leading to good expansion in margins. Revenues are building. I think we've picked up some market share. Chinese New Year's, I think, for everyone was very strong up and down the Strip. It was for us, obviously. But I'd have to say that subject to macro trends, which we cannot control, we feel good about Las Vegas, and we know the operating leverage here is very significant if we do get a little help from the broader economy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Grant, you mentioned that, overall VIP hold was normal, lower on the junket side, higher in-house. If we were to normalize VIP hold in both of those segments, can you help us to understand what normalized EBITDA, EBITDA margin would have been?","Grant R. Bowie","I think that what we're really saying is that even the [indiscernible] basically, the result is pretty well consistent with the normalized hold.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And with respect to your commentary about trends here in the 2Q on the Strip, with the 2% REVPAR growth, how do you think about that luxury versus non-luxury? Do we actually see, perhaps, a wider divergence between those 2 segments? Or do you see the lower end benefiting from convention-wise and just more activity overall? That's all for me.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Joe, this is Dan. I think you're still going to see that divergence between the luxury and the non-luxury. As April clearly benefits, with a stronger convention calendar, that will help from a citywide standpoint. It being up a little bit here in the second quarter as projected by the LVCVA, that will help the non-luxury properties, clearly. But the luxury properties are still driving the way, based on their ability to drive that midweek convention business.","James Joseph Murren","And I'd just to add to Dan that, I think we've said this before, it's consistent, that the convention business in Las Vegas this year will be okay. It won't be great citywide, but next year is a big year citywide. So when you have the kind of citywides we're predicting in 2014, that'll accrue to the benefit of, of course, Mandalay, but also to the properties that need Mandalay to have that business, Luxor, Excalibur, and also because of the LVCVA Circus Circus. So the cores this year are doing well, but I would expect next year, with the better convention business citywide, that they will do better.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of thoughts on -- maybe on the recap of CityCenter, especially as these Q1 trends show some sustainability, thoughts on how you could change the capital structure there. I know you've also talked about doing something with the mall. Is there an opportunity there? And then I know people have asked this in a couple different ways because it's striking, the difference between high end versus mid-price for your properties just on performance. What are you doing to improve the leisure side of things, Jim? It sounds like on the conference\/convention, you feel that if that strengthens up, then there will be a trickle down into some of the mid-priced. But what can you do on the Friday to Sunday to improve the operating results in these mid-priced properties?","James Joseph Murren","All right, maybe I'll start on -- so first off, it's not a mall. It's too nice to be a mall.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry about that. Sorry.","James Joseph Murren","The Mall in Short Hills, but this is not a mall. And that's just an opportunity. There's -- really, we love Crystals. It's -- there's obviously a great market for retail in the country, particularly very high-end luxury retail. And that's about all we can say at this point, because we really love owning it, but there is obviously a financial opportunity. And then I'll turn it over to you, Dan.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. I think on the recap, Steve, I think there's -- I think at some point in time here in the future, there is going to be an opportunity for CityCenter to relook and recast the debt structure there. The -- there's call dates that start kicking in, in January of next year, and that's going to give us an opportunity to really look at a different capitalization of CityCenter, both in terms of the debt structure itself and a lower interest rate environment that CityCenter will find itself in as we think about that opportunity.","James Joseph Murren","And then, Corey, did you want to add?","Corey I. Sanders","Sure. On the convention side, our -- of course, our leisure properties with significant convention space and mainly sold out in peak season are -- have a much easier time at raising the rates. On the core side, the leisure business is as strong as ever. And actually, one of the third-party providers just even mentioned how strong summer looks, being up over 50%, and I think we're the main benefactor of that. So as citywide grow eventually, we could reduce some of that, but we're using that to fill a lot of those core properties. When you look at the core properties, there's 2 sets of core properties. There's -- really, there's 3. There's Circus on the north. Then you have the south side. But the ones in the middle of the Strip, they're able to drive the rate, because they're in a premium location, and we've really improved the amenities on those properties. So the leisure component is still -- it's very important for those core properties as citywides stay at the level they -- that they're at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to ask, again, back to kind of the operating expense side in Las Vegas. It seems like there's was really good cost control in the quarter. Our mass operating expenses were down about 2% year-on-year despite the revenue growth. So is that level of kind of run rate of cost reduction actually sustainable? And we would've thought that at least with adding in a few more rooms back in for MGM Grand that there might be some natural growth in that. So what are you doing to drive that?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, Shaun, I'll start and Corey will chime in. But clearly, as Jim pointed out earlier, maintaining our FTEs, which is a little more than half of our overall operating costs, is critical to drive the leverage and the flow-through in these units. And so I think it is sustainable in terms of keeping those costs in check. There'll be some moderate increases, we believe, going forward as with everything, from time to time, in commodity prices and different pieces. But I think the teams are viewing up and down each of our properties here in Las Vegas, as well as in our regional properties, and even Grant in Macau are laser focused on containing costs. And when we do see some increases, we're finding ways to mitigate increases with more efficiencies in other areas. So I think, overall, we're comfortable with what we're seeing right now, and there are opportunities to keep expenses in check going forward.","Corey I. Sanders","And what I would add in is we're getting smarter and more intelligent with technology on scheduling, which is an opportunity to refine our scheduling. And the other area that we've gotten a lot better in is the promotional expense on table games and when we hold events, when we don't hold events. Those are, I think, permanent. Every quarter, we're incurring savings that we were incurring last year that we should be able to reduce every quarter this year.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So, Corey, did those really roll out in the fourth quarter and then into the first? Is that kind of the timing behind those initiatives?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. We started -- it's part of the realignment of how we focused on table games that Dan mentioned in his earlier comments. But yes, they started late in the fourth quarter, but really, the first quarter was our first full quarter implementing our new programs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with ISI Group.","Richard A. Hightower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually a question for Dan. And now that you've put up a profitable quarter, I think this is a relevant question. Can you just describe, maybe in terms to help us for modeling purposes, what the tax shield from previous NOLs would be going forward, and how we should think about that?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","It's a good question, because every time we think we have a handle on the -- on our tax situation, it's -- there's always something that changes, given the nature of Macau and the earnings coming out of there and how we treat them from that standpoint. So I think here in the U.S., we do have some NOLs, but they really start to kind of burn off. And so as we move forward from a domestic perspective, we'll be looking at more normalized kind of U.S. tax rates, but that'll be offset by the benefits of Macau. And so I think that's going to be where it gets neutralized from a tax standpoint.","Richard A. Hightower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So maybe no real cash impact on the tax shield there, given the strength in Macau?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. I think that's accurate, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Securities.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two quick questions. Can you give us a sense of how much in Vegas your table volumes were up and -- in the first quarter? And do you expect that level of lift to continue for the balance of the year?","James Joseph Murren","Okay, Harry, we're going to get that for you right now. Go ahead, Corey.","Corey I. Sanders","Our total table volumes were actually down a little bit, Harry.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay.","Corey I. Sanders","But there is -- and that does not include ARIA, by the way. When you include ARIA, they're actually...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","We're -- Harry, when you look at the non-Bacc table game numbers, they were up when you include ARIA and across-the-board here in Las Vegas from that perspective.","Corey I. Sanders","But it's just those numbers.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","All right. And then, Jim, a question for you. It's really kind of a 30,000-foot question for Vegas as a whole. As you look at load factors through McCarran, they're pretty close to historic highs. And I'm just wondering if -- what indicators, if anything, are you getting from McCarran or the airlines themselves about what's going to prompt them lifting airlift into Vegas, which is going to be an important driver of that midweek business going forward?","James Joseph Murren","All right. I'm going to -- we have some good news on the airlines front. And I'll turn it over to -- maybe, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. I mean, I think, Harry, when you look at kind of seat capacity going forward as projected through the summer by McCarran, actual seat capacity is actually projected to be up in those forward-looking months. And just to kind of circle back to your earlier question, Harry, we were up overall, system-wide here in Las Vegas, up about 3% in table game volume.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And that includes ARIA?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Correct.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then going back to the airline question. The seat capacity, do you have a sense of -- can you remind me what sort of lift do you have? And do you have it -- any sense of how it looks international versus domestic?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. Harry, the seat capacities, especially in the summer, is going be up a few percent, which is very positive for us. Anything looking beyond 2 to 3 months is really hard to look at since the airlines are constantly changing their programs. The domestic side is constrained for the obvious reasons of how they're running their business. I think the growth in the airlines will be on the international side. The U.K. keeps adding flights. We believe Copa is very successful, continuing to add flights. WestJet out of Canada is doing very well. We're seeing Mexico and a few other European countries adding flights. So I think as the business travel improves and as the convention business improves, out -- going out towards 2014, you'll start seeing the domestic airlines adding more capacity to the market also.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I know you talked about REVPAR outlook for Q2 being a little bit ahead of Q1. Do you have any thoughts on Q3 at this point? I know your comments last quarter were -- had pretty decent visibility on the 2 quarters out. So just wondering what you were seeing there. And also, I was interested in a comment that -- I think it was Corey that made it during the Q&A there, about promotional events on table games last year that, I guess, will be eliminated this year. Just to get some color on that.","James Joseph Murren","Well, I'll take the REVPAR one, Robin. There's a lot of in the year for the year. There's quite a bit of movement around when you go out beyond the quarter. I think we're best suited to do a quarter-by-quarter forecast. And obviously, as we said, we look a little bit better here in the second quarter than the first. And Corey separately said that a couple of the third-party providers have talked about a strong summer, but I don't think we're prepared to give a REVPAR guidance for the third quarter. And on the second question?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. On the promotional expenses, Robin, what we've done is we've eliminated putting events on top of events. And we've also focused on the profitability of our -- all of our players and understanding what promotions should drive them to the market. And we've been able to eliminate some promotional chips that we were giving in the past.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, I think we announced earlier that Anton Nikodemus, who was the President of Monte Carlo, has assumed the corporate role of Casino Marketing, and he's brought together all the properties. And we have eliminated a lot of the duplicative events that properties were having on top of one another, and also events that are occurring when we don't need to drive events for people. For example, March Madness. We used to have events around March Madness. Well, we know people are going to come for March Madness. We can reduce some of the slot or Baccarat tournaments around that. So it's just being more coordinated and our marketing approach to the customers being more targeted. And we only just started that, really, at the end of last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just quickly on the margin front. Obviously, this is the second quarter in a row you guys have showed some pretty strong Strip margins and nice healthy growth year-over-year. Just before we get ahead of ourselves, I just wanted to maybe try and quantify and bucket how those margins would look if we took the Grand out of the mix and maybe tried to adjust a little bit for the deltas in year-over-year table holds.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, Carlo, I'll try to answer that as best as we can. The Grand benefited in the quarter from hold as they were -- they were probably the biggest benefactor in the quarter within the portfolio on hold, but I don't have the number stripping out. But if you just look at normalizing hold, so to speak, over the periods, our margins here in the Strip would still be up some-80 basis points year-over-year. Remember, we played unlucky last year, and we're through a lower end of the range and better this year. So when you kind of normalize both those factors, you'd still be up some 80-odd basis points year-over-year in margin improvement.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's great, Dan. That's really helpful. And then just really quickly, if I could. On ARIA, I know you guys gave a bunch of metrics. Do you provide gaming revenue year-over-year comparison just for the property?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, we're taking a look at that.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry. And then I'd just ask if I can sneak in one more, just on the labor front. I know some of the labor negotiations are starting up again. Is there anything in there where -- I know some of those deals were done at different times and maybe there's an opportunity here with the latest negotiations. To the extent you're willing to comment on that on a public call, if there's any opportunity there on the margin side on a go-forward basis.","James Joseph Murren","Well, I'll tackle the union negotiations, while Bobby and Chris are looking at ARIA. The -- as you know, on the union side, particularly the culinary, that comes up every 5 years. And historically, we've been very successful in negotiating constructively these contracts. Obviously, the economy is always different, and it's different today than it was last time. Our goal here is to forge an agreement that works together with the union, charting the course together, meeting their needs and the needs of the company and all the members. So we -- we're in the early innings of this game. We're working with them to construct a package that reflects the conditions of this market, the economy that we've talked about as slowly recovering but could be somewhat fragile. So we are working with them on that front. And if history is any guide, we'll come up with a constructive resolution there. Bobby, do you have anything on ARIA?","Robert H. Baldwin","The ARIA question of table games wins, we won $90 million versus $33 million in the comparable quarter in 2012.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Sorry. And the total gaming revenue was up how much at the property?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Total gaming including slots and everything, or just table games?","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. No, total gaming, including slots.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Hold on.","James Joseph Murren","We'll come back with that one. Chris is looking at that.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Your Macau business generates a lot of free cash flow, and leverage looks to be low, even through the Cotai development period. Do you think you have an appropriate capital structure in place? Or is there room to adjust that?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, I think -- Tom, this is Dan. We do have the appropriate capital structure in place. And that balance sheet at MGM China provides us a lot of flexibility going forward to not only carry out MGM China's development plans and growth strategies, but also to continue to look towards rewarding our shareholders back. And that's evidenced by the dividend policy we put in place. And the last 2, if it's any example, the special dividends that have been returning capital to shareholders. So I think if we're all right, that's going to continue to bear fruit for the shareholders and allow MGM China to grow going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Grant Govertsen from Union Gaming.","Grant Govertsen - Union Gaming Research, LLC","Grant, question on Macau. Obviously, you've got a very premium operation and, as we saw, mass market in slots this quarter with win growing faster than drop. I suppose that's probably due to the premium segment. But, Grant, could you give us a little bit more color on what's driving the mass in slots right now? Is it more on the premium side or the NAS [ph] mass side?","Grant R. Bowie","I think the key issue is that what we've indicated last time is we -- we've had really strong growth in our premium. And I think as you've heard on the calls from most of the other concessionary companies, everyone has a focus on that. So what we've been doing is continuing to build out the mid-mass, which we know and we've actually seen to get some depth and some -- and development and growth in that area. So as we try to do all the time, we try to balance things up as effectively as we can so that we don't become overexposed to any component of the market. So for us, it's continued development of our existing programs from our premium mass business and then continued reinvestment and investment in building the depth of that marketplace in the general mass areas.","Grant Govertsen - Union Gaming Research, LLC","Great. And I know it's early, but how has the reception been on the new aquariums -- the aquarium project in LaPlata [ph]?","Grant R. Bowie","Great. It was very difficult to walk through there the last 2 days. So that's -- those attractions, as we bring into the summer, as we were able to demonstrate last year, generate higher quality traffic into the property. And that's certainly been a significant advantage for us as we continue to want to build through-traffic and, more importantly, once we get the visitors in, convert them to customers.","James Joseph Murren","Yes. And while we have a break here for a second. I think we have a number we want to give you on ARIA.","Robert H. Baldwin","Yes, the total gaming revenue was $130 million this quarter versus $71 million in 2012.","James Joseph Murren","Great. Thank you, Bobby.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Berliner with JPMorgan.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to, I guess, focus on CityCenter. Dan, can you review with us, I think you said you monetized some of the receivables. And I just wanted to know how much did that generate. If you can give any sort of ballpark, and if we could see more monetization of those going forward.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, that was the -- that was roughly about $40 million in net proceeds that we received in April, and that was all the mortgage notes that CityCenter had on its books. So we're officially out of the mortgage note business at CityCenter. So going forward, the opportunity really on the residential is the remaining inventory that's left pretty much at Mandarin, and there's about 10 or a dozen Veer penthouse suites that we still own. So the residential inventory has really been skinnied down to the remaining Mandarin units.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And are you seeing any pickup with the improvement in the housing market on the residential inventory?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","No, we actually have -- I'll kick it over to Bobby. But we've actually seen in the last few months some pickup, particularly in the remaining Mandarin inventory, in terms of sales.","Robert H. Baldwin","So yes, we've seen the market strengthen here in Las Vegas, particularly at the Mandarin, since that's, as Dan pointed out, our remaining inventory. We sold and closed 5 Mandarin Oriental units in the first quarter of 2013. We did 15 in the month of April.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just 2 other questions for me. Dan, I was wondering if you can update at all on, I guess, your license, your 50% ownership on Borgata. And if you guys can also comment on where are -- your position on online gaming.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Sure. I mean, as we stated previously, our first priority in New Jersey is our reapplication process, and that is underway. We still have the trust arrangement that we're governed under, the trust account. It sits at just over about $130 million in cash in that trust arrangement. So the process is underway in New Jersey, and we will keep you apprised as that continues to unfold going forward. As far as online, do you have...","James Joseph Murren","I'll tackle that, maybe --","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","As best we know.","James Joseph Murren","As best we know. We obviously would still prefer a federal solution here. We've made that point very clear on calls and with the federal government, our electeds and through the AGA and otherwise. The reason, of course, is that a federal solution would have comprehensive law-enforcement controls and consistent regulation. And we haven't completely lost hope on that. There is always a chance that, that could occur. But in the meantime, as you know, state by state by state, legislators are -- and governors are passing laws, and we will participate in that as well, whether it's in Nevada, New Jersey or elsewhere. And the opportunity will be to have states compact with one another to create the liquidity that is necessary for poker. And our partnership with bwin.party and with Boyd will be a big help to us there. So it's progressing. It's progressing at a state level. It's not the preferable approach, but we think it can be a very profitable business for the gaming industry, if done correctly, even at the state level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon with Macquarie.","Chad Beynon - Macquarie Research","Given your positive comments around the summer or your summer expectations in Vegas and the recent opening of Hakkasan and the new MGM Grand rooms, I'm curious how you're thinking about pricing rates at the property with the new, strong anchor tenants, new rooms and a property that should essentially serve well in the summer months. And then secondly, any type of metrics you could highlight since the nightclub has opened would be helpful as well.","James Joseph Murren","Well, we have -- we're very, very proud of our yield management team here. I have to say that Mica [ph] and the team have done a tremendous job of being very, very intelligent on how we're yielding the whole portfolio of rooms, company-wide, including ARIA. And so I would say that in light of the fact that the third-party providers are very optimistic about the summer, we're hearing that from Expedia particularly, and the fact that we have tremendous capital improvements that are occurring this quarter or already have occurred, Hakkasan, you mentioned, but do not overlook having a Michael Jackson show, a couple nightclubs, dayclub over at Mandalay Bay, particularly for the summer, that's got to help. So I think that we've proven that we can maximize our rate. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves. This is still -- there's a lot of inventory in Las Vegas, a very robust, intense competition. But given what we have done in our properties, remodeling rooms, improving our F&B offerings, adding entertainment, we are picking up some share, and we deserve to get a premium rate in the market. I think that we do, segment by segment, and we'll continue to balance the supply and demand and certainly through the summer.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Coyne with Goldman Sachs.","Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of housekeeping ones. Just update on the Perini litigation. Is that still scheduled for June? And then in Vietnam, I noted that you pulled out of that joint venture there. Just anything to comment there, and is it something you would consider reentering if terms were to change?","Robert H. Baldwin","This is Bobby. On the litigation front, we have a trial date for January 14 in the -- next year.","Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Was that pushed out, or was it originally June? I can't recall.","Robert H. Baldwin","Part of the trial was going to be -- the case was in 2 halves. Half the trial was going to be in June, and half later. The judge has combined the case again, and the entire case will be tried in January.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And as far as, Kevin, on the Vietnam front, we've -- we're in a transition period with ACDL. We're going to part ways here shortly, and we don't have any intentions of revisiting that decision.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue at this time.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Mackenzie. Given that there's no further questions, we'll end the call here, and thank you all for participating.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

After the company's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please note this conference is being recorded. ","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo. Please go ahead.","Dan D'Arrigo","Well, thank you Nicole and good morning everyone and welcome to the MGM Resorts International, fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com and we have furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Federal Securities Laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","During the call we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance. You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in the press release, which is also available on our website. Please also note that our supplemental earnings deck is posted to our website.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mr. Jim Murren. ","Jim Murren ","Well, thank you Dan and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to take a moment to put out strong fourth quarter and full year into a longer term perspective. ","You know last several years MGM has undertaken a really remarkable transformation, aligning all of our brands into one global entertainment brand, driving a disciplined, unified view of strategy, creating and continuing to build one common approach to get service and firmly establishing a clear and unwavering set of values that guide both our behaviors and our contributions to the communities in which we operate. ","These decisions, thoughtfully planned and carefully executed have resulted in a robust and resilient business model and that provides for defensive earnings streams but also creates really strong tailwinds for the further and I would say 2017 proved that out. Despite the clear challenges we had in the fourth quarter, our earnings were relatively well protected and we finished the year strong and we are excited about 2018 as well. ","We had given guidance in the fourth quarter of EBITDA margins down 100 basis points. They are actually down only 30. We\u2019ve given REVPAR guidance of I think down 5% to 7% and the actually outcome was down 4.9%. ","We think that 2018 is going to be a very strong year for our company based on what we see, here in Las Vegas and in Macau and in our regional properties and we\u2019ll start with Macau. Of course we all just got back from there, having just opened a beautiful new resort MGM COTAI February 13 and literally it was just before an important New Year\u2019s, the Lunar New Year.","We think that this property is a game changer in the market, and really in fact for integrated resorts around the world. It\u2019s so breathtakingly unique that everyone is going to want to go into the spectacle. In fact thousands upon thousands already have and to experience a one of a kind environment. You remember that we set out here to design and develop an innovative, integrated resort that would fulfill the requirements of the government to support global tourism and we\u2019ve delivered on that. ","What\u2019s exciting is that the opening event is just the beginning, because we have many catalysts to drive further traffic and profitability to COTAI in this year, including launching our first resident show \u2018Destiny\u2019 which will drive even more mass customers and a lot of buzz around the property, but also of course when we open up our Mansion along with five junket operators to support the VIP business. ","We opened only recently, so the data is early, but I can say that demands for both properties has been strong, both in terms of rooms and in terms of gaming activity. We had not all our rooms available at COTAI for the opening. I think that we had about, what Bill, 900 \u2013 about 900 and they will continue to add on rooms and Grant will get into that in his comments. But we\u2019ll have all the rooms open in the spring. ","And on the finance, we continue see really gratifying loyalty of our customer base there. We obviously finished the year strong driven by both, good Mass business and VIP in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve seen traffic over there and frankly we haven\u2019t seen in quite some time and that\u2019s continued into the New Year. ","And so between the two properties we are excited about the opportunities that they offer us and we think we are very well positioned for the market in terms of the type of product the customer is looking for, and we are confident that we are able to build our market share and command more than our fair share of the market as we have in the past, commensurate with the fact that we have a high quality product in the best management and employees in the business. ","And here in Las Vegas, this is the second time we talked to you since we experienced the great shock to our community in October and yet our fourth quarter materialized as we expected, as we discussed on our last call - in fact it was a touch better. ","And I think that speaks to the power of our brands and the resiliency of our strong and nimble operating model. We have strong analytical horse power here allowing us to understand our business in a real time basis and make more accurate forecasting. The commitment of our people here is really the big story in our relationships and of course the continued recognition that Las Vegas offers an unparalleled suite of experiences for the town that helps keep this market fresh, relevant, exciting, all that we could see in the fourth quarter and certainly into this year. ","Now there is a lot of interest in Las Vegas today, and others are investing in the marketing which we welcome. We know this drives incremental visitors and well better position the city for the further and I have to say was the genius of our Founder, Kirk Kerkorian. You know he thought us to invest in our community, to encourage others to do so and together the destination would grow and MGM would benefit. That\u2019s what he always said to us and that\u2019s still true today and we are very, very excited about the future because of the collective investments that we and others are marking. ","We continue to see and pursue attractive ROI opportunities in this market, reinvesting in our properties to maximizes their full potential and when we do so, we create meaningful new offerings to the city and that drives incremental demand; and of course we\u2019ve achieved this recently with our expansion to the Mandalay Convention Center, our award winning T-Mobile Arena, more recently the convention expansion at ARIA which literally just opened last week and in already getting great feedback in full, and this year we will continue to invest further. ","Obviously more in convention space, the expansion to the MGM Grand which will open up early next year and of course Monte Carlo\u2019s dramatic transformation to Park MGM and NoMad, certainly it\u2019s been disruptive to us, but when we open venues like Bavette\u2019s which is the best Steak House in Las Vegas in now, we are seeing immediate customer demand. And as we\u2019ve discussed, as a destination Las Vegas has transformed itself literally into a sport\u2019s lover\u2019s town, and that obviously also drives more opportunities for the destination and for MGM. ","And if you add to that the fact that the Supreme Court will likely legalize sports betting this year, MGM is really poised to immediately take advantage of that opportunity. Sports as it relates to our performing events here and as it relates to our industry, we believe it is a significant avenue of growth for MGM Resorts in the further. ","So let\u2019s talk about 2018 for a moment and why we are optimistic. As we said before, first let\u2019s talk about the first quarter. It\u2019s a challenge because of the lapping of CON\/AGG and the fact that CES shifted a week. That said, if you look at CES it was another really successful show. In fact we reached at MGM Record Hotel Revenue days during that time. ","We also had good Super Bowl very strong and so far a really strong Chinese New Year and we remain very optimistic about the high end throughout the entire year. ","So despite the concerns about some of that calendar shift and some corrections more broadly, we feel good about the U.S. Economy and very positive about our forecasting ability for the balance of this year and certainly some of the benefits that accrue to a company like MGM, like the corporate tax cut change, that will also help not only MGM, but the customers that visit us. ","The fundamentals of our business are very sound. We continue to see very healthy levels of bookings. We\u2019ll get into that more specifically, but our corporate meetings and convention business is really terrific. The event calendar is outstanding for 2018 and we have some interesting ideas of how to continue to innovate our entertainment offerings, not only driving into \u201918 but into \u201919 and so I think that will bode well for the market place of which we are the greatest beneficiary. ","We also see good opportunities to grow the destination in Macau working with our fellow concessioners and the fact that MGM COTAI has much more to offer as it continues to add its new offerings. ","We remain committed to the investments that we talked about and being very disciplined in our use of capital and we are focused on the projects that we have in the pipeline that we\u2019ve ready outlined to you; obviously the transformation of Monte Carlo, the continued expansion of our brand here with the convention expansion at MGM Grand. The continued added addition to our portfolio with MGM Springfield opening up later this year and of course what we have going on in COTAI. And if you add to that what James Stewart and the team is doing over at MGM Growth Properties, which is certainly the premier triple net release three in the space, with a great cost to capital and quite a bit in their pipeline of which MGM is the largest economic beneficiary. ","We feel good about the prospects for the MGM Resort\u2019s shareholders and so what are we going to do with our future? Given our cash flow growth, and the fact that we are nearly completed with our development cycle, we intend to continue to execute on a very disciplined for pronged capital allocation strategy. First, we will continue to reinvest in our business where we know it makes sense to maximize performance and increase our competitive advantages, that\u2019s working very well here in Las Vegas. ","We will make sure that we maintain a very strong credit profile and an outstanding balance sheet. We will look for prudent growth opportunities where we believe MGM has a differentiating opportunity and where the returns can be outsized and we will continue to return capital to our shareholders. And on that note, since we started this journey we\u2019ve returned about $580 million to our shareholders and as I\u2019m sure you saw today, we also announced 9% increase in our quarterly dividend. ","I\u2019m proud of what we accompanied in 2017. I think that 2018 will be a great year for our company and with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Joe Greff ","Good morning, Jim. Good morning everybody. ","Jim Murren","Good morning, ","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Good morning Jim","Joe Greff ","Jim, your full year 2018 Las Vegas strip outlook suggest that the 2Q through 4Q will grow about 8% on average in terms of EBITDA. Can you just talk about how you see \u2013 obviously the 3Q has a very difficult comparison to what you delivered last year. But can you talk about maybe how backend loaded it is to the 4Q and just maybe you can give us some specificity on the group phase. You mentioned earlier that corporate meetings were terrific and then in that count you said that\u2019s steady. If you can give some specific data points behind that, that would be great and then I have a follow up?","Jim Murren","Sure Joe. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan and Corey. First on REVPAR, I think the guidance we gave is up 2% to 4%, and obviously with the hold that we have in the first quarter that would imply pretty decent REVPAR growth in the balance of the year which we expect.","Q2 and Q3 look about the same in terms of REVPAR up in the mid-single digits and we should be up double digit in REVPAR in the fourth quarter, to give you a sense of how that plays out. Obviously the fourth quarter against the unusual comparison a year ago, Q2 and Q3, you know really healthy REVPAR growth. ","We did have a couple of major fights in the third quarter that certainly drive lot of demand in the third quarter \u201917, that\u2019s going to be the challenge to do as well as that. On the other hand we have a couple of big fights ad a huge concert in the second quarter of this year, bracketed around I think an Investor Day Cathy\u2019s having to trying to entice investors to come on out because we have a big Canelo GGG fight right, happening in that quarter. We also have a U2 concert happening in that quarter and both of which bodes well. And there is another fight in the second quarter as well, so second quarter looks pretty strong from an event perspective. ","Third quarter we are still working on how to compete against great event calendar in the third quarter \u201917. But that\u2019s how the event shapes out. In terms of convention business, it looks strong all year. I\u2019ll talk to these guys to hit it, but we have seen good in the year for the year. Their pace is strong. Our convention mix looks like it will be about what it was last year. For this year really solid bookings and we get the benefit of REV\u2019s convention expansion, which is really unique and already well received. And so I think that looks pretty strong.","Dan, do you want to add anything to that or\u2026?","Dan D'Arrigo","What I would add Joe is obviously the hole in the first quarter by CON\/AGG, it was the biggest hall. There is some city wide shrinkage a little bit in the third quarter that we hope to get some corporate business, but other than that it looks pretty good on the convention side.","Joe Greff ","Great, excellent. Then Dan with sort of how you\u2019re thinking about the next few years in terms of domestic CapEx, you know we always kind of you know sort of penned you in the $500 million to $600 million range. I know in \u201918 it\u2019s a little bit north of that. How do you think about domestic CapEx beyond this year and kind of a steady run rate basis?","Dan D'Arrigo","Yeah, I think the $500 million to $600 million Joe is a good place holder as you look out multiple years. We are a little bit higher in \u201918. Part of that is timing and some of the bigger, chunkier kind of CapEx pieces that are come to the finish line in \u201918, so we are a little bit higher there in \u201918, but we\u2019re a little on the low end of the range in \u201917. ","So I think the $500 million to $600 million on a long terms basis is still the right level. \u201918 will just be a little bit higher due to some timing and some of the completion of as Jim mentioned, The Park, MGM, the Convention Center at MGM and so there is a few chunky things that just happen to fall into \u201918.","Joe Greff ","Thank you very much.","Jim Murren","Thanks Shaun.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Hey, good morning everybody. Just a quick follow-up on Joe\u2019s question. As far as the convention business in Vegas, Corey are you seeing much in the way of overflow into the lower priced shoulder months and I don\u2019t think I got a sense of what the general pricing is on the business that you\u2019ve got on the books. Is it up mid-single digit or a reasonable guestimate?","Corey Sanders","On the lower months, so this usually happens within the year or during the year and so we have some leads for that period right now that we are pretty optimistic about. On the pricing, we have on the books from a definite perspective. We are seeing low to mid single digit growth.","Harry Curtis","Got it. And then Jim you mentioned that Grant is on the phone. I wonder if he might give us some early impressions on traffic and volumes since the opening and maybe the reasonable question is how many cylinders do you think its operating on now versus what it can get to?","Jim Murren","Sure. I\u2019d like to know too Grant, so\u2026","Grant Bowie","Thank you. Harry, well the right thing about having a Chinese New Year is there\u2019s never a shortage of people. The great challenge of having at Chinese Yew Year, if you\u2019re not ready it could be quite scary and what I would say on both counts is we have really pushed the capacities to the property significantly over the last four or five days. So it came up well. Its sitting \u2013 and most importantly, the take up right has been very strong. Now we\u2019ve had traffic through here. Just some foot traffic exceeding Macau and as Jim said, the Macau numbers are very strong.","It is the ramp up period and we are working it through, but if there\u2019s one number that really sticks out to me is that from get-go we\u2019ve been able to get the mass win per unit per day on the gaming tables. Pretty close to the same numbers that we\u2019ve got in Macau and we wanted a market leader.","So the critical point is, I think I told you that we\u2019re positioned well to the market that we\u2019re targeting. So that mid-premium mass market. So I am very pleased with the feel and the pace and the rhythm that we\u2019re getting into the property. As you would expect, we had some challenges, but apart from that it\u2019s been touch wood, very smooth, and now we just need to dig in and really start executing on our other plan.","Sign-ups through our relationship program are running at about nine times the rights that we\u2019re getting in Macau and that is positive, extremely positive to us despite from what was heard throughout the market here and interestingly enough, even before we got going we already had built up nearly half a million participants in our vChat accounts. So we half a million people already following us before we even opened doors. ","So all in all I think it\u2019s very positive. Yes, it\u2019s a challenging time to make any judgments, but there\u2019s some really, really good first indicators and the appeal is amazing. The only challenge though I have is how do I monetize people taking photographs as Jim said. It is phenomenal and therefore we\u2019re going to get huge amounts of reach adding to the market, because all of those photos are going on social media. ","If there is anything specific Harry other than what I\u2019ve said, happy to try and fill in the gap.","Harry Curtis","I guess the one gap I\u2019d be interested in is your expected opening of The Mansion rooms and where does that position you versus some of the higher end offering in Macau?","Jim Murren","Well, The Mansion will be totally unique. I don\u2019t think that specific product actually exists yet. There is some beautiful other suites in other properties, but I think the whole private, personal night here of what The Mansion created in Las Vegas being injected into Macau, I think is extremely unique and that\u2019s all part of this dream and we\u2019ll bring that on later in the year. ","Critically for us first is we want to get moving on the junket, so they might come on a little earlier than the \u2013 and then once the junkets are in, then The Mansion will bring out the rest of the \u2013 will be the last piece of the puzzle for us to lock in. So I think its unique. I think it\u2019s an amazing environment and I think it just picks up from what\u2019s already been achieved and the market knows what to expect because there are so many customers out here who have various semantics of Vegas.","Harry Curtis","Grant, thank you. That does it for me.","Jim Murren","Thanks Harry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, good morning. Grant, maybe to stick with just kind of where on COTAI for a quick minute \u2013 could you just give us a little bit more if it\u2019s possible on sort of the specific timing? Do you think The Mansion rooms are opened by the end of the second quarter still or does that shift at all and when do you think you could have some of those junkets in the building up and running as well?","Grant Bowie","Well junkets, we\u2019re looking to try and get in sort of June, July and it looks like with The Mansion just getting all the details finished we\u2019ll be opened in September.","Shaun Kelley","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then maybe to switch back to Vegas, you guys gave very good color on the corporate convention side, but you know the Monte Carlo ramp is clearly having some impacts on both, kind of what you guys delivered in \u201917 and how \u201918 plays out too. Could you just give a little bit more color on sort of overall we netted out how do you think that you know the kind of Monte Carlo Park transition ends up impacting total dollars of EBITDA throughout \u201918 and then what kind of lift or IRR should we be trying to think about for that investment as we blend into \u201919 and \u201920?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Shaun, this is Dan. On the IRR front we are looking at the investment, it\u2019s just a little bit over $500 million for the conversion and transformation to Park MGM and NoMad on the capital side. It\u2019s about $525 million in total. The return on that we expect to be mid-teens, cash-on-cash return as we ramp that property up. It will be completed as we said in the release by the end of this year, so the last components come on in the fourth quarter, that being the NoMad and the completion by the end of the year. The front entry and the eatery and some more food and beverage entertainment product will be online by the end of the year. ","We would expect the brand campaign to be launched and running in the back half of this year, 2018 and so you know I almost look at this again to a new property opening, because the property will be so different and unique and a new brand will be cushioning that brand campaign throughout \u201918 and into \u201919 and I expect \u201919 to be a ramp up period with kind of \u201920 being achieving kind of that full kind of cash-on-cash return that we\u2019re looking for.","Jim Murren","Yeah, the other part of it, I think you\u2019re looking for what \u2013 how it hit us in the quarter and going forward on the EBITDA especially.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yeah, I think when you look at the quarter, fourth quarter in terms of its impact, about two-thirds of the decline was a result of the construction disruption. Obviously we\u2019ve been bringing things back online, but there is still a lot going on, a lot of disruption there. So that was about two-thirds in the fourth quarter. ","There is still going to be a level of disruption in Q1. We\u2019re estimating that to be about $9 million, $10 million in terms of the EBITDA impact from a construction stand point. So there is still again some disruption throughout \u201918 and there\u2019s a lot still going on, a lot coming online. We\u2019ll give you move color as we get through the year, but about $9 million, $10 million in the first quarter is related to that disruption.","Shaun Kelley","Just to be clear, on the mid teens type number when we get to stabilization, is that inclusive of or after getting back some of just the pure disruption that you lost in. So it will be that on top of whatever the run rate was before the project began directionally.","Jim Murren","That\u2019s correct. I think you know if you look at prior to kind of putting shovels on the ground and I think the property was doing, you know call it circuit kind of $70 million, $80 million of cash flow, so that\u2019s off of that pace. So your thinking about it correctly Shaun.","Shaun Kelley","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, good morning, thank you. So Jim in your prepared comments, when you were making comments to that, the use of capital, it seemed to me that maybe you were asking us to read between the lines regarding what is the uses of capital, which would be M&A. So just wondering, are you actively looking for opportunities and if something would come up on the strip, would you be interested in that?","Jim Murren","I\u2019m looking at \u2013 first off, I don\u2019t prepare anything, so these are unprepared remarks.","Felicia Hendrix","In you\u2019re off the cuff remarks?","Jim Murren","I am looking at my off-the-cuff remarks and I don\u2019t see anything between those lines about M&A. But no, honestly we are not focused on M&A at MGM Resorts. We\u2019re focused on M&A at MGM Growth Properties and James will speak to that on his call, but I think that what I would say about the strategy, we like where we are. We see rapidly growing free cash generation in this company over the next several years. We have articulated what we want to do with that cash to our board and to our investment community and we\u2019re going to stay the course.","Clearly we\u2019re part of a dynamic industry and so we will always keep our feelers out there and figure out what\u2019s going on in our industry, but we certainly like our positioning as a market leader in every market that we operate with exception to Macau and now that we have COTAI, we\u2019re going to pick up a bunch of share there we believe and I wouldn\u2019t read anything into a deviation of our articulated strategy.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, thank you for that. And then just switching gears, can we just talk about the environment on the south end of the strip. Can you talk about their promotional environment there and have you \u2013 how has it been changing, maybe kind of daily or weekly and I am trying to get to that, but also just understand its demand for Mandalay Bay. You know where is that? What are you doing to drive traffic? You know how long can it take to improve, you know that sort of thing?","Jim Murren","Yeah, there is no doubt we were more promotional in the fourth quarter than we would have been otherwise and we were more promotional in the fourth quarter than we are right now. We\u2019ve already started releasing quite a bit of that pressure, but do you want to speak to that?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yeah, I think when you look at it obviously, given the incident of October 1, we really had to kind of go off script of what we were doing throughout the first nine months of the year. The team did as Jim mentioned earlier, a great job in executing and I would say there is a huge amount of recovery already within Mandalay that has taken place. ","But there is still some residual impact at Mandalay as you recall roughly about 80% of the cancelation volume that we saw in the fourth quarter was directly impacting the fourth quarter, but there was some impacting the early part of this year. So I think as time continues to progress here, that Mandalay continues to recovery and continue to get back to its normal self. But there is still a little bit of an impact in the early part of this year. ","Jim Murren","Yeah, and I would just say that the promotional activity as now here we are in February is same towards last year. ","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yeah, I think it\u2019s pretty similar Felicia. The only hole you have is the CONEXPO hole that companies are probably maybe trying to fill, but the way we are yielding variances back to where we were before. Mandalay Bay\u2019s impacted us a little bit more, because we also were a little slower on turning back the marketing on that property for a few more weeks. So it will have some impact in the first quarter, minor in the rest of the quarters, but everything else feels like it\u2019s pretty much back to normal. ","Felicia Hendrix ","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Stephen Grambling","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. You know maybe looking longer term, I think at the 2016 Analyst Day you had consolidated adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow projections through 2019. Can you just talk to the biggest puts and takes versus that range and then I guess on a related note, I know you have a goal of hitting prior peak margins on the Strip. Maybe u could remind us where that peak and what might be different or similar about the operations now versus that can make that target either achievable or not? Thanks.","Dan D'Arrigo","Sure Steve, this is Dan. So at it relates to kind of prior peak levels in terms of our Strip EBITDA margin, they were roughly around 33% here in Las Vegas. So I think when you kind of look at the trajectory, we\u2019ve been on the guidance we\u2019ve been given, we continue to kind of be on that path to achieve those levels over the next year or so and get back there. ","I think the, if there is upside to that, it\u2019s going to come really from out stretched kind of top line growth. We still think there is good side upside to the economy, we are still growing but that\u2019s really been kind of low single digit growth. I that turns out the upside and out phases our expectation them you know there could be some upside to that margin. But based on what we are seeing right now, what we are doing in terms of cost containment and the programs that continue today from PGP, etcetera, we think 50 to a 100 basis points year kind of guidance puts is on the trajectory to be back at those peak levels within the next 24 months. ","So we finished up around just north of 31% last year. It\u2019s probably a little bit higher than we expected. So we feel like we are a little ahead of the plan thus far, but continue to be on that pace. ","As far as the puts and takes on Analyst Day, that\u2019s gone back almost kind of two years now. The biggest one is probably in just the timing around COTAI. I think that model if I remember correctly had kind of COTAI opening in kind of March, April of 2017. So that\u2019s probably the biggest in terms of the change that model would be the timing around COTAI and obviously now the growth of that market that was not kind of laid out in that model when we put it together back in \u201916. ","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","And I\u2019d add a couple of things to it Dan. One on the puts and takes on the model. We underestimated the impact of Monte Carlo. So certainly, that we are below where we through we would be in terms of cash flow there. But every other Strip property is at or above what we are looking for. ","With Bellagio hitting an all time record as an example, our regional properties are sport on, in terms of what we had projects and so I think the put and take is the opening of COTAI, that was the big difference. ","Dan D'Arrigo","And probably, now that we know the tax reform is obviously another one that will positively impact our free cash show in \u201918 and \u201919 and beyond from that standpoint as well. ","Jim Murren","And in terms of margins, the one point I\u2019d make out \u2013 I\u2019d bring up right now is, depending on your raise on inflation, inflation has obviously impacts to the industry both negatively in terms of labor, but also positively and in terms of pricing power. So to extent that we can improve our revenues through pricing power in a slightly inflationary environment versus our expenses, we should input to see margin improvement that we did not see prior to 2007. ","So I would \u2013 since the dawn of time, which I define as 1984 when I joint Wall Street, you know hotel companies and casino hotel companies typically do well from a margin perspective in inflationary environments because the ability to change prices instantly against the backdrop of expenses is a favorable dynamics for companies like ours. ","It certainly, we see as the case here as we continue to increase pricing in a verity of channels, whether it be in room rates or fees. Our restaurant prices we believe that we have some room lent to grow in all those and that should more than offset the inflationary impact of labor and other expenses. ","Stephen Grambling","It\u2019s all very helpful and maybe if I could sneak one follow up in since you brought up the benefits of tax reform. I guess how is tax reform and the incremental cash flow thought about differently in the sense of capital allocation. I know you previously said 3.5 times I think where your target leverage ratio is. Does that change with tax reform?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","No. We do this as a windfall unexpected pickup for the company, but our leverage targets remain the same and so the ability to have additional cash available will be allocated to the areas that I talked about in terms of return on capital to shareholders and if we find good ROI growth opportunities, but we view that as part of the overall fee cash flow story. ","Stephen Grambling","Fair enough, thanks. Best of luck this year. ","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Thanks Steve.","Jim Murren","Thanks Steve. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Carlo Santarelli ","Hey everyone, good morning. Guys if you could just as you talk about 2018 and obviously you guys provided a lot of color on the top line. When you think about the 50 to 100 basis points margins and obviously you spoke to some of the challenges putting you closer to the lower end this year. Just in terms of cost pressure as it pertains to the strip this year. Is there anything outside of the one timers and some of the old headwinds from last year that you guys would point out. ","Jim Murren","Well, we have labor negotiations.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yep.","Jim Murren","That\u2019s always \u2013 you know that happens every fourth, five years, we can discuss that. So that\u2019s happening right now. We are having good dialog with the union as are the other companies on the Strip. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out, but that\u2019s certainly an impact as it relates to Las Vegas. Other labor issues, don\u2019t see, are FDs are in good shape. Other expenses no. as you know we were early on adopting an independent strategy on energy that has worked to our benefit and so I don\u2019t see any expense changes at all for this year. Do you guys?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","No.","Jim Murren","Outside of Las Vegas we also have discussions with the union that we are working with at National Harbor and so that\u2019s a discussion that\u2019s ongoing right now. We have the expenses that we are taking now as we are ramping up MGM Springfield, which is looking fantastic though, by the way and opening up soon, before September, before Labor Day and other than that I see nothing. Do you guys?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","No. ","Carlo Santarelli ","Great, thank you and then Dan, maybe this one is best for you. Just in terms of the cash taxes for \u201918 and \u201919, that\u2019s very simplistically you\u2019re looking for something like 1% effective rate from the cash side. Is there anything in particular that could change that setup? I noticed that the language around that and the GAAP tax seem to be, that the GAAP tax piece is obviously a lot easier to forecast. ","Dan D'Arrigo","No, we are not anticipating any material or significant changes from that level. I think when you look at 2017, I think in total we had, about $180 million of cash taxes in total. We\u2019ll still have some state taxes in 2018 of roughly plus or minus call it around $20 million of State taxes in 2018 but pretty minimal in terms of federal taxes in \u201918. ","Carlo Santarelli "," Very helpful, thanks a bunch. ","Jim Murren","Thanks Carlo. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John DeCree of Union Gaming. Please go ahead. ","John DeCree","Good morning everyone, thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Borgata business in Las Vegas. I think in the slide deck you had mentioned a little bit about strength in the international business and I think a couple of years ago we saw Macau as kind of the leading indicator relative to Borgata performance in Las Vegas. So wanted to see if you can provide us a little bit more color as to what you guys are seeing in the business in Vegas and perhaps some antidotal comments here in town on Chinese New Year so far?","Jim Murren","Well, maybe I\u2019ll start that and anyone jump in. That was at the party that I was at Sunday night. The high end is very healthy right now and the Borgata business is very strong. We hosted our major event for the event for the Year of the Dog at ARIA on Sunday night. We had 2900 people in our ballroom and we had had over 900 people on our waiting list to be able to go that event. The tone of event, the tone of business in town is better than we\u2019ve seen in a number of years. And we are feeling very encouraged by the level of traffic that we are seeing in town at our properties and our competitors properties. ","We also had an extraordinary successful two day concert at MGM Grant. A performer that\u2019s knows around the world and sold out and highly recognizable to that customer. So the tone in the town I\u2019m sure is robust for everybody. It certainly has been for us here at MGM Resorts, at ARIA, Bellagio and MGM where we cater to that type of play and that\u2019s encouraging going into this year, particularly because we have some events slated for the year that draw high end customers and you know a big fight does that, a major concert does that and we have a couple of both. So I would say that is encouraging for us. ","Our market share in town is growing and I think that the fact that the COTAI is open is going to help that as well. We are getting incremental cost country play; people coming back and forth, sampling COTAI as Greg could speak to, they haven\u2019t been to the property in a while and they are coming here. So Corey, you want to add to that.","Corey Sanders","What I would add is, if you look at the Borgata play there is a huge correlation between what happens in Macau and what happens in Vegas and the fact that Macau\u2019s backup again I think you are seeing a lot of strength here also. ","Jim Murren","And I think the one point I\u2019d add to Corey is that what we are also seeing is more domestic players as a percentage of the Borgata mix than we ever had before which is encouraging both form the other standpoint of the mix of play and also the strength that we are seeing here domestically in our customer. So there is more domestic play as a percentage of the overall Borgata mix than we\u2019ve ever seen before.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yes, I would think that January, you know Chinese New Year surrounding the Super Bowl last year and into the end of January and beginning of February. The separation of the two events actually helped up and allowed us to fill our villas and mansions, both times with domestic customers for Super Bowl and the Asian customers for Chinese New Year. So that was also positive for us. ","John DeCree","That\u2019s helpful, I appreciate the color everyone. I wanted to as a follow up just kind of extend that question to the domestic gaming business in Las Vegas. We talked a little bit about inflationary pressures with tax reform and Jim I think your comments about raising prices. With the tax reform bill and the potential impact on the consumer, has the outlook for the domestic gaming business changed at all or are you still kind of thinking kind of a low single digit growth business on the kind of domestic casino floor. ","Jim Murren","I think it\u2019s early to tell. It\u2019s certainly a positive in terms of what we might see, its early to tell through, and where we would pick up business would not only be here, but I would think a property like Detroit, National Harbor, those will be properties that you know should see incremental benefit to this. So I think it\u2019s early but encouraging. ","John DeCree","Great. Thanks for the questions. ","Jim Murren","Thanks John. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Thomas Allen","Hey, good morning. When we think about your 2018 REVPAR guidance of 2% to 4%, can you just help us think about the relative performance by property or types of property? Thank you.","Jim Murren","Who wants to tackle that? ","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","You know, I mean I think the high end is going to do well, our luxury properties in general and if they do then that drives the core properties as well. But do you have any more specifically?","Yeah, I\u2019m just looking at numbers two and I mean Easter falls, a little bit of Easter noise here but...","Corey Sanders","I mean as Monte Carlo continues to kind of change obviously from you know a core classification that we\u2019ve historically had at that property. As that has been predominantly a drag in \u201917, that should become more a positive throughout \u201918 for us, so that would help the core propitiates from that perspective. ","Keep in mind in the first quarter the biggest impact of CON\/AGG, when you think about luxury versus core, it is more on the core side than the luxury, because they just don\u2019t have the ability to back to convention business and really are just rate takers during those big city wide events. So the properties that don\u2019t have a lot of convention space are the ones that will feel it during that week in March. So luxury still looks strong throughout the year based on convention. ","I\u2019d say as we kind of classify our core properties separately, they still have growth that are probably more affected by the first quarter and Monte Carlo will kind of help that group of properties throughout the year drive a better RevPAR story.","Jim Murren","And I would add a couple of things just to think about for this is, one is a big fight and a big consort in the second quarter that would benefit the properties around, where that\u2019s been held. It\u2019s been held in both cases at T-Mobile. We have the summer league coming in, obviously this would be the second year of really of MGM being the sponsor of the NBA Summer League, it would be bigger than ever. That\u2019s going to have a big impact on visitation at a time where we typically struggle, that\u2019s going to help. I think our team will be in the payoffs I think. ","Jim Murren","I was getting there.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","The Vegas Golden Knights. The impact, that\u2019s started the season at a 200:1 odds of getting into the Stanley Cup is now 9\/2, and a playoff series at T-Mobile would obviously have a big impact on New York, New York and Park MGM in the neighborhood. And then we get into the fourth quarter where we again are going to have some events. So I think it would be fairly broad based, but clearly where we have the most pricing power typically are in our luxury properties and Bellagio and ARIA, they set the tone and our properties are able to draft off of our luxury properties and I think that will help this year. ","Corey Sanders","Thomas, from a percentage increase the cores will also have the benefit of the resort fee increase this year which will help the percentage increase and core a little bit more. ","Jim Murren","Right, that\u2019s a good point Corey, I mean the some of the core properties are actually, we are lagging in the market to see whose portfolio had the higher resort fees, which is a great change since they started the resort fees not long ago, but welcome to the party. It certainly benefits looking at what our competitors are doing the market place and its helping overall pricing. ","Thomas Allen","Helpful, thank you and then can we just confirm what is the convention mix for 2017, was it 19.5% and then with its new commencing space, can that increase and will take that few years, or how should we think about?","Corey Sanders","So, it\u2019s right around 19% is where we finished up, which was where our target was for \u201917. \u201918 is shaping up to be very similar to that 19% as well. From a mix standpoint that does not include ARIA, so they are looking at a slight increase in their mix at ARIA for 2018 with their new convention space. The MGM Grand expansion comes on in early \u201919. So those start to see that benefit more in \u201919 than in \u201918. ","Thomas Allen","Helpful, thank you.","Jim Murren","Thanks Thomas. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead. ","Chad Beynon","Hi great, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to the 1Q guidance that issued with negative 250 basis points of margin declines. So if home loans are declining and the Monte Carlo impact is lower, is the 250 simply a product of Dan kind of what you just talked about with the tough comp form the core properties mainly in March and then also what looks like kind of a tough table hold. Just wanted a little bit more color on that guidance. Thank.","Dan D'Arrigo ","Chad, those are really the three drivers when you look at it. Obviously it\u2019s the comparison to CON\/AGG last year. It is the disruption at Monte Carlo and I think the whole of last year and the first quarter was north of 25%. So those are the three factors that are our guidance of that down 250 basis points year-over-year, so you are thinking about it correctly. ","Jim Murren","And probably a little bit of the impact of Monte Carlo. I mean\u2026 [Cross Talk]","Chad Beynon","Okay, thanks. And then can we get an update just on Japan that\u2019s been the news clipping a little bit more latterly. Just any milestones or any specific dates that we need look forward in 2018 from a catalyst perspective. Thank you.","A - Jim Murren","Well you know what you\u2019ve probably been reading is that the dial is moving forward and that there is discussion and debate around the gambling addiction counter measure bill I think it\u2019s what it called, which should the first issue that the diet would consider; that would to provide funding for and identification of problem gaming. ","And then the second measure would be the implementation act which probably what you have been reading about. And the current dialog there from what we see is still shooting for a mid-year discussion in the diet and hopefully a passage of that by say June or July. ","MGM has been very active there. We spent a lot of time both in local jurisdictions and in Tokyo and I think we are as well positioned as any company in the world as it relates to developing our reputation there, reaching out to potential consortium partners, talking time to understand the market, and we are very encouraged about that and it certainly \u2013 if the implementation passes, it will set off a highly competitive RP process and MGM is I think well positioned to positively participate in that.","Chad Beynon","Okay, thank you very much.","Jim Murren","And maybe last question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked already. Maybe just one with the \u2013 what your expectation or initial conversation has been around concession window [inaudible] maybe starting this year in advance of the 2020 expiration. Thanks.","Jim Murren","Well, thank you Robin. We had the honor or hosting the Chief Executive and most of the cabinet at our opening at MGM COTAI on the 13th and I could say that we\u2019re very proud of the event and I think that the feedback that we have consistently received from the government, leading up to the event has been very favorable in terms of what they think of the property and all the pre-tours and certainly that night. ","We have not had discussions about the concession renewal with the government. We have taken the view that if we continue to deliver on what we expect is the expectations of operators like ourselves, that we will be treated fairly and I was very confident of that. I think that sometime later this year or next year there will be a discussion around the concession renewal process or as the government says, the rebid of concession. But they have not reached out to us to discuss that and we have not reached out to them.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you.","A - Jim Murren","Okay. Well before we end, I\u2019d just like to first thank you all for joining us today and just reiterate a couple of points here. ","One is, I am incredibly proud of the people here at MGM, particularly after the events of 1 October. We quickly scaled our business, put our analytical and operational horsepower to work and made strong guidance about what we thought we would do in an uncertain time and we delivered on that guidance and delivered on the company for the employees and the people. That just shows how different a company that we are today than maybe five or ten years ago and really the strength of our business model.","We have strong tools to understand our business, both in terms of \u201918 and beyond. That\u2019s why you will sense more confidence from us in terms of our predictive abilities and we see a good year for this year on balance here in Las Vegas and in our regional properties and the outlook for Las Vegas, we didn\u2019t touch about it much in terms of new entrants coming into the market today, but we view positively in terms of driving investment in the town, creating jobs, construction and operating jobs that accrues to the benefit of the whole community. ","We loved the tax law change and the fact that people are pouring out of California to move to Nevada and that has an impact on housing and on incomes and on spend throughout the valley.","We are very excited about the expansion and renovation of the convention center and undoubtedly that will help the northern end of the Strip which has encouraged investments out there with the Fontainebleau Resorts World and the single greatest beneficiary as an incumbent to that is of course Circus Circus which enjoyed a tremendous year in \u201917. ","Though the out year we see that 13 moved all around Mandalay Bay for the Raiders Stadium, Bill Hornbuckle sits on that board. They are on track, they are spending money, they are working hard and that\u2019s certainly encouraging for us because we own that neighborhood and having the stadium there will have a big benefit to Mandalay, Luxor, Excalibur, etcetera. ","And so I feel like Las Vegas is well positioned and MGM is capitalizing on what we see happening in this market, and we\u2019re throwing off free cash and we expect that free cash to grow demonstrably and that provides us many opportunities to benefit our shareholders in terms of dividend growth, in terms of share repurchase, in terms of investing in our business to get outsized returns and yes, if a unique opportunity like Japan or anything else presents itself, we want to make sure we\u2019re able to capitalize on those in some cases one of a kind opportunities.","And with that, I will say thank you. Thank you for joining us and your support in MGM and as always, we\u2019re around to take any follow-up questions.","Operator","This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

After the company\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please note, this conference is being recorded.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Aaron Fischer. Please go ahead.","Aaron Fischer","Good afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com, and we\u2019ve also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today\u2019s press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.

You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation, which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jim Murren.","Jim Murren","Well, thank you, Aaron and good afternoon, everyone. Before we begin discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, I want to spend a moment talking about the announcement we made this afternoon. As you may have seen, I\u2019ve informed the board that I will step down from the company prior to the expiration of my contract. The board will promptly conduct a comprehensive search for the right leader who take MGM Resorts into the future. And I will do whatever I can to support the board during this time.","This was not a decision that I made lightly. However, I know the company is well positioned. Our balance sheet is strong. We have an efficient operating model and a powerful strategic plan. Our growth areas of sports betting, Japan and entertainment have never looked better. Our bench of management talent is deep.","The company is strong and growing. In my 22 years with MGM Resorts, I\u2019ve accomplished a lot and I\u2019m proud of the company it has become. Leading MGM Resorts as a CEO for the past 12 years has been the most rewarding and fulfilling experience in my professional career. And I want to thank our talented employees for all of their support and dedication.","Together, we transformed MGM Resorts into a global entertainment company with a worldwide footprint, while creating significant value for our shareholders. Looking ahead until a successor is named. I will continue to lead the company. As always, I will remain focused on executing our strategy and I\u2019m fully committed to supporting a seamless transition. I\u2019m confident that the board will find the right person who will continue to execute on our plan and drive value for MGM shareholders.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn our discussion over to our results. MGM has a lot to be excited about this past year. We began 2019 with two major plans. The first was to dedicate more focus on our asset-light strategy, which allows us to unlock the value of our real estate assets and recycle capital into higher growth, higher return opportunity. We\u2019ve made great progress as we monetized the underlying real estate of Bellagio and we\u2019ll soon monetize the real estate of MGM Grand Las Vegas at benchmark setting multiple.","We also sold Circus Circus Las Vegas, which was not core to our long-term strategy. We continue to work toward reducing our stake in MGP, which currently has a market value of around $7 billion. Our recently announced transactions as well as the anticipated cash redemption of $1.4 billion of our MGP operating partnership units are expected to yield $8.2 billion of net cash proceeds to MGM. These proceeds in conjunction with our free cash flow will allow us to achieve domestic net financial leverage excluding MGP of approximately one times by year-end, while still returning significant capital to shareholders.","As such, I\u2019m pleased to report that we paid down $3.1 billion of our debt in the fourth quarter. Further, as a testament to our continued confidence in our overall business and strategy as well as the value potential of MGM Resorts, we announced today a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend. We also announced the authorization of a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which we intend to put to use tomorrow with $1.25 billion modified Dutch auction tender. We believe that this is an opportune time to repurchase shares despite the volatility in some segments of our business.","While the coronavirus, which I will discuss shortly, will clearly have a near-term impact to MGM China, we remain confident that it will not have a long-term impact on our business. We\u2019re pleased with the outlook of our domestic businesses with strong underlying trends in Las Vegas, including continued growth in RevPAR, food and beverage and domestic gaming spend.","MGM has the benefit of having a good broad-based snapshot of our customer base here in Las Vegas. We have guests from all income groups coming from all over the world. And we were especially happy with the performance of our mid-market properties, which produced strong margin improvement. This to us speaks to the strong underpinnings of the Las Vegas market as well as the success of our MGM 2020 plan.","We are investing in Japan and in our online and sports betting business and while these businesses are contributing losses to our P&L today, we expect both to create meaningful value in the years to come. And we do not believe either these initiatives are reflected in our current stock price.","Secondly, we implemented our MGM 2020 plan, which a year later is successfully realizing material savings in labor, sourcing and revenue enhancement opportunity. We\u2019ve refined our operating model to create greater efficiencies and faster decision making throughout the organization.","We\u2019ve also completed implementing numerous labor and yielding initiatives, which will drive more upside this year. We\u2019re proud of the progress we made during 2019, as we look forward to steps to evolve our organization. We\u2019ve advanced our transition to a less asset intensive business model. We\u2019ve made meaningful strides to optimize our portfolio, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our free cash flow.","In 2019, we also returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Since the end of the year, we have continued to buyback shares and as of earlier this afternoon, we had only $4 million left remaining on our current $2 billion authorization.","As we look into calendar year 2020, we expect certain headwinds, which we believe are unpredictable within a reasonable range of accuracy. We\u2019re currently navigating an extremely fluid environment with the coronavirus, which we are taking very seriously. The safety of our employees and guests is our top priority. And we continue to work closely with the local authorities to ensure that we\u2019re doing what\u2019s right for the wellbeing of everyone there.","As such, our Macau casinos and gaming areas are currently closed. So we are maintaining some non-gaming facilities to support our hotel guests. During this time with our casinos closed, we are actively managing our costs and are incurring approximately $1.5 million of operating expenses per day across both properties. The majority of which is payroll.","While the current situation creates volatility in our business near-term, we are confident that does not reflect the medium to long-term earnings potential of these assets or the marketplace. In fact, while short-lived, we have been seeing signs of an improving marketplace during the first couple of weeks in January with our businesses averaging just under $2.5 million of property EBITDAR a day.","In addition, the Far East baccarat market here in Las Vegas had a difficult year in 2019. And as such, we are cautiously not expecting a material recovery in the near-term. And so given the current environment, we have decided to remove our 2020 financial target. But with that being said, organic growth in our U.S. business, excluding Far East baccarat has been tracking in line with our expectations. And we see the strength in our underlying domestic business continuing from the fourth quarter into this year.","We also remain deeply committed to substantial growth of free cash flow per share this year, driven by healthy EBITDAR growth, moderating CapEx is our properties are an excellent shape and a reduction in our share count.","So moving onto our results. Our full year 2019 consolidated net revenues increased 10% and consolidated adjusted EBITDAR was up 6%. Our fourth quarter consolidated net revenues grew 4% and we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDAR of $682 million. Our fourth quarter results were solid, but below our expectations.","Mostly due to the persistent weakness in Far East baccarat volumes and hold in Las Vegas, as well as couple other one-time item. We\u2019ve also accelerated our investments in sports and in Japan. Our Las Vegas Strip hold adjusted property EBITDAR for the year was $1.67 billion and $392 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding Circus Circus and the $24 million insurance proceeds we received the prior year quarter, our hold adjusted Strip EBITDAR increased 4% year-over-year.","Our fourth quarter results continued to be driven by strong demand across all of our segments with Far East baccarat being the only key offset. Our Strip net revenues were up 4% in the quarter. Non-gaming revenues and REVPAR both up a robust 6%. Our convention business was exceptionally strong. And we finished 2019 with an all time record convention mix for the fourth quarter and the year at over 21%.","Our casino revenues decreased 4% with table games win down 18% driven by that Far East baccarat. Our non-baccarat table game and slot win were actually up in the quarter. Our first and fourth quarters have historically trended higher in Far East play. And as we mentioned on our last call, we knew we were up against a tough comparison quarter as the prior year\u2019s quarters casino volumes were very strong. And while our Far East business in the fourth quarter was roughly in line with the second and third quarters, it was still lower than we had expected, driven by handful of premium high end customer.","To provide some context, Far East baccarat has historically contributed anywhere from 5% to 7% of our Strip EBITDAR and now it\u2019s down to 2%, which creates a low base for 2020. In other words, Far East baccarat contributed a little over $35 million to our 2019 adjusted EBITDAR and that was down over $100 million year-over-year.","Our fourth quarter Strip EBITDA margins would have been up about 1.5 points year-over-year, if you were to adjust for Circus Circus and the insurance proceeds received in the prior year as well as the baccarat impact.","Regionally, we operate some of the premier assets across the United States, with leading positions in most of our markets. Regional operations fourth quarter net revenues and adjusted EBITDAR grew 15% and 14% respectively, due to the inclusion of Northfield Park and Empire City.","In 2019, MGM National Harbor and Borgata each generated over $200 million in 2019 adjusted property EBITDAR. And our Mississippi operations grew EBITDAR by 13%. MGM Springfield has admittedly performed below our expectations and we\u2019ve recently made some changes there to better position in the property.","MGM China\u2019s net revenues grew 6% in the quarter, despite the 8% market-wide GGR decline. Adjusted property EBITDAR was up 10% to $185 million, driven by MGM Cotai, which grew EBITDAR by almost 40% year-over-year to $75 million. VIP hold normalized EBITDAR was up 11% to $177 million, despite the short-term uncertainty in the marketplace, we remain well positioned there. As MGM China strong liquidity position and strong balance sheet bodes as well. And of course, Grant will be on the line to answer your questions during the Q&A.","Moving on to MGM 2020, I\u2019m proud to say we continue to make excellent progress on the plan, achieving all of our targeted savings and revenue enhancements, some of which continue to be on an accelerated basis. As of year end 2019, many of our initially identified labor and sourcing initiatives have been implemented and we will continue to drive further upside this year.","In the fourth quarter, we achieved approximately $55 million in incremental EBITDAR, bringing our total to north of $130 million for the year end 2019, clearly, we\u2019re ahead of plan. We did experienced like delays in the fourth quarter and rolling out certain technology related initiatives, which is now occurred by the end of the year. And we remain confident that we will beat our $200 million adjusted EBITDAR uplift goal by year end. And Corey, of course, is here to provide more detail on that during Q&A.","Looking out further, we expect the healthy trends in Las Vegas outside of Far East baccarat to continue into 2020. We expect strength in the first quarter driven by our convention and entertainment calendar. Last year, visitation grew 1% to near historic high levels. In McCarran\u2019s passenger counts reached an all time record of 51.5 million.","Consumer confidence remains high. And while leisure booking windows are naturally short, we continue to see strength in that segment, especially, bolstering our legacy properties. And we have a lot to look forward to. The city is continuing its evolution as a sports town with the NFL Draft in the second quarter.","We have pleased to be hosting the NFL Red Carpet event on the Bellagio fountain. Las Vegas will also debut the Raiders at the 65,000 seat Allegiant stadium, which is in Mandalay Bay\u2019s backyard and will serve as a positive catalyst for our south Strip property. In boxing, we also have the heavyweight fight Fury versus Wilder rematch just next weekend. Our convention business is shaping up well, especially with the return of ConAg in the first quarter.","Park MGM is also hitting its stride, with all of its elements up and running anchored by the wonderful unique food and beverage offerings and a strong entertainment roster at Park Theater. As I mentioned earlier, Far East baccarat remained soft market wide and we\u2019re not assuming a material recovery in the near-term at our luxury properties in that segment, namely at Bellagio, MGM Grand, and Aria.","And while the headwinds in 2019 set a very low base for 2Q and beyond, the first quarter remains a challenge in that Far East baccarat business. And finally, while we are currently closed in Macau, we continue to believe in the long-term success of MGM China.","Before I turn it over to Q&A, I think it\u2019s important to quickly reiterate our strategic goals for MGM Resorts. MGM Resorts is advancing its strategy of becoming an asset light operator of market leading properties across the United States. As a result, we will be better positioned to recycle capital from the more mature markets to high growth, high returning opportunities, such as sports in Japan.","By executing our strategy, we will: continue to leverage our brand and operating expertise as well as our investment in technology to enhance the guest experience; remain diligent about maintaining efficiencies in a streamline business with reignited focus and discipline on costs; continue to grow MGM China\u2019s market share in Macau, as we remain confident in our long-term prospects there; continue to reduce our ownership stake in MGP in the most efficient manner and ultimately deconsolidate.","We will remain committed in our free cash flow per share growth and very deliberate and thoughtful in our approach to capital allocation to, maintain a fortified balance sheet with our targeted domestic net financial leverage, excluding MGP of approximately one times by year end 2020, return capital to shareholders, especially as we continue to evaluate paths to maximize the value of our 50% stake in CityCenter, the real estate of MGM Springfield and our ownership stake in MGP.","Finally, we are in the prime position to capitalize on our two key long-term growth opportunities, Japan and sports, which we believe will create meaningful long-term value for MGM Resorts. We\u2019ve made a substantial investment and time and effort in Japan. And we believe the MGM and ORIX led consortium remains the front runner to win the license in Osaka this summer. We\u2019ve made significant progress with our sports betting business, which will support long-term growth for our online and bricks and mortar business.","Looking ahead, our path is clear and we remain focused on monetizing our remaining owned real estate assets, executing on our MGM 2020 plan and transforming the way we operate to position MGM Resorts for future growth and long-term value creation.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Greff","Hello, everybody.","Jim Murren","Hi, Joe.","Joe Greff","I have two buckets of questions. One, relates to your news, Jim. And then the second question relates to your comment on Las Vegas. On the first bucket of related question on you Jim, will you be staying on the board of MGM or MGP after a successor is anointed. My second question related to that is, do my perception of you is that you\u2019re sort of the point person or the face person for MGM in Japan. I guess, who is carrying the torch in addition to you in Japan for Osaka. And then my third related question is, do you anticipate any or should we anticipate any other executive or property personnel changes either now or in the medium-term as a result of today\u2019s news?","Jim Murren","Sure, Joe. I\u2019ll take those three. First, I think it\u2019s important to kind of reset why I\u2019m doing this and why I\u2019m doing it now. I really feel after 12 years, especially, after the last couple of years, we\u2019ve really changed the dynamic of this company. We\u2019ve created an incredible team of leaders, portfolio property president, property president, heads of centers of excellence. And I think company\u2019s honestly never been in the better position than it is right now.","And when I thought through, how I could best serve MGM going forward. I thought it was pretty clear that a leader should help lead a company into the next decade or two. And so I wanted to make sure the board had the time, which will use promptly to do a robust search and find my successor. And I\u2019ll help in anyway I can in that regard. I do that with the confidence that we have such a great team in place to my left, I look at Bill Hornbuckle and to my right Corey Sanders, Atif is on a plane flying back here, we have such great talent that I depend upon and trust to continue to run this company going forward.","And I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the board\u2019s process, they\u2019ve developed a committee. They\u2019ll hire a search firm and they\u2019re going to go out and find the best possible candidate internally, externally or otherwise. And until that time, I will remain in all my posts, Chairman of MGM Resorts, MGP, MGM China, but that\u2019s my immediate focus at this point in time.","As it relates to Japan, very likely in May, I will be leading a group of people, including Bill Hornbuckle to my left to speak to the people of Osaka as the Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts about why MGM and ORIX is the preferred partner. Why MGM and ORIX would be the operator that would put Osaka in safe hand. Why MGM Resorts and ORIX are the most responsible, most compliant, most dynamic company. And I\u2019m absolutely sure, I\u2019m going to be involved in the Japan project. In fact, I\u2019ll probably be even more involved in the Japan project as time goes by.","And as it relates to the team here, we have a seasoned, respected team that I intend to work with. I know the company values and will continue to be here as we seamlessly transitioned the company into this next generation. So I hope I answered all three of those.","Joe Greff","That was great. Thank you. And then switching over to just performance in Las Vegas, looking back at the 4Q, obviously, Bellagio, Grand and Mandalay Bay, those are the ones I guess, in that order, with Far East baccarat exposure. Was there anything else that those three properties are at the higher price point segment that\u2019s causing their performance to be market lead different than everything else on the Las Vegas portfolio. Is there anything related to MGM 2020 transition or distraction that could have an impact on operating expenses that perhaps we didn\u2019t anticipate.","Corey Sanders","No. Joe, this is Corey. To the contrary, they had a really good strong fourth quarter last year from that Far East segment in all of the EBITDA shortfalls from those properties are mainly from Far East. In particular, MGM actually had a record fourth quarter ADR number. So we\u2019re tracking the 2020 results at all properties. Those properties are probably getting a little bit more benefit. The shortfall from that party\u2019s business was the main factor.","Joe Greff","Great. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you, guys.","Jim Murren","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks. Two quick follow-ups. I just want to make sure I heard correctly to the last set of questions on your decision, Jim. I guess, first just to confirm, so you\u2019ll \u2013 are you going to be staying on the board of MGP. And then secondarily, you mentioned finding the right successor or the best successor. And clearly, the business has changed significantly over the past two years and really over the past 10 years. So how does that inform how the board thinks about the right background of a successor versus maybe 10 years ago? Thanks.","Jim Murren","Sure. Bill and I joined the same month, I think, Bill in 1998. Corey was already here. We had whopping one and a half properties. We had the MGM Grand and half in New York. New York, I think we had about 4,000, 5,000 employees in total and obviously, a gaming centric organization. And we have through the collective energy of so many men and women that have been here or still here created this global entertainment company that is far more diverse than ever before.","I think that an answer to the first question, I cannot get ahead or will not get ahead of the board search committee and process. I serve at the pleasure of the board. I\u2019ve said that I will stay on in whatever capacity. I\u2019m the Chairman of all those companies you mentioned as I\u2019m the CEO, but it\u2019s hard to say what will happen after that. But I do know is that the companies are better positioned now than they have ever been before, not only MGM Resorts, but MGP.","In terms of the characteristics of a new CEO, again, that will be a process that the board and the search committee, a lot of management here will have some involvement in. But I think you\u2019re on the right track in the sense that we are very diversified global entertainment company that expects to be able to evolve into a global experience, digital entertainment, sports company and be able to leverage what we\u2019ve learned about running these large resorts and what we\u2019re learning about the digital experience, which we believe is vastly under, if not at all, valued in the current securities of MGM.","And so we\u2019re devoting a tremendous amount of effort and time to our sports and entertainment initiatives. It\u2019s certainly dragging down our P&L right now, but we are planting seeds, which we believe will yield tremendous growth in the future. And I\u2019m sure, the board and the board members and the search committee will be looking at what MGM is going to look like five years from now, when they\u2019re evaluating the kind of leader that MGM Resorts should have.","And that really is why this is so rewarding a time for me that we\u2019ve taken the company to where we are today. Our strategic plan as well known to us internally, we have the right men and women in place. Our real estate strategy is well defined and obviously has been more successful than anyone imagined. We\u2019ve set the blueprint on how to continue to go down that path. And now it\u2019s time for the board to work with board members, a search committee and stakeholders to find the right person that will take the company to ever greater height than even we are today.","Stephen Grambling","So that\u2019s a good segue to a follow-up question just on sports betting. And as we look at the initial results of not only sports betting but iGaming gaming in New Jersey. Can you talk about your initial learnings in terms of the JV? How it frames the expectations for that longer term. And you mentioned some investments or spending ahead of growth. Now, are you at a point where that should start to moderate? Are you still in investment mode? Thanks.","Bill Hornbuckle","Stephen, hi, this is Bill Hornbuckle. Let me grab that one. Obviously, you can tell we\u2019re still very bullish. We feel a little underappreciated given what\u2019s happened in the marketplace. And some of the statistics are compelling and growing. We did over a $100 million last year in net gaming revenue. Our active player growth is up over 126% since June. Interestingly, we\u2019ve taken a unique position because of our asset based here in Las Vegas and the experience we can offer.","During Super Bowl by way of example, 8 of the top 10 bets in America are with Roar or MGM Resorts. We\u2019re in four States, quickly to be an eight by year end. We have access into 16 and we have a view on six more that we hope to government affairs to open up led by Massachusetts. Candidly, our GBC Ventures with Roar went off to a slow start in New Jersey, a two mega companies trying to put themselves together. We\u2019ve effectively done that. We now have 150 men and women working in New Jersey every day to push this forward. And I think we\u2019re in a much better place than we were a year ago.","I think, this Michigan is just passed. We hope to dominate and frankly, we should there. We\u2019ve got a huge retail presence. It accepts online gaming and casino as well, which we think would be a unique opportunity. We have done and executed a deal with Buffalo Wild Wings and I think about Michigan alone of the 1,685 stores, they have 27 of them are in Michigan. We\u2019ve got Yahoo Sports behind us, it\u2019s now just unwinding and launching, they got 60 million sports viewers and 7 million of our in fantasy alone.","And then in Las Vegas, literally next week, we launched BetMGM. We haven\u2019t even launched a platform here yet. And so kiosks, a presence and an overview around BetMGM and both on an app and as well as a branding exercise throughout all of our sports books takes play over the next three months. And so we\u2019re extremely aggressive.","Look, order of magnitude, while it\u2019s heavy \u2013 it\u2019s not heavy capital. If this whole thing cost both partners $100 million, it will be a lot, it\u2019s about $2 million state. If we invest over the next couple of years, $30 million each, that\u2019s probably realistic. But we had hope by 2023 pushing into 2025 to go into profit and you\u2019ve all looked at the analysts your own projections, if it\u2019s a $10 billion market, which is short in some people\u2019s examples and we own 15% of it, it\u2019s $1.5 billion, you can do the margins on that.","It\u2019s a real business and it\u2019s a real business before we take advantage of what brings us here in Las Vegas and what we\u2019ve seen in Mississippi and to some degree now with Borgata. So extremely bullish on the whole thing.","Stephen Grambling","Helpful. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.","Operator","The next question is from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi, thank you so much. I was wondering if we could just return to the comments, Jim, you had on the Strip EBITDA margin. You said it would have been up 1.5 percentage points year-over-year if it wasn\u2019t for Circus Circus, the baccarat situation and the insurance proceeds. But I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us understand how much baccarat affected the flow through on the margins in the quarter. Just the missed on the EBITDA margin side was considerable even hold adjusted. So I\u2019m trying to understand that better, especially, given the expectation for baccarat to stay weak. And along those lines, I was just wondering if there was anything you guys are doing on the cost side to mitigate the lower baccarat demand that you\u2019re expecting.","Jim Murren","I\u2019ll take part of it. Maybe all three of us have a different view. One good indicator is take a look at the mid market properties. And there you\u2019ll see, where the flow through works, margin improvement, couple of real strong quarters there. And the margins on Far East baccarat in general are so high that it has an outsized impact on margin. And that\u2019s what happened in the nutshell, at MGM, Aria and Bellagio, the underpinnings of those three properties outside of that segment, which is significant in the fourth quarter for them, were all very positive.","We typically do most of our business in that field in December, literally last couple of weeks in December. So we had projected \u2013 we knew we had a tough comp year-over-year, but we had a very poor December at those properties, which had the impact on the margin. And so, I mean, I think that\u2019s one answer to it. Corey, do you have any\u2026","Corey Sanders","Felicia, of that EBITDA miss, I would say, wholly owned $13 million of it was a hold adjusted. Aria also had a pretty big piece. The rest is volume. And we had a pretty strong quarter of the year before from a volume perspective as we identified last quarter. When you look at that business, as Jim has mentioned, it\u2019s really the premium Far East customer. The margins on that is pretty significant.","So now the base goes down to a pretty low base, as we mentioned earlier, about 2% of EBITDA. So we shouldn\u2019t have that headwind of trying to offset that $100 million of profit at a high fairly, let\u2019s say 60%, 65% margin. And so the comparison becomes much easier. On the cost side, Bill, do you want to cover things were doing there.","Bill Hornbuckle","Look, overall I think mostly through 2020, you\u2019ve all heard of the labor savings up over a $100 million, we remain there. The luxury properties have leaned into that heavily. We\u2019ve got several initiatives ongoing with purchasing and many of the suppliers that we\u2019ve secured. And so we are \u2013 all of that is clicking into play. It just got buried in this Far East story.","Corey Sanders","And we\u2019re looking at our international offices, our international staffing to make sure that matches the volumes.","Jim Murren","Yes, I guess the bottom line on that is we lost $100 million of profit last year. We only made $35 million. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going up against this year, $35 million of profit last year. And what we were trying to help you with is kind of you \u2013 if you\u2019re just getting back to your question, we\u2019re just out Circus Circus obviously. And that one time of the insurance proceeds we\u2019ve gotten a year ago and the baccarat impact, which is what Bill and Corey are talking about that hold and drop, our margins would have been up 150 basis points.","Corey Sanders","And the final thing I would add, on the non-gaming \u2013 we looked at our non-gaming margin improvement across all properties in Las Vegas, so we\u2019re up over 1.2%. So we\u2019re seeing the margin flow through in all the other areas. So that\u2019s what gives us some confidence.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And it sounds like you\u2019ve now like rebased so that top comps are kind of behind. And so when we think about our modeling going forward, we have that lower base.","Corey Sanders","Yes. There\u2019s going to be a little bit in the first quarter, right. We talked about that, but that\u2019s it. I mean, that\u2019s\u2026","Jim Murren","Not to the extent that we saw in the fourth quarter.","Corey Sanders","Yes. Not to the extent of fourth quarter but then that\u2019s \u2013 it is where it is now. It will come back. We\u2019ve been in this business a while but we\u2019re just not predicting any recovery in the Far East business this year. We just can\u2019t guess what that\u2019s going to be.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes, that\u2019s fair. And Grant \u2013 wake up, Grant, I have a question. So Grant, I know it was \u2013 Jim mentioned this a bit in his prepared remarks, but it was just kind of a quick sentence. Can you just talk to us a bit about what you were seeing pre-corona and I believe at the time, there\u2019s some market share gains and stuff like that. So can you just tell us, before everything kind of close down what you were seeing?","Grant Bowie","Sure. Thanks Felicia. And I was awake. Actually this is probably one of the most \u2013 greatest tragedy. We were seeing some really positive as Jim said, we\u2019re running at 2.5 for the period immediately into Chinese New Year. And with the Mansion online, we were way, way overbooked. We were actually not confirming any Mansion rooms because we just had a big list. So we were really in a very good place. All of the things we were looking at doing were really coming together.","But I guess that\u2019s what being in business is about. It\u2019s about how you handle the adversity and now we just reset ourselves and we just want to move forward. But by and large, everything was moving in the right direction. We were still tracking positively on guidance \u2013 share guidance, particularly in the premium end of the market.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Hello everyone. And first Jim, I\u2019d just have to say thank you for all of the service that you\u2019ve given to your company. And they\u2019ll still be there for all our questions, but it\u2019s been a great run. Thank you.","Jim Murren","Thank you, Harry.","Harry Curtis","Let\u2019s see. The first question I had is really related to the weaker Asia baccarat. I\u2019m just trying to understand, why it was such a surprise, was it due to competitive pressures. There were some thinking going into the end of the fourth quarter that Xi\u2019s visit might have pushed business to Las Vegas. What are your hosts telling you about the source of the volume weakness and did some of it come back in the early part of January?","Bill Hornbuckle","So, Harry, this is Bill. Let me take a first crack at that. Look as alluded to last year, we had an amazing event in the fourth quarter with Tiger Woods versus Mickelson that netted us substantive amount of EBITDA. So comparative, it was difficult, put that into the mix. The second thing is, as you know, all year, our ability to get liquidity in and out of Macau and China has been hampered. We continue to look at ways to do that righteously. We have been disproportionately hurt. I would suggest to you that our marketing environment as such, we relied heavily on junkets and large scale customers.","Our market share was well in the mid-40s for a considerable number of years based on we probably have more than $3 million customers and up in most. And I know we had more million dollars in customers and up in most. And those are the individuals most impacted by these \u2013 some of these liquidity issues. The interesting part of the year going into Chinese New Year, while it wasn\u2019t last year and clearly anything like 2018, we still had a reasonable show up. We had a great event. We had a decent concert at the weekend following with about 6,000 folks in it. And it wasn\u2019t a horrific event by any stretch given the circumstance and what had happened globally.","So we remain optimistic that if we can get through, obviously, and we will get through what\u2019s happening now in China and in Macau. And we \u2013 understand what can be accomplished with liquidity and getting those customers back to Las Vegas. The appetite\u2019s there, our desire to go after them and the network we\u2019ve created is there and will continue to succeed.","Harry Curtis","So as a follow-up, do you think that Beijing has put any roadblock in place that has impacted customer volumes?","Bill Hornbuckle","Well, I mean, as you know, in Macau, they\u2019ve become very stringent on utilizing the casinos and junket operatives for accessing liquidity in and out of this market or any other market. I don\u2019t want it, I won\u2019t predetermine where that directive came from or if it was their own directive, but that is fact. And so I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Harry Curtis","Okay. I just had one other quick one for Grant. You\u2019ve got a pretty good crystal ball, Grant. And just I wanted to see if you had an opinion on what do you think the markers will be that Beijing wants to see before they begin allowing customers back into Macau?","Grant Bowie","Harry, I think the critical point is it\u2019s going to be the spread of the infection, their sole and complete focus is about containing and eliminating this outbreak. And Macau government has taken very effective and decisive action. And indicators we\u2019re giving is that the single measure of whether the \u2013 when the \u2013 firstly, the casinos will be reopened and then hopefully the ability for IVS will be put on board, it\u2019s going to be about the containment of the virus. I think it\u2019s just simple as that.","Harry Curtis","So it\u2019s not a question of its just peaking. It needs to be eradicated.","Grant Bowie","Well, I\u2019m not a virologist, so I think it\u2019s just a question when the experts are comfortable that the cycle of the virus spread has been contained and they have it under control. It may also mean that the IVS program has not opened up as a single step, it may happen regionally. We\u2019re just sitting working with the government to make sure that we take care of ourselves and take care of everyone else and that we are ready. Macau was in a very fortuitous position because of that decisive action from the government. We\u2019ve had two infections, but we haven\u2019t had any since the action taken by the Chief Executive and that we\u2019re now up to eight to nearly 10 days without any further infection. So that\u2019s the critical point. We need to make sure that Macau is safe and then we obviously continue to work and support the initiatives in China to make sure we can contain this within China.","Harry Curtis","All right. Well, fingers crossed and thanks everyone.","Corey Sanders","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, great. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe just one big picture strategic one and then maybe a follow-up on the whole baccarat piece but on the strategic question, Jim, some of the prepared remarks, you did mention some of the future \u2013 as you laid out some of the strategy I think. You laid out some of the future roadmap here for the stake in MGP. Could you help us like, or maybe elaborate a little bit of that, I believe you talked about both kind of a potential further reduction in stake and then ultimately changes in governance or your consolidation there?","But could you give us a little bit more in either timing or the company\u2019s willingness to maybe change some of the \u2013 maybe unilaterally change either the dual-class stock or some of the mechanisms that could trigger a deconsolidation because we do get a lot of questions as we\u2019re sort of in process through all the big sort of asset-light movement here? And I think this would be helpful for investors.","Jim Murren","Sure. Well, first off, we are as the largest stakeholder of MGP its biggest supporters. And certainly the stock has done well since we developed the UPREIT a few years ago. Our economic ownership in MGP will be about 55% after the $1.4 billion OP unit redemption. And remember that\u2019s down from our original 73% stake. And we are absolutely committed to ultimately owning far less of MGP on a going forward basis.","And we are committed to deconsolidate MGP. We\u2019ve always said that MGP continues to have the right path forward with the right management team and it will acquire quality assets outside of MGM and it will access the capital markets to do so. And that is a path to further reduce our stake in MGP. The OP unit redemptions for cash provide another path for us to reduce our stake and we\u2019ll continue to look to monetize a portion of our equity stake as long as it is done in a manner that maximizes the benefits to both companies. Because I have to repeat, it\u2019s important to note that MGM is still an important stakeholder there.","You know that we have an agreement with MGP to redeem the $1.4 billion of cash at our election. When that\u2019s exercised in flow, it still leaves us with zone around $5 billion worth of unit. Those units have varying tax basis and \u2013 but a sizable subset of the remaining units have a higher basis and can be sold in taxable transactions with manageable tax leakage.","We\u2019re not going to get into the details of it specifically, but I can say with great certainty that it is our goal to continue to help MGP thrive, help it grow a diverse quality portfolio of assets, make sure it does so with a strong balance sheet. Help it find partners as it has recently had found with Blackstone that can show future growth opportunities for MGP and inject more capital into MGP and find a way forward that MGP very deliberately becomes that independent corporate govern number one type of company that MGM Resorts is.","We\u2019re proud of where we stand with ISS at MGM Resorts. We take corporate governance seriously, independence. We take our commitment to shareholders seriously. And we have nothing but the clear direction for MGP to do so in this deliberate fashion. And I think that, we\u2019ve proven that point of finding transactions that make sense for MGP, finding partners that could provide significant incremental value to MGP, making sure that MGP stakeholders, all of the stakeholders are treated fairly, ensuring that MGP has a strong balance sheet to provide a platform to grow in the future.","And it is our goal to make sure that MGP, the company that we believe to be the premium by far best-in-class triple net in its space, will continue to be able to thrive because it does have the best assets in that industry. And because it has the best tenants of any other triple nets, a tenant in MGM Resorts that is only getting stronger every single day from its own balance sheet perspective. And so I think history in this case is a really good guide to the future. And we\u2019ve made progress. We\u2019re a bit ahead of our plan, we\u2019re deliberate on this and we\u2019re going to continue to move forward so that MGP could continue to grow, grow independently and be the best possible triple net it could be.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you for that. And then maybe as the follow-up, we\u2019ve talked plenty about the baccarat business, but I think throughout some of the commentary, you guys also called out some specific investments in sports and entertainment but probably specifically on the sports side as some things are getting up and running. Could you perhaps either help us kind of call out or quantify either sort of what level of run rate were those numbers in the fourth quarter that we saw and probably much more importantly for folks, what kind of investment level are we looking at as we fast forward to kind of 2020 or maybe into 2021? And is that running through any of the divisional level P&L or is this all just stuff that we\u2019re either seeing in corporate or somehow kind of elsewhere in the P&L?","Corey Sanders","Yes, Shaun. It\u2019s Corey. It\u2019s probably in little bit north of $10 million for the quarter. Most of it\u2019s running through management and other, all of it\u2019s running through management and other. It would either be through the unconsolidated joint venture with Roar or investments we\u2019re making with regards to our sponsorships and team efforts there.","Shaun Kelley","Great. Corey, any thoughts on sort of next year budget of that kind of similar $10 million type number, is that a good quarterly run rate?","Corey Sanders","No, I think Bill gave a number on what we thought the investment \u2013 the additional investment would be in sports next year. And I think that\u2019s a good number.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Congrats Jim on what has a long and successful career at MGM and no, you\u2019re not going anywhere soon, but I just want to say thank you for your help over the years.","Jim Murren","Thank you. Thank you very much.","Thomas Allen","So look, there are a lot of moving parts in Vegas, so I just want to see if you could kind of level set expectations a little bit, at least for the first quarter given you do have some visibility into the first two months or the first month and a half of the quarter. So first quarter consensus for Vegas EBITDA is about $440 million, last year you did $400 million. Can you just kind of give us a sense of expectation?","Jim Murren","Well, I\u2019ll give you some macros around what we see, if that helps. And we\u2019ve been doing quite a bit of analysis on this. What we see first is strong population growth which is obviously significant for the local resorts out here, but also us. We see all-time highs in convention and meeting business. We see the prospect for strong McCarran business.","We see events this year, we did not have last year. If anyone saw Nashville last year, in terms of the NFL, imagine what Las Vegas can do, of course, CON\/AGG this quarter and The Raiders, everything leading up to The Raiders. Think about the Las Vegas Convention Center expansion. We\u2019re really excited about the Sphere. I can\u2019t wait to go to that. I think it\u2019s important to know that our slot win last year was actually up 4% for the year.","Our non-bac table games were actually flattish and we\u2019re going to have a lot more impact on 2020 in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. And so as that\u2019s ramping up, you should model in the fact that we\u2019re hitting our stride there. Conventions are important to the whole city. They\u2019re important to us. It\u2019ll be important to Mandalay Bay, which is returning back to its \u2013 really its full recovery.","It\u2019s kind of business as usual at Mandalay. We had very low attrition levels there in 2019, the lowest we\u2019ve had a few years. And that\u2019s starting to really build momentum. And there\u2019ll be a lot more groups in Las Vegas starting in the first quarter than we had last year, not just because of the citywide but with Wynn, and Caesars expanding their spaces. That\u2019s good news for the town. It\u2019s bringing more people to town. We\u2019re actually seeing some of that.","And finally that leisure demand that we talked about, I know those are short booking windows, but they are illustrative of real-time demand and they have been very positive and of course the entertainment calendars is terrific. So, we are getting into cash flow numbers and guidance and we\u2019ve talked why that we think this is a better approach toward communicating with investors.","We have a pretty \u2013 well, a very broad view of what\u2019s happening here in Las Vegas. And we like what we see in all of these metrics, save for that Far East baccarat business. But the domestic bac business, the domestic table business, slot business, the non-gaming business, combined with some real good trends in the rooms here in town, which of course creates nice flow through for everybody.","And we\u2019ll be amplified, at least for us this year because of really hitting our stride on our 2020 initiatives, which is ramping up fairly rapidly. Gives you a sense why we feel that there\u2019s a significant pace of cash flows here in the first quarter that are superior to what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Bill Hornbuckle","And Thomas, just looking at the first quarter, the other thing that I think we didn\u2019t cover Park is beginning to ramp and we liked the ramp that we\u2019re seeing there. So between Park, last year, we hardly had any 2020 benefit and then you take the RevPar benefit, we should expect to see from Q1 in a strong convention quarter. I think even though we will not be giving guidance, we feel pretty good about the first quarter.","Thomas Allen","I think its probably \u2013 you guys spent a long time trying to get people to shift that focus away from RevPar growth and you put up 6% RevPar growth this quarter and had really strong RevPar the past few quarters. I assume that should continue to be strong, that\u2019s not impacted by the Far East play and coronavirus isn\u2019t having an impact on kind of the core trend. Is that a fair comment? And just talk about the convention mix for 2022, it would be helpful. Thank you.","Jim Murren","Yes. I mean, we\u2019re going to stand by what we\u2019re talking about. We see these strong macro trends. It was a great RevPar quarter, there\u2019s no doubt about it. And I think what we\u2019ve laid out here is \u2013 gives you the setup for nice growth, but beyond that, we\u2019re not going to get too into it.","Bill Hornbuckle","Very minimal impact on corona.","Thomas Allen","Yes.","Catherine Park","We\u2019ll take the last question, please.","Operator","The next question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli","Hey guys and Jim, congratulations on your career. Just if I could when you guys look at the Las Vegas landscape today and think about the position that the company is in from a balance sheet perspective. Acknowledging that the buyback that you\u2019re doing in the near-term here as well as the incremental $1.75 billion that will remain outstanding. All coupled with kind of your one-times domestic, I believe that\u2019s an EBITDA number leverage correct after rent. How does M&A kind of play into that, given the fact that there could potentially be some assets on the strip that might fit nicely with the portfolio?","Jim Murren","Yes, we\u2019re really not focused on M&A. We like what we own. We approach our portfolio in a way that, particularly pruning it as we have over the last several years. We like these assets. I don\u2019t envision us being very focused on M&A going forward. I do believe that what we are looking at \u2013 where can we deploy capital in high ROI ways. We think that Japan, we think that\u2019s sports. If we can help motivate some change in Yonkers and provide more of a gaming experience there, that certainly was part of the strategic basis that we acquired that asset.","But that really is our focus right now is working toward reducing our asset, recycling that capital, getting that balance sheet absolutely \u2013 the best it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve been at the company right now and getting better. And getting ourselves so well positioned for whatever the world will bring in the future in recycling and returning that capital to the shareholders. 15% increase in the dividend today should send a message as well as the return on capital in the form of share repurchase.","And that really is our focus. Delivering on the strategic plan of 2020, making sure that this operating model, which is the young model. We have men and women that are only recently been putting these strong leadership positions, making sure that they have the ability to thrive, finishing the execution of this real estate strategy and really devoting. And I\u2019m going to spend awful lot of my time on sports and entertainment and on Japan, which I believe I could help the company best focus on those areas to create value for the future.","So with that, I want to thank everyone first for calling in and just highlight a couple of points before we end. We are focused on the impacts of the coronavirus. And I think Grant said it well, we\u2019re absolutely prioritizing the safety of our customers and our employees. But we feel that that situation will be managed and the company is well positioned given our diversification as a global company and our balance sheet strength. We\u2019ve made a lot of meaningful progress with our real estate transactions, resulting in the $8.2 billion of net cash proceeds. And we\u2019re using that dramatically reduce leverage to invest in places I just mentioned in Japan and in sports.","We\u2019re firmly on track to continue to announce additional real estate transactions this year. Our domestic business is very solid and we are very focused on these costs reductions, which we know will further support growth and EBITDAR and free cash flow per share.","I want to thank you all for your support. I want to make it very clear I\u2019m not leaving MGM anytime soon. And so I know for sure that I\u2019ll be on the next call with you and I look forward to talking with you all between now and then. And with that, have a very nice day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Please also note that today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Jamie, and good morning, and welcome to the MGM Resorts fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and we have furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","During the call, we'll also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance.

Finally note, this presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Jim Murren.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that we had a tremendous year in 2016. Our domestic resorts on a same-store basis grew its revenues and cash flows by 4% and 17% respectively, and that's the best performance since 2007. And with the addition of Borgata National Harbor our revenues and EBITDA increased 9% and 22% respectively. The CityCenter campus had a really tremendous year and Aria produced record EBITDA and EBITDA margins as well. Here at Bellagio, we had record revenues, RevPAR, EBITDA and margins, in other words the most profitable resort in Las Vegas in 2016.","The regional properties continued to lead their market, MGM Grand Detroit and Gold Strike had record cash flows for the year. And MGM China continued to outpace its fair market share in Macau, which is of course impressive given the significant capacity increase that has entered into that marketplace. I want to pause for a moment in looking at the \u2013 where our stock is and clear up a little bit of confusion, and also apologize for that. I think, we should have been more clear in our third quarter call.","We did discuss that the fourth quarter would be challenging as a result of the timing of the Jewish holidays. And between the holiday shift and the timing of a big group, literally one big group, the impact in the quarter, the fourth quarter was about $19 million, almost $20 million of EBITDA.","If you look at the second half of last year, because we obviously benefited from that in the third quarter, as a whole, we had a great second half. Cash flow was up 19% in the second half last year, RevPAR was up 6.8%, and our margins were up 320 basis points with a 29.3% margin.","And for the employees on the phone too, I'm sorry, for that confusion, we could have done a better job explaining that and also telling you what great job you have done. And on that great job, I want to talk about the profit growth plan. It was a great success last year. We closed the year 15% ahead of our original 2016 target.","We've now delivered over $340 million of incremental cash flow since we began the plan. We've improved our domestic same-store margins by 340 basis points year-over-year, and that is \u2013 means from just over 26% to 30% EBITDA margins in just one year. As of year-end, we implemented most of the ideas that were part of that original plan and we have \u2013 we're run rating now at our $400 million target.","We expect to actualize that target, $400 million, in incremental cash flow benefit in the first half of this year, which is also ahead of our original target of year-end 2017. And this is because we've transformed the culture at MGM Resorts and we've kick started this endeavor really ushering a new era here, new way of life on how we operate our business, which we believe lays the ground work for continuous improvement and continuous margin growth for the long-term, which is why the Board was confident yesterday to announce and declare our dividend.","We've come to that point that we've been hoping for, that we've been able to reduce our leverage dramatically, throw off free cash flow and it's time to return much of that free cash flow to our owners. The Board and the management team spent a lot of time on this, we've looked at our options in terms of returning capital to shareholders and received a lot of advice, some solicited and some unsolicited from our owners, bankers, et cetera. And after that deliberation, we decided that a quarterly dividend was the best path forward at this point. It shows our commitment to a balanced approach to allocate capital, grow our company long-term, and return value to the shareholders. And that is going to be the guiding principle for evermore.","Returning capital, disciplined investments, on the path to investment grade, and growing the company prudently and accretively. And I think it also underscores the Board's conviction that we're off to a good start in 2017 and we have very clear path for continued free cash flow acceleration in the years to come. On the fourth quarter, it must be noted that we had a very strong fourth quarter 2015 and we're able still to drive growth in net revenues, RevPAR and EBITDA. And as we did mention in the quarter, last year's call, we did have that tough comparison, as a result of the holiday shift. But even with the shift we're able to continue to drive off a strong convention base. And we actually had the second best fourth quarter convention mix in the company's history, only the year before was better. And we're able to replace some convention business by leveraging our database, which is significant and that increased our contribution from our casino and our leisure mix.","We did see higher spend across those segments, casino and leisure, and that offset this calendar shift that I was referring to, to some degree. For the year, we had a record convention mix at 19% and that's over the year before convention mix at 18.5%. That's gratifying. It's gratifying to show and to then celebrate the hard work of the yield management team, and the properties that achieved that 6% RevPAR growth that we had predicted at the beginning of last year, which of course is substantially above the national average for any other company in lodging or gaming.","And we're looking for strategies all the time that will benefit us even further in the years to come. Building up our brands, maintaining our vantages, not only here in our home market, but around the United States and we see that we can continue to move the needle here and elsewhere through our entertainment, our branding, our marketing, and our repositioning the properties, and a good example of that is moving Monte Carlo into Park MGM or the two major entertainment venues that we opened last year that we'll have the full benefit of in 2017.","It wasn't long ago with that, we were hoping for a new arena, we have it now, it's generating tremendous foot traffic and we're going to get the full on benefit of that in 2017 and beyond. It's really kind of remarkable to think of, when you think of our arenas last year, for example, the MGM Grand Garden Mandalay event center and T-Mobile, they all ranked within the top five arenas in the United States in their categories. T-Mobile itself pretty impressive, it's only been open for three quarters and it's already one of the top in the nation.","And of course adding to the entertainment on December 17, we added the 5,300 seat Park Theater and we've been selling out shows almost ever since with a variety of A-list entertainers, that is going to have a big impact on Monte Carlo in the neighborhood, as Monte Carlo becomes Park MGM and NoMad. On the East Coast, significant development and accomplishment, really a milestone for the company was to open MGM National Harbor on December 8, and that really has exceeded, I think, everyone including our own expectations in terms of the type of resort, the type of product and the immediate superiority of revenue and market share in that marketplace. We're averaging over 22,000 people a day visiting National Harbor. We've signed up over 150,000 new M life members in this short period of time and thousands \u2013 thousands new members every week. We're very happy about how the property is performing, and we're just literally turning on some of the marketing spigots as we've been working out the pre-opening and post-opening kinks to the property. And I think, it's safe to say that National Harbor is already outperforming. It's already growing the market and it is going to be what we all hope it would be in terms of one of the most profitable resorts in commercial gaming outside of Las Vegas. I am more confident than ever of that point.","We also, of course, had our first full quarter at Borgata, which is remarkable. It gained share in Atlantic City. It had a tremendous quarter. It produced record slot win and over $220 million of EBITDA for the year. It's off to a great start this year with \u2013 in its 14 years of operation, it had its best January slot win in its history, this last month.","We've also been working with the State in Atlantic City to be part of the solution to that city's recovery and as part of that solution, we have settled with the State and agreed to a property tax refund of the amount $72 million. We split that with Boyd. We think that's right. We agreed, Boyd and MGM, that this is the right statement to make for Atlantic City, it provides cash to the owners of both companies and it provides clarity and closure to a long outstanding item.","We think there are many other opportunities to grow Borgata into the future. We're literally not even yet launching M life into that property; that's happening in a couple months. And we've been plugging in many of our PGP initiatives there. Over in Macau, MGM China continues not only to maintain share, but to grow it, and we've seen great stability in our mass business and that's supported by the premium mass, and you can see that in the key performance measures like player counts and theo. And I can't say enough about Grant and his team, and how well they've outperformed that market and how strongly they've remained focused on maximizing margins and cash flows, and of course, Grant will be online to answer any of your questions.","Now on the development front there, we announced few weeks ago that we've pushed back the opening of MGM Cotai into the back half of this year. That is still an accurate and good statement. The reason why we did so, is we're working with our developer, our contractor, construction folks, and the government to get to very precise timeline, and our whole team is over with Grant in about a week-and-a-half at a Board meeting, we'll have a lot more to report once we get through all that.","But remember, we're dealing with the construction of a building that is extremely intricate, complex, beautiful, as you can see from the investor deck and very innovative. And we think it's going to be very additive to the market, and as we said earlier, we're not rushing the opening, we want to make sure that we make a very good impression when we do open, and it will be as I said in the second half, and we'll have more clarity soon.","Final couple thoughts before I turn it over to Q&A. One is obviously we had a big aggressive agenda last year. We set a lot of goals for ourselves, articulated them all to you in individual presentations during our Investor Day and otherwise at conferences and frankly we exceeded them all. We've highlighted the value of our real estate, presented another platform for growth, created MGP which has been clearly very successful, proved out the MGP story through the acquisition of Borgata, we're able to negotiate that transaction that made it accretive to both MGP and MGM. We opened really important enduring long-term assets like National Harbor and T-Mobile and Park Theater.","We created an organization internally here that lives far beyond the profit growth plan, there is now built in muscle memory on operational excellence that gives us confidence for continued margin and profit growth including in the current quarter and throughout this year and beyond. We talked about this a bit on the Investor Day and we've added to that ever since in terms of the intellectual capital that makes us the most efficient, most professionally run organization in our industry.","We have profoundly strengthened our balance sheet. I don't know how many ratings upgrades we've had in the last few years. And we do believe that we're on the cusp of becoming an investment grade company. We see it now, it's well within our reach. And we're throwing off free cash flow right now. Free cash flow to a level that we feel that we can reward our shareholders for their confidence in us, and that obviously speaks to the institution of the quarterly dividend, which we expect will grow over time.","Now, I'd like to thank the 77,000 men and women of MGM, because obviously we couldn't have done all of this without you. We're very optimistic about the future. Our book of business here in 2017 continues to look great. We expect to increase our convention business to new records this year, that's due not only to a dedicated focus of providing a really good experience for our convention guests, the value proposition that we and Las Vegas provides, and the best sales team in the business.","We had a good CES throng in town last month. We have CON\/AGG just around the corner next month in March. And as we said this morning, we believe, we'll be able to grow RevPAR by approximately 7% in the first quarter, hard to find a hotel company that comes remotely close to us.","And keep in mind that 7% forecast is on top of 8% growth we delivered in the first quarter last year. We're still confident that we'll be able to grow our RevPAR throughout the year and to prove out that point, we just booked a huge multi-year piece of business with Microsoft, which starts this year and that business is very new to us and most importantly it's new to Las Vegas, as we're able to pry a huge piece of business out of another destination. And we're continuing to find ways to drive more large groups to Las Vegas, both in terms of the association groups, individual major companies like Microsoft to the benefit of the destination and to MGM.","We believe, we'll continue to outperform the lodging market this year, expect our RevPAR growth to be up all year, probably around 4% or 5% which is like 2x or 3x the U.S. average. And we expect that \u2013 because of that, our margins will continue to grow, I think, they will grow in the current quarter and in 2017. The fundamentals right now are very solid going into this year. We have that convention base that I referred to, we have over 90% of the business already on the books and we're going to have a record year in 2017.","We will continue to and have managed our expenses and therefore we believe revenue per occupied room will increase throughout the year, which as I said earlier will lead to we believe higher margins and higher profitability and accelerating free cash flow to the benefit of all of our shareholders.","And with that, I think we're all set, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And we can turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Hi, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Jim, you touched on a bunch of things that obviously investors are focused and we are focused on today, including margin and flow through performance particularly on the Las Vegas strip, can you talk about, maybe it would be hopeful sort of maybe getting expectations in the right place at the present time. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the Las Vegas strip in terms of flow through in terms of margin improvement? And then maybe touching on the Las Vegas strip as well, can you talk about what you're anticipating, how much group will be up in 2017 versus 2016 in both volumes, room nights, as well as pricing?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I'll start and then maybe I'll turn it over to Corey or to Dan, Joe. Yes. We are \u2013 there's a lot of operating leverage in our business and it obviously benefited us in the first three quarters last year, particularly in the third quarter and it came back and hurt us in the fourth quarter. And that's what I was referring to, we just have to be more specific with our investment community on what the operating leverage is going both ways. Here, for example, in the first quarter, I mentioned, we had a good CES, and obviously, the city is going to benefit CON\/AGG in March. So the operating leverage swings back to our benefit.","If we're able to grow RevPAR this year let's say 4% or 5% that means we're able to grow on a hold adjusted basis, because we are a gaming company too. But hold adjusted basis, we're able to grow revenues in the low to mid-single digits that should be fair for us, to be able to say.","If that is the case, the flow through will be \u2013 will be meaningful, because our expenses are not going to grow to that level. And if we look at the base of where we're starting from for this year, our margin last year, EBITDA was what 30% Cathy, Cathy?","Cathy Santoro - MGM Resorts International","Yes.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","30%. We'd expect margin growth. I'm anticipating margin growth in 2017. Now, it's not likely going to be 300 basis points, 400 basis points growth like we had from 2015 to 2016, but it should be a nice improvement in margin consistent with, in fact, we're ahead of the plan that we laid out to investors during our Investor Day.","So flow through we believe is going to be achieved in the current quarter, on a same-store basis. And remember also we have other properties that will be \u2013 we'll have for the year. But I think, if your question is specific to the Las Vegas strip, where we did confuse people and fall short of a published consensus.","If we focus in on that, which I think, is really the crust of the uncertainty today, we expect our margins on Las Vegas strip to be up this year versus last, we expect RevPAR to be up, we expect flow through therefore to be up and we expect to be able to grow on a same-store basis here in our existing properties' profits in 2017. Is that right, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","That's correct.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just on the flow through, before the days of PGP we thought flow though would be 50% in that \u2013 off of that low to mid single-digit net revenue growth rate, assuming table hold is normalized. Is that the right way to think about it post-PGP or is it a little bit better than that old 50% metric that you guys talked about?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","John, for us the focus is on margins as Jim pointed out, is really to kind of zero-in on the overall margin, because the flow through depending on where that incremental dollar is coming from and what source, it is going to shift and really our goal here is to take this 30% margin and kind of drive it to the next level, which is 31% and hopefully over the next two years, we're in that 31% to 32% margin. So, really that's the focus that we continue to keep the management team focused on and driving a goal here as an organization.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. And I'm sorry if I'm kind of being dense or being obnoxious here, but if we assume low to mid single-digit net revenue growth on the strip, and you get to 31% margins this year that implies something like 50% flow through, is that a fair expectation to have?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","I think that's fair, Joe.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, it is.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","It's the way the math just works, right.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","So, to answer your question, Joe, yes. We're trying to get away, so you can see Dan talking about is trying to get away from flow through every quarter, but the math works that way exactly, yes.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then that my prior group convention question.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. Joe, on the convention side as Jim mentioned we're going to have a \u2013 we're expecting to have a record year again in 2017. We are to that point where we're maximizing that space pretty high right now. So we'll even \u2013 we'll be up 2017 to 2016 about 3%, but in general now it's more about the quality of what we're putting in the space and the total spend of that group including catering and banquet and less about how much are we ahead because we have such a solid base.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","And I think from a mix standpoint, Joe, it's probably similar to what you saw from 2015 to 2016 and we're moving that from 18.5% to kind of 19%, and the goal would be to get into that low to mid 19% of convention mix in 2017.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then my one final question. You referenced on July 26, the strong RevPAR growth of 11% in Q3 of last year. Obviously it's a difficult growth comparison when you put it in there to highlight that, how do you think about the cadence of RevPAR growth by quarter, at least directionally.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Chris Nordling, do you have it?","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think as you look at it, Joe, obviously we gave 7% RevPAR guidance for Q1 and as Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, we think for the full year it's in that 4% to 5% range for the full year. That obviously would imply roughly on average kind of call it 3% to 4% growth per quarter at least and that will depend on the tougher comps like you said in the third quarter, but it's the way the math will run kind of in that 3% to 4% range per quarter.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead with your question.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey, good morning. Just as a quick follow-up, not necessarily focusing on flow through, but because that could be defined differently. But in 2015 and 2016, you had wholly owned RevPAR, call it 6% to 6.5% in Las Vegas, and your actual change in EBITDA \u2013 the uplift in EBITDA was quite averaged 15%. And so, if you \u2013 if the RevPAR growth is closer or the revenue growth is closer to 3% to 4% in 2016 \u2013 in 2017, is it reasonable to think that your EBITDA growth could be in the neighborhood of, call it 6%, 7%?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Harry, this is Dan. That seems fair, overall, obviously the last \u2013 the back half of 2015 and all of 2016 benefited from PGP, which is an important factor in driving a lot of that EBITDA growth as well. But I think that \u2013 I think, your analysis is pretty fair.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. And then Dan, while I've got you, do you have to pay down more debt to get to investment grade this year?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","I think when you look at it \u2013 I think our \u2013 with our cash flows continuing to grow, that's obviously in the calculation, the biggest driver. I think from an overall debt perspective, goal is to continue to reduce debt with free cash flow. But I think, we can continue to drive down leverage, as we bring National Harbor on, as we get the free cash flow \u2013 free cash flow from Borgata this year, continue to grow our same-store cash flows. I think, that in of itself will be the biggest driver of decreasing the leverage.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Right. But I mean, in your budget do you \u2013 do you have your budget paying \u2013 in your budget paying \u2013 and you are actually using cash to pay down debt this year?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Here in the U.S., yes, debt gets reduced through in the U.S. obviously, China is still \u2013 from a consolidated standpoint, China is still finishing up Cotai. So if you look at \u2013 if you look at the U.S. debt, that would come down.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay. And one last question for Grant, because he \u2013 it's 11:30 there and we don't want them to go to sleep. How do you perform in such a competitive environment, as Macau, as you open up this sparkling new building? Give us your thoughts on, without tipping your hat about how you're going to fill it up?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Thanks, Harry. Actually it's 12:38.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","My estimates are always wrong.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","You said it. I think, the critical point is, and you know \u2013 you and I've had conversations about this. We've been working for some time, as long as we've been building \u2013 building out our capabilities to drive acquisition. I think, it's very clear that, that it's not feasible to simply grow off the backs of taking share from others. And that's where we're building a plan of many components leading up to the Cotai, but more importantly driving forward after Cotai. We are very specific in certain targeted markets, where we think we can be stronger. We're also very specific in terms of certain channels that we believe that we can create opportunity for ourselves.","And the biggest challenge of all with dealing with China, and the diversity and the non-gaming activities is that \u2013 it's not about marketing to China, it's about targeting certain population centers, consumer and centers which have certain consumer characteristics. And so that's really where we're focusing ourselves on and then it all comes together because you got to have an attractive component of product within the facility that we think would be attractive and not just be considered as a me-too, and those are the issues that we're really focusing our attention on to provide that attraction and appeal.","And last of all, the great strength is we're going to be moving nearly 40% of the team we have from this property into Cotai, because what's really important is that we can have equal levels of commitments to the MGM's service excellence. So, in fact, when we're recruiting, we're probably recruiting as many people back into this property, so that that can release talent that we have to make sure that we can maintain the commitment, because at the end of the day, we really don't care which MGM they go to, as long as it's MGM, and as long as we can increase that share of wallet of our existing customers, and then obviously attract and retain those new customers we're looking for. So I hope that helps.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Yeah, it does. Thanks guys.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Harry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone. So just to maybe kind of talk about the targets and the outlook for 2017 again. As we \u2013 if we go back to the Analyst Day, you guys gave some pretty explicit growth numbers and targets that were, I guess, I don't think they were guidance, but they were potentially achievable.","And I think that number sort of kind of built up to about $3.1 billion of EBITDA in 2017. So my question is, could you help us just think through what are some of the puts and takes to get to that $3.1 billion for this coming year? And is that number still in play as you guys kind of think about your business today?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Hey, Shaun, this is Dan. Overall, we still feel pretty confident about the pace that we're on. I think, the one \u2013 the one thing that needs to be kind of factored into that analysis is obviously with the announcement that Cotai is shifting to and moving to later this year in the back half. That assumed a kind of second quarter opening of Cotai.","So I think that's a key component as you think through that Investor Day model that would need to be adjusted for this year.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But to make you say or to say it out loud then not a ton else, if we think about both cadence and total dollars of PGP, and flow through and revenue outlook not a lot else has changed, if you think about the organic components there?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, to me that's the major one that comes to mind and everything else is pretty minor in terms of the puts and takes.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And Shaun, I'll just add to that, it's Jim. Yes, the answer is yes. It's that we're frustrated with ourselves about the articulation of the quarter, the fourth quarter because we had a very strong year. Exactly the kind of the year, in fact, better year than we expected when we had in fact that Investor Day last summer. So, we are on track on all the operating metrics that we had worked on for several weeks leading up to that Investor Day. We're on track to achieve our goals right now, in the current quarter in 2017 and beyond.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then, the other piece is, and then another piece f that build up that's pretty big for the year then is National Harbor, and obviously we've been able to look \u2013 to dig through both revenues and now a little bit on profits. But, could you just help us think about a little bit more about sort of learnings and ramp up at the property, what are you seeing sequentially so far? And specifically, what's kind of \u2013 what are your thoughts on the cost structure there and margin structure as we move through \u2013 as we move through 2017 and the property stabilizes?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, the margins are on track to what we had expected. We expected low-20%s in terms of EBITDAR, remember we're renting land there, EBITDAR margins. I think that's what we had in the fourth quarter as well, right. And so, low-20%s, normalizing to the mid-20%s, as we continue to stabilize the labor that is always the issue that impacts margins early on. The revenue numbers have been really wonderful both on the gaming and non-gaming side.","And, as I said earlier, we're only scratching the surface in terms of loyalty marketing, casino marketing. It's been a remarkable success from a customer perspective, and the margins are improving.","So, we are very pleased. And in fact, we're capacity constrained, particularly on the weekends, particularly on Saturday night. So we have some tweaks on the profit margin side, and the expense side that we're drilling through, but I can't say enough about how happy we are with the opening, with the customer feedback, with the revenue, with the current margin levels, and our projection for increased margins.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And maybe just one final one on that one, is it the spread of sort of what we're seeing between gaming, which we obviously get from data, and then non-gaming, which we're able to look a little bit more at today? Is that pretty accurate and reflective of what we should see going forward in terms of what we're seeing over the business, or any material changes you'd expect as we see that progress?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","I think gaming is going to actually go up. I think, as Jim mentioned, we're just coming turning on our marketing engines. We're really \u2013 the table games numbers have been substantially exceeding the market, the slot numbers are also exceeding, but we think there's opportunities there to go up. The food and beverage numbers are really solid right now. So what I would envision is probably more gaming revenue as a percentage.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. We've got something to bring online, longer-term, more retail outlets, some more things, but we feel pretty good about directionally where we're headed.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everyone. Really appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead with your question.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Good morning, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Two quick follow-ups to some of the earlier questions. First on capital allocation with the dividend announcement. What's kind of the right leverage ratio for the consolidated company and how would you think about dividend growth versus buyback longer term?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","You want to do leverage first?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Hi, Stephen, this is Dan D'Arrigo. So on the leverage front, I think pro forma for National Harbor and Borgata, leverage at the end of the year is roughly around 4.4 times. So I think the goal is to continue to get that into a range of 3% to 4% \u2013 3 times to 4 times, I'm sorry, and continue to get that number down. So, we've made a lot of progress, but we're not where we want to be just yet, and I would say the ultimate goal is to be at this steady run rate over the next couple of years in that 3 times to 3.5 times.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","In terms of cap. Thank you, Dan. In terms of capital allocation and returning value to shareholders, we did spend about two years on this hoping that we'd have the day that we're having now, which is discussing returning capital to shareholders. And so we looked at share repurchases, and special dividends, and quarterly dividends, and then within the context of quarterly dividends, we did a very deep dive into what the precedent transactions were for companies that are initiating a quarterly dividend. And the average yield coming out of the box for companies that are initiating the quarterly dividend is 1.3%.","And we looked at that, we looked at what the lodging peers were doing and we looked at our free cash flow. And that's how we settled on the $0.11 in the first quarter and the yield out of the box that we're referring to.","I think we also heard from our shareholders and we believe at the Board that you want to be able to have an opportunity to grow that dividend over time. And, we believe given our forecasts internally on free cash flow, we'll be able to do that.","On top of that. I think, it's important to note that CityCenter, our 50% joint venture, that didn't get a lot of press today even though it had a record year last year, is sitting on a ton of cash right now. We have dividend cash back to the owners, Infinity World and MGM before, we'll likely do it again.","And so, is also the case, once we open up MGM Cotai, the opportunity of future expanded dividends at MGM China. The expectation at this time is, if these events occur, which we expect that they will, we'll be able to move that cash back to the MGM Resorts owners, the owners of those assets in the form of increased dividends, increased quarterly dividends.","And, at some point in time, we may view other options in terms of returning value to shareholders. But, at this time, what we believe after the analysis that we did, given what we believe to be rapidly accelerating free cash over the next several years, we'll be able to achieve our ratings objectives, our leverage objectives that Dan referenced, while still growing our business, improving our business, increasing our margins and profits, and increasing the amount of capital that we can return to our shareholders in the form of quarterly dividends.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful color. And Jim, you'd also mentioned, wanting to avoid any hick-ups on a quarterly basis just from a guidance perspective. I'm sorry if some of this is in the slides, which we're having a little bit of technical issues on our end, but beside from the tailwinds in the first quarter, what are some of the puts and takes to think about as the year progresses? Thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. We got into that a little bit, we \u2013 in the slide deck, but maybe we can get into it a little bit more here. Do you want to do it, Dan, or Cathy?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure, yeah I think, Stephen as you get to the slide deck, I think as we talked about earlier, the \u2013 later in the year, third quarter is probably our toughest RevPAR comp in 2017 versus 2016. That was up about 11% in 2016 over 2015. The \u2013 we'll have the contribution from Borgata all year and National Harbor as well, as that continues to ramp up.","There is the calendar shifts to be mindful of through the course of the year as well, and one of the other items that's a little bit unusual, but to just point out is, this is the year that our golden ticket in, ticket out patent runs out. And so, we'll have some impact over at the MGM Grand who owned that patent for years. They'll have some impact by about $10 million or $11 million in cash flow this year from the royalties going away with that patent expiring. So, I think, those are kind of the key 2017 issues.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","One less day because of leap year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","And February has a one less day in the \u2013 and the way the calendar actually works benefited the entire hospitality network in 2016 just the way leap year and the calendar fell, it actually increased RevPAR here in the U.S. overall just based on that unique calendar from 2016.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And, one last one if I could just on the convention business, you mention the need to optimize the spend of your attendees as you're closing on capacity. Was there anything unusual from the spend this year that you saw from the convention business on a per head basis from those visitors, or is there anything unusual as we think about next year in terms of the types of folks coming and their amount of spend? Thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, the spend is increasing, as with Chuck Bowling, who I'm sure is listening in. Hi, Chuck. He had a $100 million of catering revenue last year at Mandalay Bay, a $100 million of catering revenue just at Mandalay Bay. It's an all-time record. And so, it's a matter of \u2013 and, that's profitable revenue by the way, folks. It's a matter of the convention mix, which we talked about will have a record, and the cadence of conventions, particularly going into what were historically non-traditional convention months, which we don't have a non-traditional convention month any more. Every month is a convention month now in Las Vegas. That should \u2013 that is helping our revenue per occupied room, which is why I mentioned that we expect that will be the case throughout 2017. It's partly due to that.","And, thinking about the first quarter here, think about CON\/AGG, I mentioned that the first quarter of 2016, we had RevPAR up 8%, we just guided you to 7% for the first quarter of 2017, so in other words 15% over that two-year period of time. That's the best we've ever had over two-year period of time, 2010 and the 2011, the stack growth was 8%, 2013 and 2014, the stack growth was a little less than 15% above 2015. So, this is going to be \u2013 this two-year period of time is going to be best we've had in terms of RevPAR.","And in terms of margins, Corey, on the expense side, maybe you had something you wanted to say in that?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. It's interesting, as we look at every quarter, we constantly are looking at all of our expenses, including our payroll. And in particular, even in the fourth quarter when it felt a little tough, absolutely when we look at it compared to an expense per occupied room we're only up like 0.004%. And we're actually down over a two-year period over 1.6%, we're down over 1,100 FTEs from last year alone. So, we're constantly managing that expense, we're constantly watching it, and that with the additional revenue will only mean that flow through will continue to come through.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Best of luck this year.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Fong from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Kenneth Fong - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have the question on the Macau side. In fourth quarter, MGM China seems to have lost some mass market share in fourth quarter. So, just want to see is there any reason behind it? And also, before your Cotai, new project open, any strategy how you can defend your market share ahead of the new project? And what do you see in 2017, so far, especially on your mass market trend? Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","All right. Thanks, Kenneth. Well, on the mass market, it's pretty fair to say that we're in that construction period. As you know, we've just opened the dining areas, which was launched by our new restaurants. So, that they have some disruption because of we had a restaurant that was a fairly important restaurant out. So, we had \u2013 we did have some head count loss, but the bigger issue really was we didn't hold as well. So, I wouldn't say that our volume share was down, but we didn't \u2013 we just didn't hold as well. And I can assure you that having opened those restaurants back up we've seen that business \u2013 that business fought back. So, that's been looking pretty good.","In terms of Chinese New Year, I think, what we're now seeing in Macau is that we normally used to see that after the third day, fourth day, that the business would come \u2013 come \u2013 strengthen up. It really didn't come back this year until about the sixth day and even up until yesterday on mass market, in particular has continued to be strong right through that. So, I think we are hearing from a number operators that it might have been a little slower to come on. The city was very, very busy with head count, a lot of day trippers, and I just think that that probably is shifting some of the dining patterns pushing it further out, and I think that's actually better for us because I think the customers come in and they seem to be staying a lot longer.","And sorry, Kenneth, what was the last question you put to me, the last part?","Kenneth Fong - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd.","Just before your new project opens, how do you defend your shares?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","How do we defend the shares? Well I don't think it's about us defending shares, it's about our \u2013 that others wanting to retain share against us, right. Because obviously, as I said earlier to Harry, we're putting in play, what we know needs to be a very long and extended acquisition strategy.","So, building up to the opening, we want to consolidate our position in the Peninsula here, looking very strongly to how we can build first-time visit. And \u2013 but then put a marketing program in that really starts pushing out into the six months to eight months after opening, recognizing that the capacity \u2013 that the properties coming to the market now that the ramp-up is just longer.","And so we need to plan to make sure that we drive business not just for the first 60 days, we need to be in the black to drive business for at least the first six months to eight months putting in, building up our direct marketing teams, building up those channels that I was talking about. Does that help? Is that what you...?","Kenneth Fong - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd.","Yeah. This is very helpful. Yeah. Thank you very much, guys.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey guys, thanks. Jim, you talked about quite a bit kind of the margin impact in some of the delta relative to consensus in the period, and obviously, flow through and margins, but one of the things that I don't think we've touched on that, that could be somewhat responsible for the performance relative to consensus is the PGP.","Could you guys maybe take a second and outline 2017 in terms of incremental year-over-year EBITDA coming from the PGP, and maybe talk a little bit to the extent you can about what you expect from the program year-over-year in the first half of the year, as I assume that's kind of when we'll get the bulk of the incremental PGP benefits?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. I'll turn over to Chris Nordling, who knows this one inside and out, right Chris?","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","Yes, sir. I think what you're going to see, you have in the deck what the first quarter was last year and the second quarter. We're going to be about \u2013 the remaining $55 million is going to be split about 50\/50 in each of those two quarters, between the first and second quarter. So by the end of the first half of the year, we'll be ramped up at the $400 million level. So I think for your modeling, you'd put it in 50\/50 give or take between the two quarters.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And, just so I'm clear on that, you're saying, the incremental year-over-year will be about $27 million or so per quarter?","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, in that ballpark. Yes.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, Grant, if you said it I apologize, if I missed it. When you factor in obviously the lower mass hold which is what I think that you alluded to and obviously the higher VIP hold, do you kind of have a normalized EBITDA number for the 4Q?","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","We made a lot.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Grant ?","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","So do you want to answer that one...?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, fine.","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","Oh, there you go.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Did you hear the question, Grant?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","No, I missed it, sorry.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry, Grant. I can repeat the question. I was just asking around the normalized EBITDA for the property for the 4Q given the mass hold and higher VIP hold?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","So, how much was the overall effect?","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","It's about the same as the third quarter, so it's in that $15 million to $17 million range.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","$15 million to $17 million favorable and is that just on the VIP side or is that including the low mass hold netted against it?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","That's netted out.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's netted out? Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Jim or Corey, or Dan, can we just return to something that we were talking about a while ago, and that's on RevPAR. And, I just want to make sure that we understand there is a tough comp in the third quarter. And, Dan, you laid out earlier kind of how we should think about the cadence, but can you grow RevPAR in the third quarter?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yes.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yes.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, it will be positive?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yes. To be clear, yes. Every quarter will be up.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And then, can we just talk about National Harbor in the context of Borgata. And, have you already been integrating your Northeast marketing strategy? I know it's probably early, but Borgata has been doing very well, you called that out earlier. And I'm just trying to kind of figure out what the potential of that property could be now that it's under your ownership.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure. So, we actually prior to our National Harbor opening, Anton Nikodemus, who is in-charge of our regional offices has been coordinating and working with Tom Ballance quite a bit. Actually Tom is going to be in National Harbor in the next few days. They do some really good things at Borgata that we think not only can help us at National Harbor but also all of our regional operations.","It's a little early to get the benefit, mainly because they're not quite on M life yet. But, once they're on that, then they'll be able to cross market pretty significantly we think. And so, we do think there is opportunities there.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","What's the timing of that?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","We're hoping sometime in the second quarter, M life gets introduced to Borgata.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And, okay, that's helpful. And then, just, Grant a quick one on, I know you all reiterated that, there is no opening date officially announced yet, but when do you expect to have more clarity on the timing of the opening?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","I think as Jim said in his opening address, we have a board meeting coming up in March, that's obviously one of the big topics for us to go through at that time and we'll certainly have more clarity around that time.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is there anything since your last update in terms of what's kind of been holding that back, anything new or just kind of same?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","It's all those challenges that you have in any complex property is, we are creating some very unique first-time installations here and we are going to get them right, we need to get them right, we're just going to put the time and effort into get it. We're pretty comfortable that the market conditions are suiting us at the back half of the year, and we just think this is the right thing to do.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great, thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Felicia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks. First on Cotai, it looks like since last quarter the budget may have gone up by $250 million, so I wonder if you could give some color around that? And then, are you doing anything on just a preliminary basis, because right now your land concession requires you to be open by January, are you doing anything to sort of maybe just get a little bit of room there, if there were to be a delay of a few more weeks or months of that, that there wouldn't be any risk from that?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Corey, you want to take that first?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, absolutely. Hi .","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Robin.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Robin, excuse me, jump in. The budget increases, we're going to keep guidance from 3.1% to 3.3% how we have been looking at it. But there is some cushion in that, it's the way we have to trend up on the $100 million increments. And so that is new guidance. Obviously, the complexity time does cost some funding. We still think we'll be better off in the long run.","We have every assurance, so we're not going to give a specific date yet because we do ultimately want to get into more detail with our contractor, we'd like to meet with the government around the process of licensing and approvals before we can peg a date specific. That being said, we will definitely be open, in our mind, in the fourth quarter. And so, the idea of contingency into 2018, while always something we'll consider, it's something we're not contemplating right now.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. Just to help on that too, there is no chance we're going to need to have any kind of discussion with the government about the land concession, because we are opening it this year, in sometime in the middle of the second half. And secondly, the delta of increase is far less than Robin what you had mentioned.","So, like $130 million in total. And if you recall, that's about 11% total cost increase over the last what, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Three years.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Three years. I mean, the cost has only gone up about 11% in the three-year period, which most of the guys over there would have loved to have had. So, yeah, we're comfortable with this budget, there is a little bit of increase because of the time of when we're opening this, but we're willing to take that increase because of the time, because we want to make sure it's a good product when it does open this year.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just two quick questions on Vegas. One is just, I don't know if you can sort to quantify, how much of the 7% RevPAR growth in Q1 is the benefit from the holiday shifts from Easter moving into Q2, that's kind of helping Q1. Is there a way to help us think about that?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Do you guys know?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","No. We'll follow up with you Rob.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. We'll have to follow up.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","There is a little bit of a benefit obviously with the shift. But let us get you the right number there.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I mean, the big driver obviously is CON\/AGG in March. The RevPAR number in March is going to be enormous.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","There's also a shift in some of our in-house conventions, one or two that move from February to March this year from a scheduling standpoint. So, not only CON\/AGG, but a couple of our own internal shifts and timing is making March look exceptionally strong and a little bit weaker in February, because of that one or two convention move from February to March this year versus last year.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks. And then the last thing is in the slides you talked about one of the issues in terms of year-over-year in Vegas was, it looks like \u2013 you talked about $30 million, some of that was home related, but that $10 million and it sort of talked about G&A and media spend and I don't know if you gave color on that in your introductory remarks, I don't think I heard you mention what that $10 million shift was or...?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. We didn't, we should have. You want to hit it, Corey or Dan, or you want me to do it?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, happy to. It's really a timing issue Robin, in terms of what we did was we took a step back as we initiated some of our marketing efforts from a consolidation standpoint. In late 2015, early 2016, we took a step back, we wanted to play out and look at where we're spending our advertising and marketing dollars. We also had a new campaign rolling out that we're working on from a branding standpoint at not only corporate but the property level. And really wanted to make sure, we're spending the right amount of money in the right channels.","And so from a year-over-year standpoint, we're pretty consistent in terms of our spend. It's really a timing issue that hits the fourth quarter as we start to look at our branding and marketing campaigns heading into 2017.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And what I would add also Robin is, there were a few projects that were capital in nature, but expense-type projects clean up like the Marina at that had to get done in the fourth quarter. Even with those increases I mentioned, our total expense per occupied room is only up 0.004%.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. Thanks very much.","Cathy Santoro - MGM Resorts International","Maybe one last very quick question.","Operator","And we do have a final question from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I have one last really quick question. So on a same-store basis, your U.S. casino revenues were up 3%, your RevPAR in Vegas was up 3%, but your EBITDA was only up 1% and you have PGP in there? So can you just kind of give us the delta there? Did you just lose some very high margin business?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, we did. I mean, that convention business obviously is very high margin business. We were able to actually replace a lot of those rooms by leveraging our database and with the goal of driving profitability and less worried about margin. I think from that exercise what we've learned is, that database is golden. We've learned a lot of things that were positive, then we learned some things that we could do better in future quarters. What we replaced those rooms with were definitely a lower margin profitable business.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And just a couple of things as we add, just to clean up some things that were asked. Easter will be less than 1%, the calendar shift, so the 7% RevPAR guidance, Easter shift will be less than 1% of that. Flow through was asked a couple of times and it's clear we are comfortable with the concept, we do believe margin is going to grow, including in the current quarter, we expect flow through to be up. I think it was Joe asked about 50%, we feel comfortable about that.","In terms of PGP, Shaun talked about that. I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that once we are done with that $4 million program, we're done, because we haven't implemented all of the plans that we had identified even in the initial program. And as I said earlier, we've laid down the architecture for further initiatives, further ideas, and that's why we're confident for margins to continue to grow even when we cycle through that program. And the cadence of RevPAR, we're going to up, we look like we're going to be up all year; even with the tough comp in the third quarter we'll be up and certainly up nicely here in the first quarter, up nicely in the second quarter and the fourth quarter will be the strongest of the four quarters. And first quarter being the strongest probably of all, and third quarter being the toughest but still up.","Cathy, you want to add anything to this?","Cathy Santoro - MGM Resorts International","No.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Okay. Well, I know you have some other questions. Thank you all for joining us today. We've taken more than your allotted time and look forward to chatting with you soon. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for attending.

This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com. A replay of the call and electronic copy of the investor presentation we will refer to during today's call is available on the company's website. We furnished our press release this morning on Form 8-K with the SEC.","And on this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws.

Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in the company's periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is also available on our website. Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Jim Murren.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. I've got to say, I've the one been looking forward to this earnings call. We're excited to talk to you about our outstanding results and what we see going on, in the future.","We've also mixed it up a little bit, we provided for the first time a really strong investor deck, we encourage you to go through that, we had a lot of internal folks working on that and we think it's extremely valuable to understanding the MGM story.","We're clearly very pleased with our earnings results. We're also pleased that we've executed on the initiatives that we talk to you about. Our cash flows in the quarter were up 24% and our margins were the best that we've achieved since 2007.","We're going to have a lot of time this morning for Q&A, but I want to brag on a few key highlights in the quarter. First, I'd like to welcome to the New York Stock Exchange officially, MGM Growth Properties. Last week, we completed that incredible IPO. It was the largest IPO to-date this year, and by the way, it's the third-largest REIT IPO ever.","In the room, we have James Stewart our outstanding CEO and our CFO Andy Chein here and they are already hard at work, we're extremely pleased about not on the outcome of the IPO, but really more importantly what it means for MGM Resorts going forward. And I'm extremely excited about the future of both the companies.","Now look, we've talked about Crystals a few times, on our earnings call. We said that, if we got the right price for Crystals, we would sell it and we certainly got the right price. We sold Crystals for $1.1 billion, that by the way is a really remarkable 4.2% cap rate. This was the largest sale of a single enclosed mall in the United States in more than a decade.","As a result of that, CityCenter declared over $1 billion in dividends to its owners, of course, MGM is half of that, so we received $540 million in dividends. As a result of that transaction, in MGP, we've improved our balance sheet profoundly, that's a $1.6 billion of total cash that goes fully to debt repayment.","Now on the profit growth plan, remember, we announced that about nine months ago and we set ourselves some very ambitious goals and I'm incredibly proud of the fact that our results have far exceeded our initial expectations and have really been astounding.","We challenged ourselves to really redefine, literally how we operate every aspect of our business. And this required a comprehensive unprecedented team effort amongst the 40,000 people that were directly involved and the 63,000 total employees of MGM Resorts. And you can see the results, in the first quarter, our PGP realized $59 million of incremental EBITDA, and that includes our 50% contribution of economic interests of CityCenter. If you add that up, we're obviously ahead of schedule, because we had previously guided to achieving about $200 million of annual EBITDA by the end of this year. We also, if you recall, announced that we were committed to achieving a 30% EBITDA margin by the end of 2017, and you can see that we are clearly ahead of our forecasts on that as well.","I think relative to this point, and I hope you look at the debt, because we've talked about in some great detail how we're achieving this. I want to emphasize the fact that the culture of our company has changed, and has improved. And it has been now won of relentless attention to continuous improvement, and not accepting the way things have been done for decades upon decades in the gaming industry, and not simply looking for the fix or the quick buck, but we're literally changing how we conduct our business. This has permanent long-term accelerating implications for our revenues, our profits and the culture and the enthusiasm we're working for MGM Resorts.","Now, I know we're going to get a lot of questions on Las Vegas, the outlook on Las Vegas. So, let's cut to the chase and say we're doing great, and the outlook is strong. Last month, if you remember, we unveiled The Park, which is that entire entertainment district and a course, the T-Mobile Arena. What a start we've had there. It's only been a month, and we've hosted over 100,000 guests in the Arena and most of those people were visiting our Los Vegas, and most of the people that are booking new events are booking because they want to visit Los Vegas to go to the new T-Mobile Arena events, which of course is great for the entire town. A lot of energy there, a lot of energy in The Park, we've seen some great F&B numbers in that side of the Strip, and we think that the neighborhood only gets better, and of course we own the neighborhood.","Generally speaking in Los Vegas, trends are strong and it's lead by very robust demand in the convention business, but also great growth in our other retail and leisure channels. As you can see in the first quarter, our wholly-owned Strip resorts achieved an 8% RevPAR growth, that of course is better than the guidance we gave you, we guided to 6%.","And we continue to see great growth strength in that convention in corporate business. In fact, no deceleration at all inside and we're really proud of the fact, grateful that we expanded the Mandalay Convention Center when we did because it has allowed us to maximize the corporate business \u2013 high margin corporate business, while still maintaining a very solid and important tradeshow business. And because of that, we have a lot more flexibility to manage the largest portfolio of convention space in Los Vegas by a mile.","I know you know we have a tough comp in May because we had the great Casino event, the Mayweather and Pacquiao event in May, but we're off to a good start, really good start here in the second quarter. We had a great April. And as a result of that, our confidence in the quarter remains very strong and we believe we can achieve RevPAR growth of 5% in the second quarter, even though the month of May is an incredibly tough comp because of what I mentioned. And that's because we did so well in April and we're looking great in June as well. And we have a great calendar of events at all of our venues, T-Mobile, MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay.","MGM China performed well in the quarter, obviously it's a rugged tough market, cash flows have been impacted by the market and roughly by $9 million from a low hold percentage, but we see encouraging signs now in the mass business, and the key contributor to our profitability there is mass. So, that gives us good confidence.","We believe in this story, the long-term prospects of Macau. We're highly confident that the quality of what we produce in terms of our great employees, our great offerings, our great service not only at MGM Macau, but what we are going to deliver at MGM Cotai positions that company, MGM China for renewed and solid growth, and of course, Grant is on the line and we'll tackle any of those questions in a moment.","In conclusion, I just have to emphasize how deliberate we have been internally to execute on a plan that we promised to our board and we promised to you. We have literally fundamentally changed the way not only we are operating our business, but I've got to say, we're fundamentally changing the way operators operate in Las Vegas because we are the leader, we are doing better than anyone else here and people want to know how we're doing it and then they're trying to copy us.","We are the premier operator here and in fact, in every market in which we operate. And we are right to brag about the fact that we have the best properties operating at the highest level in every market in which we operate.","We're driving revenue growth, we're exceeding the revenue growth of the market, we're exceeding the revenue growth of our competitors, we're exceeding the revenue growth of the United States hospitality industry and we're exceeding the revenue, margin and profit growth of corporates here in the U.S.","We told you that we would be absolutely lasered-in on improving our balance sheet, and we sure have. And we're getting, finally, the credit from the rating agencies, in fact Moody's gave us a two-notch upgrade recently, and I expect far more of those type of announcements in the future. We are the preferred developer in new markets. We win when we go in. We won in Massachusetts, we won in Maryland, we're building strong there, you can see the progress of Maryland by the way in investor deck. It's going to be the most spectacular integrated resort outside of Las Vegas that exists, and I think the most profitable one outside of Las Vegas when it opens at the end of this year.","I have to say that looking at how we performed in the marketplace, we outperformed in every aspect. We are the leader in conventions, we're the leader in entertainment, we're the leader in gaming, and we gained market share. We benefited from the efforts of our PGP plan, our great cultural changes, our strong corporate finance and legal teams and we're incredibly proud of how we are doing at MGM Resorts. And we are as excited about MGM as we are about MGM Growth Properties and its future as well.","And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator and we'll take the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the incremental detail that you provided this quarter. I have two questions related to Vegas, both focusing on forward trends, booking trends. The first is, if you just take a look at the most recent booking trends over the last one month or two months for the second half of 2016 and into 2017, how is that booking pace and pricing? Jim, you mentioned that it's been pretty strong, I'm just wondering, if you can put a little bit of detail around that?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I'm going to turn it over to Corey, he's got a bunch of stuff in front of him here.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. Harry, the actual second quarter looks really strong and actually the third quarter even looks better just from a convention base. We're looking at significant increases in rooms. In both those cases, the price increases also, they're decent given where we are in the market.","So I think, when you look at that base and look at where the leisure and FIT's booking, we feel pretty strong about where we are right now.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","When you look at this back half of 2016, given the guidance of up 5% in the second quarter, is the back half at a similar rate or better?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Our third quarter continues to pace pretty strong, Harry. Fourth quarter is probably our toughest comp for the year, but that being said, we feel pretty good about how October and November is shaping up from a convention standpoint. And we think the back half of the year will be as good as the first half.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, Harry, we are at a point here, where \u2013 have we ever been better in terms of our convention bookings \u2013 we are right now at an all-time record in terms of the amount of convention space, amount of conventions we have on the books in the year, for the year, the amount of bookings that we have on a quarterly basis, that our convention mix, which was a record last year is going to be higher this year. And, yeah, it's a tough comp because we did so well in the fourth quarter last year, but we're off to a tremendous start. Do you want to say anything more, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think when you look at it from a percent of mix on 2016 will beat 2015, which was a record year and take us to a new number mark, as a percent of convention. And we're doing that with the additional space at Mandalay Bay, but we are still constrained to some degree in peak periods of how much space we could rent. And so we'll continuously look for opportunities to move business around and also invest in opportunities to continue to feed that business.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","So that leads to my second question, which is 2017, if you are already at a record mix of group. How much more can you push that in 2017, are you seeing it more in the shorter periods?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yes, we are. And also remember \u2013 yeah, we have more on the books in 2017 than we do now. And remember ARIA is adding 200,000 square foot \u2013 square feet of convention space and we're able to repurpose some of our other spaces here. Remember also with T-Mobile as a new asset, a really important asset in the market that frees up Mandalay's Event Center and sometimes MGM for more conference space.","So, we have over 3 million square feet of convention space here in Las Vegas. We obviously, vastly exceed our competitors. And we have more on the way and we have the ability with the great sales team to move stuff around. So, we fully expect to have a better year in 2017 on the convention business than we do this year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","And as a reminder, CONEXPO comes back in 2017.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","That's a good win.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yeah. That is a really good win. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Great trends.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, Harry.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody. Obviously, the 1Q contribution related to the Profit Growth Plan was ahead of what most of us had modeled. Jim, can you give us what some of the big buckets or the big drivers of that $59 million was? And I'm assuming it's a little bit more OpEx related than revenue related?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I'm going to hit the high points and then, I'll turn it over to Corey or to Chris. We studied a lot of great companies that have gone through a similar exercise. And one other things that the best companies have done, the ones that have had the best results, they've told us very clearly, they said, they establish a plan, the plan is based on initiatives that they and outside consultants help them identify. Then they setup a target number and no ones to get into it, they realize that some of those initiatives aren't going to work, but they find dozens and dozens of other ones they never even thought about. That's happened here in space.","Almost everything that we identified is working, but we have found dozens and dozens of other initiatives we didn't think about. And it's because we've changed the way all of us think about our business. And it's a big contributor to driving revenue as well, being more thoughtful at the front desk, being more thoughtful about pricing, being more thoughtful about our convention business, working together to yield the huge portfolio of properties that we have.","And as you can see in the deck, we got very strong results on the cost side and many thing \u2013 the exciting thing is, many of the biggest dollar initiatives are just being launched now. So, do you want to add some other points, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think in the deck, we go through a lot of those examples, Joe and everything from airplanes, to wine up-sells, to room up sells, to how we manage labor. We're about 45%, 50% \u2013 45% revenue, 55% expense right now. When it's fully implemented, we expect to be a third on the revenue and two-thirds on the cost. So there is still some opportunities on the cost projects that take a little bit longer to see the flow through, but we're extremely pleased with the way our teams are performing and have stood up to the challenge.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, I'm just looking at something Chris Nordling gave me, it's across every single department, right Chris. I mean, we're getting revenue profit growth in our casino departments, look at our slot revenue by the way. Here much more money we're making in our slot department than frankly our competitors or how we used to do. There is an example.","In our Hotel Division, our Entrainment Division. Retail which was never a particularly great department for us is a record year last year. Last year and it's off to a great start here. Our F&B profits, where we cut G&A. And really, it's across the board and Chris, how many people do you have working in the PMO office on this.","Christopher W. Nordling - CityCenter Holdings LLC","We have about 40 full-time running initiatives and team leads on all the projects, you know our best people.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","So, this is like a bunch of people in this room, sitting around a room and saying, could we dream up some stuff. There are 40 of our best and brightest men and women that have left their jobs internally within this company, going into a new job in this project management office and are driving with project leads that are even more senior to them, these would be property presidents, senior and executive vice presidents that are leading individual initiatives that are driving this effort.","So, I don't, and by the way, the other message that's really important on this, that we learned from the best and brightest companies. This isn't something that has an end day. This should go and go on forever. We're not going to go back to the way we used to run our business or frankly the way most companies run their business. And this is, as in the Japanese term of Kaizen, means continuous improvement, that's the way we are running the company now.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","And Joe, the other benefit that we're seeing that we don't count in these PGP numbers is just a laser focus on the operations efficiency. So just to give you an idea, we're down about 1,400 FTEs and probably 60% of that is PGP, the rest is purely operators being very focused on our proper staffing levels and making sure that we're as effective as possible.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And then I have a Macau question, I don't want, Grant to feel lonely over there. Grant, how much of this labor expense are you carrying at Peninsula that you planned to ultimately shift over to Cotai?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Ltd.","Well, at the moment, we particularly in gaming, and basically got all of them management, because management is in place, so it's probably around 500 FTEs.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And will they translate into dollar amount?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Ltd.","It doesn't work quite like that, but it's a significant amount. It's probably maybe 25 basis points to 30 basis points in margin.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Great. Thanks guys.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","And the next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just as you guys look at the 2Q to 4Q period and obviously, maybe looking at the 2Q more specifically, since you provided the plus 5% guidance. Would you be able to possibly breakout the various segments of the business, i.e. convention, leisure, other casino, et cetera and kind of give us the sense for where you are getting the most pricing power, which of those segments you're seeing the most pricing power, as you go through the balance of the year?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure Carlo, much like last year, we've seen good strong pricing in convention and leisure is right behind actually, in overall pricing and that trend has continued. Corey got \u2013 getting through the details right now, but definitely leisure and convention had been our two strongest segments.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. All retail has got to.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I mean if you look at our, what we're expecting from our websites and call centers, that number ADR impact will actually be higher than the guidance, we've given. And that's because, the solid book of base that we have. So that looks pretty strong, leisure channel looks strong, I mean it's pretty consistent across the board.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. I think Corey, if you don't mind, if I could follow-up on that. Just in terms of the percentage of room nights that are booked right now through third-parties relative to your direct channels, do you guys have any color on that, that you can provide? And is that possibly a future opportunity to drive stronger net RevPAR?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","So I think that trend is very consistent across the hotel industry right now, where you're seeing that business increased significantly, and for many reasons including the investments, that Expedia's put in. They are a very strong partner for us, I think there are opportunities with websites and our royalty program, to shift some of that business and that would obviously increase our RevPAR. I think we're constantly looking at it. We're strategically looking at it. I know some of the bigger chains have been very aggressive and how to attack that. I'm not sure that we believe that's the right strategy, how we use them with our other \u2013 with our FIT and convention strategy in maximizing RevPAR that way.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. That's a good point, Corey. I just can't over emphasize how unique the Las Vegas market is, and how different we are versus the broader U.S. And Expedia is another dimension of saying the same thing which is we're Expedia's largest customer here, and we have a very good relationship with them as well. And they know that we're the home team, we have 42,000 rooms here, no one anywhere in any market has as many rooms or has the higher percentage of rooms as we do in a rapidly growing market like Las Vegas.","So, we have a lot of programs, we work with all of our vendors that maximize and actually start with the basic philosophy that Las Vegas market is unique and you cannot look at the Las Vegas market like you look at New York. We have no new supply coming online of any major extent. We have rising visitation, we have improving room product, because of renovations we and our competitors are making, and we're a vital, vital market on the global landscape. So I read about what's the some of the other companies are having, we don't share that angst, but we're having a very good relationship and we're seeing growth in revenue in all of our channels, FIT, our retail business, our leisure business and we're able to do that, because of our unprecedentedly strong convention business.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe one more question on what's going on in Las Vegas because obviously, the trends there are great. But when we look at some of the non-room and non-gaming components, it does look like the trend across the wholly-owned resorts there actually still down a little bit, at least on the top-line basis. So, part of that's probably initiatives you guys have in place, but could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in some of those businesses? Any headwinds or anything you're doing to reposition, what you might be doing in retail, entertainment and F&B?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, maybe I'll tackle one of them. And Corey, will probably tackle the F&B, but on entertainment for instance, we made a strategic decision obviously, on our entertainment focus where that line item is down year-over-year, but that decision was when we teamed up AEG to build the new T-Mobile Arena, part of that deal beginning with this year on the opening was the MGM Grand Garden would become part of that joint venture.","And so, it's part of that joint venture that now is a least entity within the MGM complex. And so, we no longer report the revenues of all those events and that revenue is now basically just a minimum leased stream and that's in partnership now with the new T-Mobile Arena. We obviously manage the day-to-day and all of the programming at the arenas, but it's part of that joint venture.","So, there is some strategic decisions that we've made that obviously, has caused some of that shift. Obviously, we've had the showroom down at Monte Carlo for the new Monte Carlo Theater that will come online later this month, I mean later this year. And then in the first quarter, we also had for an extended period of time, The Love Show Was Dark over at The Mirage as we are making some modifications to the show and some enhancements with our third partners there, during the first quarter. So, we had a few less in-house shows during the first quarter.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And Shaun, what I would say is, you're right. We are strategically looking at our business and slot is a perfect example, where we're actually up in the tough market, but we're really driving the bottom-line. And we're up almost $12 million in profitability in slots.","On food and beverage, we're seeing pretty good spending trends there. When you have more convention business, some of that goes into the catering line. So, the restaurants are doing fairly well. We'll keep adjusting based on the changing market needs, I think The Park is the perfect example of that, the outlets in The Park are medium--priced, approachable. And we're seeing a lot of that, especially in Vegas to be able to give a diverse variety and change out some of the restaurants to adjust to where the market is now, but in general, I think we're pretty happy with this spend, we're being strategic about it, we're making sure that we make as much profitability, that's our main focus, and then to drive the top-line with that goal \u2013 that's where we're focused on right now.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. Maybe, just to sum those two good points up. We have meetings constantly on revenue per occupied room. Total revenue per occupied room and profit per occupied room. So, where we find opportunities to drive revenue and profit, even if it means shifting out of some departments into others, we will do that. And that would be something, I think you should focus on going forward as our revenue and our profit per occupied room, which is rising and that's a result of a lot of these investments that we're making in areas where we think the consumer is going to be more receptive to spend money.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you for all the detail. And maybe to switch gears a little bit, Dan, there has been a lot of, obviously, kind of big strategic moves that have \u2013 that impact the balance sheet here a little bit, and I was wondering if you can give us a little bit of outlook on the CapEx inclusive of sort of the expenditures required for Cotai, so we can \u2013 as people on the call here can begin thinking about the prospects for free cash flow as we look out to the openings of National Harbor and then Cotai in 1Q 2017?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure, Shaun. Our guidance as far as what we gave on our last call has not changed materially in any respects. We got about \u2013 over in Macau, we got about $1.5 billion in CapEx planned over the next 12 months. And largely those dollars, obviously, are all for MGM Cotai in getting that property to its completion by the end of Q1 next year. And that's how we see the largest CapEx development on the table right now.","National Harbor for the full year is pacing about $650 million to its completion by the end of this year, in terms of its overall cash needs and our maintenance and growth within our properties is roughly running in kind of a $425 million to $450 million range for this year. Springfield will probably be, the first order of business is, obviously, the site remediation and site prep work that the team is undertaking there and the first real construction dollars, will be focused on building the parking garage there, over the next 12 months to 14 months and that will probably be about $100 million to $125 million in CapEx for Springfield.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And by the way, a lot of us were just down at National Harbor. It's awesome. It is really unbelievable. So, take a look at the investor deck and see \u2013 usually when you do a rendering, that building doesn't turn out like the rendering, but you could see how we're following the vision here and the level of excitement.","We're going to have over 40,000 applications for those jobs that we're going to hire at the end of this year. And the workflows that we're seeing out of our great National Harbor team have been really spectacular. And the creativeness is going to be outstanding and the building is coming out really remarkably well.","Shaun Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The pictures are great. Thanks for that.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Just a...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just a quickie on National Harbor, I think in the release, it still says end of the year, do we have an exact date?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","No, it'd be in the middle of December.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","But probably second week of December.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","We're targeting December 9, but probably a month before we put a pin in it, but we're targeting December 9.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I didn't want to say that, Bill, but...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks for that, Mr. President. We're going to say middle of December and we're targeting for some date that Bill might have mentioned.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","Put pressure on me.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So I think I heard like November 27 or...","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","No, no, no. I'm not ruining my Christmas holiday. I don't know about you, it will be opened before Christmas.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. So to get to my real questions here. Regarding the gaming trends on the Strip, just with the 6% decline in table volumes, I was wondering if you could just call that out. Was that entirely due to Baccarat or was that also mass tables. And then assuming the growth in the non-gaming trend in Vegas continues, which it seems like it will. Just wondering do you think it's driven more by moderating gaming revenues or increased spend in non-gaming or both are \u2013 how are you analyzing that?","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","Right, who wants to take it, Dan or Corey, or Cathy, do you want to take that?","Catherine Park - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Well, the 6% decline in volumes, we actually did pretty well \u2013 most of that was due to Baccarat, actually, our non-bac table gaming volumes were up. So to answer your question, most of that was due to non \u2013 was due to Baccarat.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. So I think what we're seeing is, we held pretty well in Baccarat, the Far East is still hanging in there, although still struggling a little bit. But our national play is strong and you're seeing that in the non-Baccarat not only drop, but win.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And I'm just looking at some other things. China was \u2013 our play from China-source play was still down a lot and Chinese New Year was slow as a result of that. But as Corey mentioned, our other non-China Asian business, we've had good \u2013 much better results out of Japan, other parts of the Far East and that has helped, ARIA did very well and obviously we have a very large marketing team. So I think of course, we have the largest marketing team. So we've been able to move our emphasis on markets, where we feel like there is more fertile territory for developing customers, that has had an impact and we've been focusing more on domestic play.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And domestic is up...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Our rated domestic play has been up about 7% in the first quarter, offset by a decline in our international rated play.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then we've just been kind of looking \u2013 just get to my other part of my question, we've been looking at these \u2013 I think we've all been looking at these trends where we've been seeing moderating gaming revenues and increased non-gaming. So just wondering, if you could talk about that phenomenon regarding the people that you see coming right? Obviously, you're growing your convention business and is that kind of cutting into the gaming side of things?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think, my guess is and anyone can jump in, my guess is that our non-gaming revenues and profits will continue to grow more rapidly than our gaming revenues and profits. And part of it has to do with the nature of the business, part of it has to do the investments that we're making, expanding convention business, building arenas, hosting music festivals, developing more F&B product, and been able to find more corporate business, more hotel business.","The National business is going to completely be driven by the U.S. economy, the U.S. economy is doing well, better than I think the news would tell you. Certainly, we're seeing it, in terms of good play and in terms of the spending trends across our portfolio. And what we like about our company is we get to see all kinds of customers, the customers who check-in the Circus Circus and the ones who check-in the Bellagio and everything in between. And we're seeing, you can see this in the results, but we're seeing increased consumer spending in these areas. The International business is the one that has always been troubling to us ever since the recession and we don't have as much visibility, in terms of how that business is going to grow.","We know we are the largest market share provider in the high-end here in Las Vegas by virtue of having the three properties that cater to that, but I just don't have a visibility whether international gaming is going to grow. I do believe the national gaming is going to grow. It is, as Dan mentioned, but I believe that our non-gaming revenues and profits will grow more rapidly. Anyone agree or disagree?","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just quickly Dan, housekeeping. Just wondering what the current balance of your NOLs is and when you expect to be a cash tax payer?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","We're actually a cash tax payer today, not at the full rate given our foreign tax credits, but we're actually a cash tax payer today. And the NOLs are pretty minimal at this point in time, it's really based on our foreign tax credit at this point in time.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And how long...","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","For effective rate.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. Our effective rate, right now is basically about 17.5%.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then do you foresee in the, I don't know near or mid-term getting to a full rate?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","I don't see that really changing for the next few years.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Two questions. One is, I know you gave a lot of color by quarter on Vegas RevPAR, that's very helpful, thanks. But just wanted clarify should we \u2013 as we put that all together, is that still \u2013 you had talked about a 6%. So, your RevPAR outlook at one point, is that still kind of roughly on track if we put all those pieces together?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, Robin, when we gave that guidance, we thought we'd do around 6% in the first quarter. So, we're ahead of that pace at this point in time. So, I would have to say that if anything we \u2013 our confidence level has increased significantly since we gave that last guidance.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then on Macau, when you had, last quarter had pushed back the opening to Q1, one of the factors you mentioned was kind of market conditions. Now sitting here a couple of months later, how do you feel that market conditions? In other words, is there \u2013 actually answer if market conditions are kind of similar to what they were two months ago in your view that that opening to maybe even go past Q1 of 2017?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Grant, do you want to tackle that or Bill?","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","Grant, why don't you speak to the market, and I'll speak to the project.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Ltd.","Okay. So, when we were talking about market conditions, I think the other critical point for us is the timing of all the projects both in terms of logically the ramping up periods and we are seeing some \u2013 the ramp up is taking a bit longer. And the other component of that is obviously recognizing that Macau government is sensitive to bringing the projects on at a particular price.","So, we see some positive signs in the market in general. I think everyone is talking about stabilization and if you look at our numbers, our mass numbers are generating 86% of that EBITDA now. So, they're pretty strong. We had a really good April, so we're starting to see some traction and we are seeing collective quarters of that, so I think to get ourselves into that 2017, assuming that others get open as they say, they're going to get open, is probably good timing and then I'll turn it back to Bill to say, getting the project done.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Grant. In context to the project, Jim and I and others, Dan will be out for a board meeting later this month. And we'll make yet again another assessment. We're roughly slated to finish construction end of October, early November and then remembering the last part of this process really resides with the relationship between signoffs between ourselves and the government, which pushes into we believe end of first quarter, that may trickle over that, but I think, we'll have some real clarity on that around the month once we have hands on view yet once again of where we are.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. So, the Bellagio, had the highest EBITDA in entire Vegas market, for the first quarter since the second quarter 2012, so it's quite achievement. So, EBITDA was up $26 million, $27 million year-over-year, can you just talk about what drove that and expected sustainability of the performance? Thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. Thanks for noticing that and not only that, but its outstanding margin. And if you have some time, you might want to compare it to its competitors in the market. Maybe also, look at how many rooms Bellagio has versus its competitors as well. We've been able to drive really great growth in our room product, we renovated those rooms. They have been received extremely well. We've added a couple very popular F&B outlets. The convention business is extraordinarily strong at Bellagio, to a point where we're studying on a preliminary basis where could we add a little more space here, because it's an extremely good problem to have. Our slot and table business has been outstanding and this is the best property in Las Vegas and it improved it in the first quarter. Corey, do you want to?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think it's general across the whole property. We're seeing increases not only in revenue, but there are probably \u2013 we've always had our luxury properties benefit probably the most from the PGP and so, you're seeing it on the expense side also. Slots have actually an all-time record in the slots for the first quarter. So they are just \u2013 it's quick in on all engines, I think the properties never been better, the upgrades we've made with the restaurants and the facility have all been well received. We have some new executives in there that are really clicking and really taking the property to the next level. So I think when we look at it and you look at the margin there, the margins are always been right up there, with any luxury property in town and then now it's beginning to outpace any property even by that much more.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","And keep in mind, because it's sometimes frustrating to us, that Bellagio is not our only luxury property, it's not the only property that we dedicate our energies on our International and National Gaming business to, it has two other formidable competitors in ARIA and the MGM Grand. So, if you were to look at those properties and then obviously ARIA had a great quarter as well and as well as the Grand and think about how we're doing, vis-\u00e0-vis the marketplace in any aspect of the business. I think there could be only one conclusion is that \u2013 for this quarter at least and I think it's going to continue, MGM Resorts is the best operator in this town.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then pass over to Grant. Grant, two quick questions. We just had made Golden Week, what does that feel in the market during that week in your opinion? And then there has been some talk about banning all proxy or phone betting. What your thoughts about the potential ramification there? Thank you.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Ltd.","So, on your first question. As I said, the end of April was really excited, gave us a good month. And then the Holiday has been quite good and is run through probably next two days or three days. So, we were all pretty satisfied, came out looking pretty good.","The key issue for us was we saw some customers come back and we're applying at some really good rate. So, we're starting to see some traction with some increased volumes, that's what the trend that we're looking for. On the proxy betting, I think it's saying \u2013 it's going to be a government announcement in the next few days to clarify the situation with that.","And clearly, our position will be that we will follow the direction of the government. As I said 86% of our EBITDA now comes out of the mass, so whatever happens in the notion of proxy, it will probably be yet another continuation of pressure for the junkets themselves, but it probably is not going to be that significant for any of the operators, certainly not significant \u2013 that significant for us.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning, three questions. First, just on the costs saves, when I hear you all speak about them, they sound similar to somewhat with The Mirage, MGM merger, reductions, the expense reductions during the financial crises, are these opportunities, Jim, that just naturally escalate and you have to go back every few years and that's why you're saying the culture has to change? I just wanted to understand that little bit better. And then any sort of EBITDA guidance on the JV operating income, CityCenter comes out because of the sale of Crystals, what can we expect in terms EBITDA from the T-Mobile Arena JV and any operating income, do we expect operating income from the JV broadly to be down year-over-year in 2016. I'll leave it there, because it's a multi-part questions.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. I'll tackle the first one and then \u2013 and anyone jump in on that. Interesting insight. And I think there is some points of comparison, but more I frankly more stark contrasts, so when MGM and Mirage combined back in 2000, it was really a focus on eliminating duplicate positions, eliminating duplicate corporate functions, consolidating areas that had been completely utterly independent and then to a degree that we were able to do 16 years ago, try to use a larger scale for better procurement and it really was more, I think, a function of some one-time if you look at it, savings, it really impacted positively, impacted the margins of Mirage Resorts in the year, so post the May 2000 acquisition.","Then fast forward to the Mandalay Resort Group, we basically did the same thing. What we did here was, from the very beginning, we were conscious not to try to do \u2013 go down that path. We already felt that our labor is at one point, the largest variable cost. Our labor expenses were reasonable. We have been tracking FTEs since The Mirage acquisition days and our FTEs have been flat to down, and more importantly, we look at labor in a lot of other metrics, labor per occupied room, labor per food cover, labor in a ways that would show and I think we're going to have an Investor Day coming up that will show you that, our labor costs have been decreasing along the way.","So, in this case, in the PGP, it was really challenging ourselves to do things very, very differently, where \u2013 how we procure. What kind of procurement policies do we put into place, how do we pay for our product? What kind of terms can we generate? We've been reducing the number of vendors that we deal with in every channel going from dozens of different vendors to a handful, and what that does to stability of product and pricing. Looking at more thoughtfully, how our volumes are being generated and using technology that did not exist in 2000 to schedule and use our buildings more efficiently, making investments, we didn't buy any planes when we bought Mirage, we sold planes. We bought planes, not because we needed new planes, because we needed more efficient planes and the planes that we have today, the only fleet of its kind in this industry operates at half the operating costs of the traditional fleet and that's important, when you're spending hundreds of hours a year per plane flying customers into Las Vegas.","And looking at really how we are leveraging also different game types, different products on the casino floor, I have to say it's a very different program than we had before. And I think that it really speaks to \u2013 and I could tell you as someone that was there on both deals. We didn't have a 42-man and women PMO office that was reaching out. We didn't have [Bain] initially.","We didn't use the resources that are available today to change the culture of our company. And so I would think that did we \u2013 did we have expense creep, which is kind of part of the question, probably after The Mirage acquisition. When everything was great, we're having record years in 2005 and 2006 and 2007, and we thought we were really smart and we turned out that there are a lot of things we could have done better, but this is a very different program and we're using technology more than we ever did before.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And the other thing I would add, Jim, is we are really focused on centers of excellence and bringing new skill sets into our industry, including areas like analytics where the industry has done an okay job, but now we're going into much more advanced analytics, that help us match our forecasts with our labor needs, with our customer service needs, and we're very focused on constantly improving that customer service experience.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Why don't you brag on her for a moment.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","On Elisa.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, sure.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","We just hired Elisa and was not just hired, she has been here probably like six months. Elisa Gois, she came from Host Marriott, no, just Host, right.","Catherine Park - MGM Resorts International","Host Hotels & Resorts.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And we're happy to have her here to stand up an analytics team. Now what we used to do is we used to have analytics teams at every property with a multiple layers of people.","So the FTE cuts, that you are seeing here are more strategic, more business-oriented and more permanent and they're relating to inefficiencies of an old way of doing business, compared to new technologies, new methodologies that are out there for us today.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And I think, once we get you all in a room, we're going to show you some of these things. We talked early on about the employee dining room where we were wasting so much food, which is really \u2013 it's criminal to waste the kind of food that is wasted in the United States. So we reduced our food waste to provide a better product, but providing in a fashion that is more efficient. What we do in terms of linens and terry, our programs there have changed dramatically. What we're doing in terms of amenities and supplies in terms of \u2013 how many \u2013 Chris how many different kinds of shampoo bottles did we have?","Christopher W. Nordling - CityCenter Holdings LLC","16.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","16? That's a smart move. So when we put the two big acquisitions together, we had some big high-level things we knew we needed to accomplish and we did, but from the ground up here, this is a very different program. And I think the next question was on CityCenter.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, Steve, I think it was on your guidance ...","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","JV.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","On JV EBITDA and their contribution. So as you know, we don't give EBITDA guidance. What we did do in the investor deck is we did highlight some things for you to consider as you're modeling out, some of the impacts at the joint venture level. CityCenter comes to mind, obviously with the Crystal sale, that will be discontinued ops as you saw in the first quarter going forward. There'll also be a gain on the sale of Crystals in the second quarter and there is some final depreciation adjustments in the Zarkana Theater for April that will hit the second quarter as well. We laid all those out in the investor deck.","I think the important thing to note on these joint ventures is, when you look at CityCenter, you look at Borgata, these are balance sheets that are less than four times leveraged. They are throwing off a significant free cash flow and that is a huge opportunity for the owners of these assets going forward and obviously, we own both 50% of Borgata and CityCenter. And I just saw with the Crystals dividend, I think you will see more dividends and more free cash flow opportunities from these joint ventures going forward, more so than we have in the past.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think when we made \u2013 I think we made it well \u2013 remember, when we made our 30% target goal, we also said at that time that this company MGM Resorts would be an investment-grade company in a very short period of time. Obviously, with these two major transactions, the Crystals and the MGP transaction, we've accelerated that timetable even further, that combined with the dividend potential of all of our enterprises including MGM China as soon as MGM Cotai is opened, and the free cash flow we're generating, gives us great comfort that we're going to get there in a really relatively short period of time.","Steven Eric Kent - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks for those insights.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Steve.","Catherine Park - MGM Resorts International","We'll take the last question.","Operator","The final question comes from the Steve Wieczynski with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. So, Jim, I guess the first question. I know it's still early on, but with the T-Mobile Arena opening up about a month ago, can you just give us some color around? So when there is a big concert and I know Billy Joel was there and some stuff like that \u2013 what did the trends look like at the properties around the Arena?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. We've had better attendance on these shows than we had predicted. We have had far greater activation by the sponsors. They are hosting their own parties, whether it's obviously T-Mobile itself or Toshiba or the other main sponsors, that generates not only revenues for the joint ventures, but activation in the area. We've seen tremendous numbers out of the Beer Garden and the leased venues that are along the park. We've seen improved gaming numbers at both New York-New York, and The Monte Carlo, slots and table volumes are up, and specifically event-driven tremendously. And it's not just in that finite area, it's radiating around, so if you go around at New York-New York to Tom's Urban for example, or go to The Nine Fine Irishmen or wrap around the corner in front of Monte Carlo, you're going to see double-digit gains over 20% gains in bars and lounge revenue and profit.","So the foot traffic is up tremendously, we think that the programming, we've had some events in The Park itself, that have been really fun, activating The Park has its own place for art festivals and food festivals and that has generated \u2013 and by the way it's generated a lot of local interest as well.","For us that live here in town, we know that you've really come to the Strip unless you're working like we are or you got someone from out of town visiting. But we're finding more and more locals coming down and going to Harlem Globetrotters or going to The Killers Concert or Billy Joel, and we got a big fight this weekend by the way, and we're activating The Plaza as well.","So really extremely pleased with the result so far and it's got us very excited about the future of Monte Carlo, something that I've alluded to in prior calls. But we've taken a good look at this building and believe that amongst our entire portfolio, it has the most profit upside through a repositioning. And so we've been working as you know on that as well and there will be more to come and when we're prepared to talk about it.","Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color. And then second question, real quick question. I don't know, if you will be able to answer this or not, but when you look at The Grand and you talked about The Grand being a pretty formidable competitor to The Bellagio. With The Garden arena there now, and I guess you look at The Grand only having about 600,000 square feet of convention space. Is that something you guys would look at basically changing out relative to the number of hotel rooms there? I guess, I'm trying to get as The Grand seems like it has probably not as much convention space as it possibly could need?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","We are \u2013 we've been for the last five months undergoing an internal inventory review of our entire portfolio here. And what we don't want to do is, build and expand too rapidly and then not being able to fill that space going forward, we're just be \u2013 we're trying to be very thoughtful on to knowing what the trends are, which are extraordinary in 2016, 2017, 2018. But trying the guesstimate what we're going to be in 2018, 2019, 2020 and that's harder obviously.","The one property that that stands above our others in terms of an obvious ones for growth of convention business is the MGM Grand. The MGM Conference Center was built the year I joined the company.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","That's right.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And it was built and located, because there was going to be a development that would've more seamlessly connected the MGM Grand to the Conference Center, that development we stopped. And so, that's an area where there's no doubt given the 5,000 plus rooms, given its location proximity to the airport, it's brand, it could fill off a lot more convention space and the good news as you know about convention space, it's the least expensive space to build.","And the ROI on the Mandalay Convention expansion is outstanding and we didn't talk about ROIs, but I'll just stand on this point, if you think about the way we're spending our capital today, because we have no intention to building a new full-scale resort here. We are spending a lot of money here, but in areas where we believe we'll have immediate, and very strong returns. And I would say the 5,300 seat theatre at Monte Carlo is a really good example of that. When that opens up next year, or late this year, Bill Hornbuckle has got a line of people, he'd kill me if I announce.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International",".","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","He is reaching over the table, but believe me, Wynn, we're going to be able to announce a series of A-plus residency acts that will occupy that and make that investment, that $90 million investment, a very good return for us. So that is how we are viewing capital in the Las Vegas Strip, is looking for ways where we can build on our strengths and spend a manageable amounts of capital to drive above average returns and one of those areas where we think we can do that at the right location is in the convention space and I would say that MGM is on the top of that list.","Steven Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks a lot. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Steve. And, Gary, I think that brings us to our allotted time of an hour. I know we got started a little bit late, but we're clearly and obviously around all day-to-day to enter any follow-up questions and we greatly appreciate, everyone, for joining the call with us this morning.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

Please note this event is being recorded. Now, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Steve. Good morning and welcome to the MGM Resorts third quarter 2017 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and we have furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Sorry, we're a couple of minutes late. I know it's been a busy day for all our investors today with many calls. Before I get into our very strong \u2013 obviously, very strong third quarter results, I want to take a moment to remember the 58 innocent people who lost their lives and the hundreds of more injured people because of evil individual that made a decision to carry out a devastating act of violence. Of course our thoughts and prayers remain with the victims and their families as they recover from the senseless tragedy, as well as the victims of the most recent attacks in Sutherland Springs, Texas and in of course New York City.","I also again want to thank the first responders and the various law enforcement agencies who are working diligently to examine the events of October 1. We have always appreciated their support and during this trying time and we continue to work with them through this investigation. This heinous act of one person impacted our entire city and community, but in the days and weeks following the outpoint support we've received from fellow Las Vegans as well as our guests, partners and corporate leaders from across the U.S. has been heartening.","We've also now learned of incredible acts of bravery by many of our own. Security officers and employees that help alert police to the shooter's location, employees that drove victims to hospitals, while under fire, delivered potentially life-saving first aid, worked with first responders to assist the wounded and led those in harm's way to safety.","The morning after, 500 MGM Resorts employees from all across our properties arrived at Mandalay Bay. They immediately assisted staff in the front desk, service in guest rooms, answering phones and ultimately ensuring the needs of our guests and our colleagues.","We've worked very hard especially over the last few years to foster a one company culture. This was not easy. Our operating companies have spent a great deal of time and effort to implement best practices across every aspect of our business including guest service standards, systems training, marketing, communications and this support system was put to test last month. And I've never been more proud of the strength of our employees who showed selfless dedication and spirited teamwork in the face of such unspeakable evil.","Our strong culture and operating model that we've built over the many years allowed us to take rapid and coordinated action and I'm gratified to have witnessed this genuine embodiment of our one company one culture easels.","Despite the tragedy, Las Vegas continues to move forward. While we anticipate near-term impact, which we'll of course talk about in detail, we're confident in the resilience of this community and its ability to remain the leading entertainment and business destination for the roughly 43 million people a year that visit us.","Now, let's talk about the third quarter results. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our business model and, obviously, we exceeded our guidance in the quarter. We produced consolidated net income attributable to MGM Resorts of $149 million.","Our domestic resorts on a same-store basis produced the best EBITDA quarter in over 10 years. Our margins and profitability exhibited strong growth as a result of the execution of the strategies that we've talked about many times on these calls and the strategies we put to place over the last several years.","Las Vegas did particularly well in the third quarter in spite of the fact that the city itself faced over 140,000 fewer large-scale convention attendees year-over-year. And obviously you see that we more than delivered. And the reason why is we brought some of the best experiences to town including two of the highest grossing boxing events at T-Mobile. We had a great group calendar. We drove spend across the board with all our business segments. And the end result was 4% growth in the third quarter net revenues to $1.5 billion on the Strip.","We generated $514 million of Strip EBITDA, that's up 14% from the year ago quarter. And RevPAR growth of 4.2%, significantly above our guidance. Our margins grew more than 270 basis points year-over-year to just over 33.5%. And we achieved several records in the quarter at many of our properties. I guess start would be Bellagio, where its margins were almost 42%. First time ever it reached 40% margin, and obviously the best quarter it's ever had in its history. We had higher table games hold of 26.8%, but, more importantly, we had 12% increase in volume. Even on a normalized basis, our Strip cash flow would have been almost $490 million and the margins would have been over 32%.","CityCenter had another great quarter campus wide. Revenues and EBITDA were up 4.5% and 17%, respectively. And it produced margins of 33.6%, up 360 basis points year-over-year. Aria had a record-breaking quarter in revenues, EBITDA and margins.","In Macau, where Bill and I were last week for most of the week, the market clearly has recovered quickly from Typhoon Hato, which hit Macau on August 23. Our teams have worked very hard there to volunteer to help recovery, both in terms of MGM China, MGM Resorts and our great partner, Pansy Ho, committed significant amount of money to assist and support the Macau community and its future. And that community is healing. We're extremely confident about Macau's long-term prospects and its evolution into Asia's tourist and leisure capital. We're opening, as you know, our second property in Macau. It's a stunner. And it will open on January 29 of next year.","We've spent a long time developing, designing, creating, programming a property that would be unique to Macau and certainly unique to the hospitality market. We've worked hard to deliver on a promise that we've made to the government to create an entertainment destination that's unparalleled. And I think when you see what Bill and I saw last week, you'll feel that we delivered on that promise of entertainment, of food and beverage, of retail, that's uniquely Chinese, uniquely Macanese, and embodies the idea of MGM as an entertainment company.","We're also excited to deliver The Mansion, which, of course, has been so successful to us here in Las Vegas. That Mansion product will be delivered to Macau also next year, which we believe will have a significant competitive advantage in the VIP business. And in the meantime, Grant, who is on the phone, and his team continue to do what they do best \u2013 best operators in Macau, most transparent, most accessible, best leaders of people. And that is going to be very evident as we move forward into the balance of this year and into a really important opening in 2018.","Looking ahead, obviously the event of October 1 has had an impact on the fourth quarter. The entire town did the right thing. We all took a pause in marketing out of respect for those affected initially. At that time, we saw a spike in non-group cancellations, actually a little more than double than what we normally see. Of course, our bookings declined immediately after October 1 because we were suspending our outbound marketing programs and focusing on what mattered \u2013 taking care of victims, their families, first responders, our employees and all the guests that are here.","I'm happy to say that these cancellations progressively subsided by mid-October and our booking pace remarkably returned to normalized levels almost immediately thereafter, as soon as we turned on our marketing efforts. Mandalay Bay was the lone exception because we felt it was appropriate to start their marketing later, at a slower pace.","So, to give you some color around the fourth quarter. About half of our cancellations were isolated literally to the month of October. And as I said earlier, we've seen bookings improve, our business improve, here in November.","On the group side, the support has been remarkable. All of us in this room literally were here in Las Vegas meeting with heads of large groups that were actually in-house at Mandalay Bay, Aria, Bellagio, MGM. And they all concluded the same thing, that they would not let evil win. They're going to host their convention, they're going to honor the employees of our community and they're going to do their work. And they did. And some of the largest groups we've ever had, including at Mandalay, said that we're going to, not only stay, but we're going to book again and again and honor the destination. And so, our booking pace going into next year is extremely strong.","We also have to acknowledge the fact that October, as you know, typically is the strongest month of our fourth quarter and actually usually one of the strongest months of the year. And so that is going to impact the fourth quarter revenues and profitability. And I think we're pretty clear on that in our earnings call that it has an impact in the fourth quarter. But, again, in terms of the cadence of the quarter, it's very clear that our revenues and profitability are improving since October. And we're going to talk about that just a little bit more in a moment.","It needs to be reinforced because we've talked about this before about why we invest the money we invest in Las Vegas to broaden out our destination, to increase our non-gaming activity and business, because it continues to yield extraordinarily high returns on investment.","The returns in our events, our arenas, our conference facilities are justified and enhanced and validated by the trends we're seeing in McCarran Airport, driving business and in overall visitation. And we see that in our forward bookings as well, as we speak. The analytics team, our revenue management team is the best in the industry and better than we've ever been before.","And so, we have high confidence in saying the following that we've already achieved 80% of our convention room nights that we've wanted to achieve for 2018 going into next year. This is an extremely high level for us in any time in our careers. We \u2013 actually we're going to be a bit better than that. But for the fact as you know, CON\/AGG, which is a very large citywide convention is not here in the first quarter next year and so that will impact the city in the first quarter. And also to a lesser extent, there's been a movement in CES by a few days which will have a slight negative impact on the citywide RevPAR. However, our ambient business, our strong business is improving and we expect to see RevPAR growth in 2018.","We are the leader in sports world. We've had kind of rough road trip for the Golden Knights but they're off to a great start and clearly been very popular here in Las Vegas, driving almost sold out crowds every single home game. We have brought in and they'll play next year a WNBA team. We've been very active with the NCAA in general, with the NBA, with soccer, rugby, NASCAR, bull riders, rodeo. Of course, we're bringing Dan's favorite, Oakland Raiders team to Las Vegas. All these individual activities collectively make a difference in terms of increasing visitation and more importantly for those who live here create a community event.","We're spending a lot of money as a company, improving our properties. Monte Carlo is rapidly transforming itself to Park MGM and NoMad. Many of the venues have already opened under great duress. It's been difficult from a construction standpoint, which obviously had an impact on its cash flows, but toward the end of next year you will fully see what we envisioned for that property.","And as I mentioned. COTAI is on the horizon, opens in January, and Springfield Massachusetts will be the home of our newest property, and our last major development project here in the United States when it opens in September. And that really winds down our development cycle, which accelerates our free cash flow profile, which we have articulated on many calls before but want to re-emphasize today.","Our goal has been and remains to maximize our revenues, improve our margins, which are industry-leading, thereby improving our cash flow, being very clearly disciplined on our capital expenditures and through our free cash, which we have and we'll return to our shareholders. We feel confident in our future for basically four points. One, we have a dominant position in all of our domestic markets and we alike (20:30) strength-on-strength, remodeling rooms, refreshing restaurants, finding new entertainment offerings, expanding our convention facilities. These are high ROI projects that yield great returns not only in the near term, but provide enduring value to our owners.","We have and will remain a fortified balance sheet, remain a strong credit profile, and that means that our leverage continues to decline, even though we are investing in our future and returning capital to our shareholders. And we have set a target internally and set it before to you, but our target leverage is in the 3 times to 4 times range. And we think we're going to get there by the end of next year. We're well on our way just to touch over 4 times right now.","Last quarter, we again took out higher coupon debt and it seems like every quarter, but again last quarter rating agency improved our ratings. Thirdly, we are very prudent and disciplined in our growth opportunities, there are not many that we find attractive. We like what we own and operate. We like investing in those tempo properties, but we are not looking for growth for growth sake. And in fact, if there's any project or any opportunity in the world that the team here in Las Vegas are focused on, that would be here and in Japan.","For growth, look to MGM Growth Properties with James and Andy at the helm. They are not only growing rapidly through their relationship with MGM Resorts, but are hot on the trail to expand their portfolio of owned assets with multiple tenants.","And finally, and importantly, we intend to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders. We've already done so this year. We've returned over $500 million of cash to you in the form of dividends and share repurchases so far. We announced a $1 billion share repurchase program, only a few months ago. We are committed to our dividend, not only its current, but to increase it over time, and we feel that that is the right path to reward the people that have been with us on the journey that we've been on over the last four or five years.","So I know we have a lot of questions, we've got a plenty of time to handle them, but I just like to emphasize that I'm incredibly proud of the men and women of our company. How we have navigated this company over many years to this strong foundation of growth and financial success and I'm also more recently immensely proud of the men and women and the community at large that have handled these horrific times that we have experienced over the last month-and-a-half. We will focus on what is important to our business and to our customers and to our employees and we're confident based on our analytics that we are on the way to recovery already.","So with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session And the first question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Jim, for your comments. I had one question in Vegas and one for Grant in Macau. In Vegas, I wonder if you could give us a little bit more of your strategy with respect to reintroducing Monte Carlo and what disruption has it caused, but what kind of returns on investment are you likely to enjoy there?","And then secondly in Macau. Grant, it seems to me that some of your competitors who aren't necessarily VIP-oriented have recently kind of dialed up their marketing efforts and I'm wondering if the competitive environment just for VIP has shifted at all in the last quarter or two. Thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, Harry. I'll start and I'll maybe turn over to Corey, who's got a cold, he's soldiering through. And then we'll turn over to Grant. We \u2013 I underestimated the impact of the disruption at Monte Carlo. It has been incredibly disruptive to the employees, to the guests, the building has been under the most comprehensive renovation of any property that we've ever undergone. And it has had a meaningful impact on its cash flows for the last couple of quarters, and that will continue into this quarter and probably into the first quarter and start rapidly improving in the second quarter.","When we have open venues and we've only opened a few new ones, they've been profoundly successful. A couple new restaurants, the room product as it's being unveiled to the customers has been extraordinarily highly received. The returns on capital on Monte Carlo, I would say, would be some of the highest we've ever committed over the last five years, well in excess of any new build.","Just imagine the fact that it's a 3,000-room hotel that we've added a $90 million theater to and now $550 million underway, taking a property that is well-positioned geographically, but poorly positioned in the market to a property that is right at the center of the Strip and with extremely high brand recognition and that's driving a lot of revenue. So, I would expect very high returns and I would think that Monte Carlo's cash flows, once they become fully integrated as Park MGM, will double. So that's the kind of project that I think you should look toward the future for us.","It is straddled over three years, so it fits within our capital expenditure guidelines that we've set for ourselves and articulated. But it is a very attractive way to deploy capital and that's where we're focusing our capital is where we dominate, which is here and obviously in Las Vegas. And if we are right on our expectations of Monte Carlo and its returns to Park MGM, that bodes well for our other existing properties in Las Vegas. So, I'll stop there.","Do you want to add anything else?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Harry, from a pricing perspective, our goal is probably within a few years to ramp up to our total strategy because there will be a transition period as Park MGM is introduced and NoMad is getting completed. But the goal on this project is we believe there's an opportunity to price this product right around or above a Mirage-ish or MGM-type property. There's not a lot of product in the town with that. We think there's an opportunity from the Park MGM perspective to hit that sweet spot. The NoMad will be more on the higher end, and should be priced with some of the luxury properties. But, overall, that's the overall strategy with the property.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, Corey. Grant?","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joseph Greff with JPMorgan.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Sorry. Harry, do you want me to finish that?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. We lost you there, Grant. Go ahead.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Sorry, Harry, I think we're seeing as you've noticed the strengthening in the VIP market across the board. And I think what everybody is doing pragmatically is taking that opportunity as it seems to be settled. And we're the same; we're obviously positioning ourselves for COTAI and building out VIP for COTAI. But even in the Macau property, we will be opening a new VIP Room, bringing in a new operator in December.","So I think to your point, yes, there is a focus on VIP, but I think it's probably because after a very quiet few quarters and almost over two years, we're now seeing some growth. And I think everybody is just repositioning and rebalancing their portfolio in that sector. Thank you.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Grant.","Operator","Hello?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Operator, I think we had a question from Joe?","Operator","Yes, Joseph Greff from JPMorgan, please.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody. And, Jim, thank you for the earlier comments. A couple of questions here. Looking out to 2018 in Las Vegas, can group room nights exceed 2017 levels or is the CON\/AGG rotating out in the 1Q just too much to overcome?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","CON\/AGG is I think too much to overcome.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, look, our goal is always to maximize that base around the 19%, 20%. CON\/AGG will be a little bit of a challenge. There is a chance we can get there, but it's going to be a tough challenge.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Said another way, would you expect 2Q through 4Q group to be up in 2018 versus Q3 through 4Q 2017?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yes. After we get through the first quarter and obviously the city-wide rotation, we expect group business and overall RevPAR to be up in the balance of the year.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And, Grant, hopefully you're still there. But how much VIP product will be open on day one of the COTAI opening? And when does The Mansion product open?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","So, at the opening we'll have our own in-house VIP. And I think as we've indicated earlier, we wouldn't have junket initially, but we do have a program to bring that online as quickly as we can. So that is a focus for us. At the moment, based on the construction program, we're looking to get The Mansion, again, online before the middle of the year. And we're just going to work as quickly as we can.","Clearly, bringing the junket and The Mansion and ramping up the VIP all needs to come together because we've got to be up to service that customer at the level we know we want to and make the impression that Jim indicated we're going to create with The Mansion.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then one final one back to Corey in Las Vegas. Monte Carlo disruption in the 3Q and what you've disclosed to expect into 4Q is a little bit under $20 million. When does that disruption piece \u2013 is it really middle of 2018 before we see no disruption impact?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","I think, yeah, at the end of the first quarter, we'll have the property rebranded. But we'll also be doing about 600 rooms in NoMad. So, there'll be a little bit of an offset there. But in general, most of the disruption, or at least EBITDA decrease, should end by the first quarter.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I don't know if you've been out lately, but, literally, the exterior of the building the signs are down. It's being refaced from the exterior. It's incredibly challenging to navigate in the interior. And there are pockets of really brilliance in terms of Primrose and the Steakhouse and the lobby area \u2013 but it is literally a full-on construction project right now and it really won't feel like an integrated resort until the second half of the year.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone. And, Jim, thanks for all the heartfelt comments around the tragedy. So, I just wanted to follow up on Vegas and maybe we could drill down a little bit more on specifically 1Q 2018. As we think about the different things you are lapping, CES and \u2013 or the CES shift and then also the lack of CON\/AGG. Can use just help us drill down a little bit more in terms of magnitude on how much you think that could impact the year? And specifically, if you'd be willing to give us a range on what you think RevPAR will be down in the first quarter.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I'll start and then Dan or Corey or anyone can jump in. We \u2013 when we went into strategic planning back in July, we expected the first quarter to be flat to down anyway. But we expected the first quarter to accelerate after we got through that and we'd expect it to be up for the balance of the year. So, before October 1, we had expected that to be the challenge, we knew that would be the challenge. But we thought and we still believe today based on our really \u2013 almost non-existing cancellations and actually new bookings for 2018 that will be up every other quarter in 2018. But I think we want to quantify the magnitude maybe, Dan, or...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think Shaun, it's probably a little bit too early for us to kind of get into what that magnitude will be, but in the next quarter we'll definitely \u2013 quarterly call we'll definitely give you kind of how we're thinking about the full year. But as Jim said, RevPAR will be up in 2018, challenging first quarter and then strength thereafter.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And we just gave guidance I think in the fourth quarter, didn't we, Cathy?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yes.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","All right, which was...","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","5% to 7% down.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Down 5% to 7%. So, we don't expect the first quarter to be down as much as the fourth quarter if that helps you.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. That's helpful. So, negative but maybe not quite as negative is what we saw in the fourth quarter is probably at least an assumption.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And what I would expect is what was down in the first quarter is probably the result of CON\/AGG and the shift at CES.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Right. So, if there is a decline it'll be for those city-wide reasons and it will not be as much as the fourth quarter.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much. And then maybe just as a follow-up. Can you just talk about sort of what you're able to do on the operating expense base, I mean, clearly, between the comp that you faced in Q1 and then just the overall business environment, which at times has been robust as it was in 3Q and other times, it's not quite as robust. I mean, what's the natural rate of expense growth and is there any incremental expense growth that might occur a little bit?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","So, this is Corey. I'll answer it. Even in the fourth quarter, we were down 3% in FTEs, and I think we have our engine pretty well dialed in to match our labor with our forecast. And in particular, in Q4, even before the incident, we usually go into slow period plans, which we accelerated.","So, we will hopefully be able to offset any cost increase there. As we operate in the future and a lot of PGP initiatives, they're all driven to constantly increase our margins over time. And so we believe, based on what we have in place that we'll be constantly be able to do that and therefore manage the labor, in particular our biggest cost through our new technology that we're using.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And as we've said before, but it bears repeating, our goal is to increase our EBITDA margins 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year, and that remains the target that we feel is achievable. We've obviously come off a tremendously strong third quarter. And therefore we'll have a good year with our nine-month results already booked overall, but we expect to continue to not only drive revenue growth in 2018 but margin growth as well.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone. Good morning and condolences. Corey, Jim, Dan, whoever kind of wants to take a stab at it, but the large-scale conventions relative to smaller groups which you guys have done a great job this year backfilling, especially in the third quarter versus kind of events, could you talk about the dynamics of maybe not down to profitability, but the dynamics of how those events are different for you guys from an earnings perspective as we look at next year. And maybe you have some holes to fill in the first quarter with CON\/AGG moving out and some of the other puts and takes throughout the back half of the year.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, I'll start and then I'll move it to either my left or right. We have \u2013 and I'm sure Mike Dominguez and his team are on the call listening in as many of our thousands of employees are listening and many of them are shareholders of MGM. We have the best convention sales team in the world, not just in the gaming industry or in the United States. And what we have been able to accomplish in terms of booking conventions, moving conventions from other cities, improving the portfolio of product, standardizing our delivery of product, filling in calendars where we no longer have any real slow periods in our calendar for conventions has been remarkable.","We had pre-booked the expansion to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center before we even started construction, and it's been remarkably successful. And we're expanding the MGM Grand Conference Center as we speak and already pre-booking into that expansion.","And we're looking for other growth opportunities as well including in the building we are right now at Bellagio. But the large group business of which there are still significant groups we do not get in Las Vegas or we don't have at MGM Resorts is significantly more profitable. So you want to share anything on that?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. What I would add, Carlo, is actually when you look at our business and in particular the large groups and especially if you saw it in October right after the event them being here sure helped quite a bit without having a major impact on our results. But in general, 60% of our business, or close to that, is corporate. And of that, the large groups are a small percent of it. And actually, a majority of our room nights come from the smaller groups, the large groups what allows us to do is yield our rooms a lot higher at those properties when that core business is in there.","It looks strong. It continues to look strong. Many of those groups book multi-years. And so, we have a lot of that tied up. We constantly are looking for actually larger groups to actually help us on our shoulder periods also. But in general, when we look at our Strip revenue and what those large groups have done, they've actually helped us grow the total convention contribution probably about 5% to 10% a year over the last few years and we expect that to continue.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. That's very helpful. And then if I could just ask a follow-up. Obviously, it's always volatile as experienced in the 2Q relative to the 3Q with hold swinging almost 600 basis points, but it does feel like the natural kind of bias relative to your normal hold, if you look back over the last, call it, seven quarters has been higher.","As you think about your theoretical range and maybe some of the tweaks that have been made around some of the games, does that range maybe feel a little bit like it's conservative and your experience of late is going to be more indicative of maybe the natural table game hold on the Strip going forward?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Carlo, this is Dan. I don't think the range is conservative. I think the approach we're taking with respect to our casino business over the last few years has really evolved into more focused on profitability overall as well as the customers.","So, as we've talked about before, certain steps that we've taken with respect to our customers are much different today than historically, and some of which we don't deal to any longer. So, we've taken a different approach. I think that's probably helped our ability to skew more towards a higher end of that range, and how we look at customers today, how we market, how we promote those customers and the deals that are cut with the customers I think has helped our theoretical and ultimately our actual hold percentages.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, I agree with Dan. I think we're still happy with the range because we dominate in the high end. We're bigger than our next two competitors combined. Note how much money Bellagio made again, if you can but compare that to our Strip competitors.","So, there is volatility in the high end and that's why I think at this point, we should keep the range where it is, but there's no doubt that the analytics around our whole table games department and the men and women that are working there has improved the profitability and also the hold percentages if you look back over the last several quarters.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys, very much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, Jim, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that the company returned to marketing at Mandalay Bay later than the other properties, for obvious reasons. So, just wondering if you could give us some more details regarding that property, perhaps maybe when did marketing start, what kind of demand are you seeing there once you did start that? And is there a percentage of the room base that's out of service?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, I'll start then because Corey has been probably the most focused of all of us. So literally on October 1, we shut down all our marketing channels. All external, internal channels Strip-wide. And if there's any affirmation that the people we have in direct marketing are worth the money that we pay them, it's certainly true that it has an immediate, instantaneous impact on bookings.","We felt that when we did start slowly bringing back marketing, started pivoting our external, our websites, our digital plans, we didn't start doing that until in the middle of October. I think it was late in the second week, wasn't it Corey?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","It was around the 10, 11.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Around the 10, 11. But not at Mandalay. Mandalay we took another week or two, didn't we?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, what we ended up doing in Mandalay is we probably took another week and then we started drizzling it out just to make sure that the reaction was not adversarial. And so, over time, it's at full force now. I would say that Mandalay compared to the rest of our properties probably has the most impact. We know that 20% of the cancellations came from there. But they're really close to where their booking pace was prior to the incident.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And as you know, we're so proud of our national ad campaign. We took that off air immediately. And that has not gone back up on air and probably won't go \u2013 I know it won't go back up on air until sometime next year. So, we're not fully back from a marketing perspective. We don't think it's appropriate to do so at this point in time. But in our direct marketing, here in November, all the channels are back fully functioning.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","And, Felicia, I'd like to make another point, too, just to add on. It wasn't just MGM Resorts. This was the entire community for about 10 days that stopped marketing the destination. So, LVCVA, ourselves, our colleagues up and down The Strip, as well as our partners on online channels, et cetera, really shut down any outward and forward-facing marketing efforts for that 10-day period. So, it wasn't just us.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","That's a good point, Dan. I mean, you'd have to be here to experience it. But this is a good point to say how appreciative we are at MGM of our competitors. We had pastries delivered from the Venetian. We had folks coming over from Tropicana. We had Cosmopolitan chipping in. We had folks at Wynn, Caesar's Properties. We all rallied around the same tragedy. And the city collectively and universally shut down its outward-facing marketing for the better part of a week and a half.","People had their own views on how to restart their programs independent to themselves. But it was certainly a collective decision by the community to pause, focus on the victims and the families and the employees and the community. And we're all turning on those channels now.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And can you say what percentage of the room base is back in service at Mandalay?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","All the rooms except for one wing of one floor.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for all that color. And, Corey, just when you think through the RevPAR stats that you reported this quarter, the strategy to focus on more profitable customers is really apparent when you look at the occupancy rates across the board. But what also stands out is the ADR increases that you generate at most of the properties, especially at the segment that you call the retail properties. So I was just wondering is that pure room rate lift, or is there anything else driving that?","And then I was just also wondering how much runway there was left to raise ADRs at those properties. I would think given the segment that it's in, it might be hard after a point to keep pushing prices.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","So, keep in mind, we thought it was going to be even a more challenging quarter going in because of the 140,000 less citywide room nights. So, we were able to achieve that even without that. And I think what drove a lot of the retail, especially in those properties, the two major events definitely helped quite a bit. But if we could layer on the events with the convention base, there are always opportunities to raise rates there. And the rates there are still below peak at some of those properties.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, that's actually a good point, Corey. I don't think we've talked about on the quarters. We have talked about a strong convention calendar for 2018, but we have an equally strong entertainment calendar at all of our arenas as well. And those big arena events drive ADR increases and it's not as episodic as it used to be.","We literally have every weekend now, it seems, a major event at either Mandalay Event Center, MGM Grand Garden or T-Mobile Park Theatre and our other venues and that has an instantaneous uptick in ADR when we have them.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Even when we look at the hockey games and many of us are seasoned ticket holders there. Half the arena is the other team. And there's probably a good portion of the other team that is coming in from out of town staying New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Aria, Bellagio, Excalibur even because it's close to the arena.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, they're not staying at Monte Carlo too much right now, it's under construction but they're staying at New York-New York and Excalibur, Luxor, Aria, MGM.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Felicia.","Operator","Thank you. And the next comes question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, a question for Grant, if Grant you're still awake. Can you talk about \u2013 how do you feel Typhoon Hato impacted your property if you can quantify? And do you feel like it had outsized impact given your location on the Peninsula? Thanks.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","I think it's true that the Peninsula properties had more dislocation, but frankly I don't think it had any eminent effect. If anything, I think it was just a timing issue. When you look at the GGR going into October, we've seen some good growth. So, it's one of those events, it's a tragic event that \u2013 it had a lot of damage caused and obviously a lot of dislocation in the community. But in terms of business, I think we are becoming really pretty robust and pretty resilient. And so, I don't see it having any permanent impact at all.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's it. Thank you very much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Catherine Park - MGM Resorts International","And maybe one last question please?","Operator","Okay. Thank you and that comes from John Decree with Union Gaming.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Hey, everyone. I just snuck in under the wire. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to kind of get a little bit more forward looking and when I think about convention mix, Corey, you kind of talked about 19% to 20% range and you've got two new items coming online early next year, the Aria convention space and then the year after at MGM Grand. Does that give you the tools that you need to kind of get back convention mix up a little bit more or is the strategy just to kind of target perhaps higher-priced groups in that space?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","So, keep in mind Aria is not included in our mix, but the goal of the additional space is, one, to look at getting better groups in there at higher rates. Two, to the extent it makes sense to place more convention business into a facility compared to the other business we could place into it, we will. And I think there's opportunities to improve that mix, but it's not the ultimate goal of purely sitting there and saying we want to be at a certain percent. We're going to maximize our profitability by using all the spaces we have and making sure we have the right groups in our rooms.","Catherine Park - MGM Resorts International","And to remind you, part of the impetus for us making the decision to expand our convention space was the existing groups that we have today were growing in size and we wanted to make sure that we grew with them.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Right.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Great. That's it for me. Thanks so much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We are working hard for you, our investors, our owners. I'm proud of our company. We are enthused about the future of MGM Resorts not only here in the United States with COTAI opening around the corner and we're very active in the pursuit of what I believe to be a tremendous opportunity in Japan and we aim to be a winner in that market as it unfolds.","And we'll be in touch with you. Please call us at any point in time and thank you for the time today.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

After the company\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please note, this event is being recorded.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Aaron A. Fischer. Please go ahead.","Aaron Fischer","Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International third quarter 2019 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com and we have also furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC.","On this call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today\u2019s press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.

You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release and investor presentation which are available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jim Murren.","Jim Murren","Well, thank you, Aaron. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019d like to give a thank you to Grant Bowie for getting up early in Macau and to Bill Hornbuckle for also getting up early, Bill is in Japan and a special shout out to Cathy Park who is on maternity right now with her beautiful son but I am sure listening in to see how we do today. So, let's dive in.","We had another busy and successful quarter with solid results that were in line with our expectations. Looking forward, we feel good about the fourth quarter and for the 2020 financial year given the continued execution of our MGM 2020 plan, healthy market conditions and the ongoing ramp of our newer properties.","Before I get into the results, I want to start with the work of our real estate committee. If we recall the formation of that committee was in January and that was another step in a process we began back in 2016 when we formed MGT to begin to maximize the value of our own real estate assets. Since then, we've continued to shred non-core assets that do not align with our strategy while investing in assets that actually complement our strengths.","The results of the committee's work with management and advisors supports and in fact accelerates our transition to an asset light business model. For MGM, asset light means separating the ownership of capital intensive lower return assets and recycling that capital into high ROI opportunities. The recently announced sales of Bellagio\u2019s real estate to Blackstone and Circus Circus to Mr. Ruffen are important milestones to that end. And I think it's important to spend a moment focusing on Bellagio agreement.","That transaction was the product of exhaustive analysis of our asset base and significant time spent on developing a structure that would maximize the value received for our shareholders, while minimizing friction costs. The Bellagio deal wasn't just the sale of a property, we've done that many times, but rather it represents one of the most sophisticated agreements this company has ever entered into, and a process that has led to a partnership with one of the world's leading real estate investors. These transactions were key steps but by no means the end of our journey.","The Bellagio real estate transaction represents more to us than a smart financial deal. It provides a likely blueprint for the future. In fact, a process to monetize the real estate related to MGM Grand Las Vegas is now well underway, and we anticipate sharing more with you on that before the end of this year.","We're confident that the Bellagio sales sets a new benchmark for gaming net lease transactions and will help us deliver the best possible outcome for MGM Grand. We would also of course will evaluate ways to maximize the value of MGM Springfield, our 67.7% stake in MGP, and our 50% stake in CityCenter.","We\u2019re really excited about the phase that we're in now. After a lot of work, we can see what our end state will be, and anticipated future MGM Resorts that does not need to own meaningful real estate assets. Monetization of our real estate assets will allow us to achieve a fortress balance sheet with very low core leverage while investing in high return, growth initiatives and simultaneously returning significant capital to shareholders.","This asset light transaction and transition should result in meaningfully higher free cash flow per share, lower leverage and a more flexible financial structure that allows MGM to better capitalize on its core competencies as a developer, manager and operator of leading gaming and entertainment properties. With our unmatched portfolio of brands, leading customer database and expertise in managing hundreds of restaurant, shows, concerts and gaming concepts, we're confident that MGM is positioned to reward shareholders with continued growth.","Between the Bellagio and Circus Circus Las Vegas transactions, we expect to receive estimated net cash proceeds of about $4.3 billion reflecting approximately $250 million to $270 million of cash taxes and about $250 million of the expected debt breakage costs and other transaction costs.","We expect to use the majority of the proceeds from these initial transactions for debt reduction with the remainder for capital returns and given current market conditions, we expect to promptly utilize the remaining $750 million of our outstanding buyback authorization this quarter.","So, now let's talk about our results. The third quarter came in as expected with consolidated net revenues up 9% and adjusted EBITDA up 14% year-over-year to $814 million. Here in Las Vegas results were solid driven by strong demand across all of our segments with the exception of Far East baccarat.","Our convention business remains exceptionally robust, non-gaming revenues increased by 6% with RevPAR up 3.6% Gaming revenue declined by 3% with table games down 12% due to ongoing softness in Far East baccarat volumes. This was somewhat offset by slot revenues which increased 4% in our domestic table game business which was also up.","Our Strip EBITDA increased by 5% to $441 million and on a hold adjusted basis, Strip EBITDA was up 6% year-over-year to $438 million. Our third quarter Strip EBITDA margins were 29.3%, up 40 basis points year-over-year.","Our regional properties continue to perform well in the third quarter with net revenues up 20% and EBITDA up 27%, with the majority of the growth from the inclusion of MGM Springfield, Empire City and Northfield Park, National Harbor and Borgata both delivered strong results during the quarter. And once again, we're very proud of our regional portfolio with leading market positions in just about every market we're in.","MGM China's net revenues grew by 22% $739 million and adjusted property EBITDA was up 40% to $182 million due to the continued ramping of MGM Cotai. This represents we believe excellent performance given the various disruptions in that marketplace.","By property, MGM Macau achieved EBITDA of $102 million, down 14% year-over-year which reflects weakness in the market. MGM Cotai continued its ramp with $80 million of EBITDA, a 48% increase compared to the $54 million in the second quarter. Our Mansion product is ramping up very nicely.","The VIP segment continues to have some challenges but does not represent a significant portion of our cash flows there and we gained market share in mass market, which remains very resilient and of course as always Grant will be on the line to answer your questions.","We continue to make excellent progress on our MGM 2020 plan during the quarter achieving all of our targeted savings and revenue enhancements, some of which were on an accelerated basis. As a result of MGM 2020 initiatives, we were able to achieve revenue initiatives and cost savings of approximately $50 million during the quarter.","We continue to be on track to hit $100 million in adjusted EBITDA uplift this year and increasingly confident that we will meet or beat our $200 million adjusted EBITDA uplift goal by the end of next year. Of course Corey is here to provide any detail around that.","Looking out further, the fundamental backdrop in Las Vegas remains encouraging and we see healthy demand in nearly all of our business segments. Our convention bookings in Las Vegas continue to shape up nicely and we are on actually on track to hit a record mix of convention room nights this year of 20% for the full year 2019 despite citywide convention nights being down in the fourth quarter.","And 2020 is expected to be a particularly strong year for the convention business in Las Vegas given favorable citywide rotations such as CON\/AGG and of course we're also excited that this city will be hosting the NFL draft for the first time. And while leisure booking windows are naturally always shorter, we also see favorable trends there in 2020, which particularly support our legacy properties.","The Far East baccarat business continues to remain a challenge here in Las Vegas. And of course, we also face a tough comparable from the prior years\u2019 quarter when volumes were strong but our live entertainment calendar in the fourth quarter remains extremely strong with the return of Lady Gaga and Aerosmith at Park Theater and of course we're excited about the opening of our latest Cirque du Soleil show run at Luxor.","We also have a strong sports calendar with two boxing events one this weekend, the Alvarez fight and the Deontay Wilder and Luis fight coming up plus of course Vegas Golden Knights games, the PBR World Finals and UFC 245. And with the current NFL season underway, we're getting closer to the opening of the Raider Stadium next year, which will be a very positive catalyst for our South Strip properties notably Mandalay Bay and Luxor.","By the end of 2020 through continued execution of our asset light strategy, we intend to have domestic net financial leverage of approximately 1 times excluding MGP. On a consolidated basis, we expect to be between 3 to 4 times and on a leased adjusted basis leverage 4 times.","We also remain on track to achieve our stated goals of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow per share of $3.50 by the end of next year. This will be driven by healthy market conditions in Las Vegas and I think our regional properties, the ongoing ramp of newly opened properties, the benefits of our MGM 2020 plan and our disciplined capital allocation strategy.","As we have been discussing, our major capital projects are complete and all of our resorts have never been in better condition. And accordingly, our CapEx is dramatically lower which will result in accelerating free cash flow. We remain focused on opportunities that we believe will create long-term shareholder value including Japan, sports betting and by continuing to evaluate and execute on transactions that unlock the value of our real estate.","Just yesterday, we were excited to announce a partnership with Yahoo Sports. Our goal is to have the most comprehensive in interactive sports betting platform in the industry. By combining the retail and sports betting operations of MGM and Roar, which is our joint venture with GVC, with Yahoo's fantasy sports and digital content network, we are creating a very dominant partnership.","We believe that when people watch, experience and consume sports content, they will be motivated to bet on sports and everyone I just mentioned will benefit from that. And when you combine two world-class brands such as MGM and Yahoo who both share similar philosophies regarding sports-related content, you have an opportunity to create the ultimate user experience. And part of our sports strategy is driving increased visitation into our properties. Yahoo's 60 million users will now be able to experience what MGM Resorts is all about. We're bringing the best of our Las Vegas and regional properties to them online.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph Greff","Good afternoon everybody. My first question is the question I wanted to touch on Jim you kind of touched on as well about the, about looking at monetizing the real estate of the MGM Grand. Can you talk about, I guess why that maybe taking longer or was outside of the real estate committee recent sizable activities?","And then can you then talk about maybe the timeline for proactively monetizing and seeking additional value from some of the other real estate that you referenced on slide 6 of the presentation of the earnings deck?","Jim Murren","Sure, Joe. First on MGM Grand, management and the board of MGM felt very strongly that the best way forward here was to create precise execution on our most valuable asset. We were evaluating all of them, all at the same time but we felt rather than trying to accomplish everything at once, the best way forward was to focus on Bellagio, particularly when we got into an exclusive phase with Blackstone and we were able to work together very constructively with that organization to achieve frankly a multiple on rent that was inconceivable even earlier this year, let alone a year ago.","As you know, Joe, last trade of Las Vegas Real Estate was at 14.25 times and we achieved 17.3. That's three turns, that\u2019s $750 million more of value to the MGM shareholders because we focused on our prime asset with the best possible counterparty.","And so we felt strongly that that would set a benchmark and provide a blueprint for transactions for the MGM Grand which is equally valuable, no doubt one of the premier assets here in Las Vegas, a top five profit performer for over a decade. And now, we've turned our sights to that.","And because of the work we've done over the last several months on Bellagio, it makes the timing and the work streams for MGM quicker and a lot easier. And so, we believe that this was the best form of execution to tackle projects one at a time and with deliberacy which has led to these gross proceeds and more importantly, or equally importantly, net proceeds that we've achieved.","So that's why we decided on Bellagio and now we're moving into MGM Grand and of course, we'll be evaluating our EBITDAR OP units, our MGP stake, MGM Springfield, etcetera in due course. The second half your question was what is on the \u2013 could you repeat that, Joe?","Joseph Greff","Maybe talk about the timetable for items beyond the MGM Grand.","Jim Murren","Oh. So, we expect to close the Bellagio real estate transaction and Circus Circus, Las Vegas this quarter by the end of this year. We expect that we'll be to, we\u2019ll be able to talk to you all about how we're going to how we're going to transact the MGM Grand Las Vegas Real Estate, we expect to be able to tell you that by the end of this year, which obviously would bring you into early 2020 before most likely any transaction will be completed there.","And it's not mutually exclusive to the other real estate related work that the committee is doing and management is doing. So, expect more to come over the coming months in early part of 2020.","Joseph Greff","Great. And then my follow up Jim and this might be counter to a lot of things that you're talking about but maybe just to kind of get this out there. Maybe you could discuss your appetite in acquiring [indiscernible] in conjunction with other real estate activities and if it\u2019s leverage neutral, particularly if it's in a market that you're currently in and geographically makes sense.","Jim Murren","Sure. We're not engaged in any M&A right now Joe. We're not interested in acquiring anyone else's assets at this point in time or anyone else\u2019s operations. We're really focused on what's in front of us right now. We think that's the best use of our time and our board's time but we are a dynamic company. We\u2019ll look at things as they present themselves over time but I would not want anyone to believe that we're looking at any of that over the near term.","Joseph Greff","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling","Hi thanks. I guess one follow up on the asset sales, are those changing \u2013 how you think about capital expenditures at the property level and or how you're prioritizing investment renovations?","Jim Murren","Not at all. No. As a triple net we and as the operator of these assets that actually is \u2013 make these decisions very easy for us because the real estate transactions themselves are relatively once you get the leases worked out straightforward financial transactions. The capital that will go into the properties is within our control and will be consistent with the capital spend that we have deployed over the history of the properties.","That was something that obviously our counterparty with Bellagio, got very comfortable with given the amount of investment we've put into Bellagio since MGM acquired Bellagio in connection with Mirage Resorts way back in May of 2000.","So, we've been the operator of Bellagio for most of its life, 19 years of it, over 19 years of its life and we are going to be the operator of it based on a lease for about 50 years whoever's here at that time and we'll continue to invest in the properties whether they're wholly owned properties or whether they\u2019re leased to a third party. And as I said earlier, they're most likely going to be leased to somebody else.","Stephen Grambling","Helpful. And then maybe changing gears to Macau, looks like you're seeing a nice ramp in Cotai. But can you talk to any cadence over the quarter, any impact as you see it from the situation in Hong Kong maybe how that might dictate how that will ramp as the year progresses? Thanks.","Jim Murren","Thanks. Actually the Hong Kong situation is somewhat independent of us but I think obviously, it\u2019s a little bit confusing we haven't seen any direct impact. I think visitors are starting to change their travel strategies.","So, we just got to keep our, keep our things valuable and make sure we promote [indiscernible] unfortunately a separate destination and make sure that we can allow those customers to come in and get in and out of, out of Macau effectively. So, nothing really there.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks, I'll jump back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Hey. So, just starting on capital allocation, so obviously, you're bringing in a lot of proceeds through the asset sales over $4 billion. Can you say \u2013 tell us like your strategy or your methodology about balancing buybacks with taking down leverage. Thank you.","Jim Murren","Sure. First it\u2019s \u2013 I think it's important to reiterate what we believe our end state is and how \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we are here that we are actually can see the end state which is going to happen over the next year or two. The end state is that MGM Resorts is going to be asset light. It will continue to invest in assets because it will continue to invest in the properties, all the properties that we operate.","And it will make investments into bricks and mortar and into technology but in areas we believe will be higher return on investment investments than simply owning static real estate and it will be done on a more of a global basis with an emphasis not only on our gaming properties that we operate but also on non-gaming hotels, on sports, on technology on entertainment. So, that's the end state.","In terms of you know why that's important is we believe there's a large experienced economy out there that MGM Resorts and certainly not our competitors, are actually tackling properly in these areas of entertainment and sports in Japan, etcetera. We believe to best do that for shareholders, we should reduce, significantly reduce our financial leverage. And so, it's an overarching priority to get that core leverage, that financial leverage down to 1 times by the end of next year.","We believe we can do that while repurchasing shares and focusing on our dividend and investing in Japan and investing in sports through joint ventures and otherwise. And we look at it all holistically. But it means being very disciplined on capital allocation, focused on that debt reduction, returning capital shareholders as we have been doing in the form of dividends and share repurchase, in making sure that we don't have less financial flexibility but actually have more financial flexibility, particularly because we're in the later stages of this economic expansion.","And as we grow our earnings base, over a reduced number of shares, it will have the impact of accelerating our free cash flow. And so, we look at it in holistically and we believe that given the assets we have, both what we have announced, but based on what we've announced the blueprint that we have achieved for future transactions, we're going to be able to very effectively achieve that over the next 12 to 18 months.","Thomas Allen","Thanks, Jim. Helpful color. And then just on CityCenter, you did $110 million for EBITDA and respecting that you had high hold, I mean that's the fourth quarter in a row that you've been generating pretty strong EBITDA there. Can you just talk about, update us on how you're thinking about where you can grow that property, EBITDA too, and kind of what's driving the success? Thanks.","Jim Murren","Well, ARIA and Vdara, all CityCenter of course, opened in the worst possible time. And it's right now next month celebrating its 10th anniversary. So, out of the great recession came a property that a lot of people were dismissive of and counted out 10 years ago, it\u2019s now one of the most profitable resorts in Las Vegas, and we believe will continue to be so and in fact, accelerate its profitability because it's new, we continue to reinvest in it, and we have been investing in areas where we had gaps before.","We did not have the right restaurant product when we opened up. We've been changing that very dramatically with great success. We did not have enough convention space. We just dramatically expanded the convention space there, and we have other ideas to increase its meetings capabilities which will drive revenue.","We had a poor performing show but now we have T-Mobile Arena and we have Park Theater, and we have a lot of entertainment that ARIA and Vdara benefit from, without having to have it on the campus. And we've been driving, consistently driving casino business through an improved loyalty program and frankly, better brand awareness of the brand new brand called ARIA.","As we evolve into our digital work that we'll be talking to you a lot more about in coming quarters, investing more in loyalty, we think that will accrue to the benefit of all of our properties particularly our Strip properties, and particularly ARIA because it's relatively new and still does not gain some of the casino business, it could vis-\u00e0-vis say Bellagio or MGM on the high end. And so, yes we're proud of what's happening there but we believe that from a delta perspective there is probably more room to grow cash flows at ARIA than most any of our properties.","Thomas Allen","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelly of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelly","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Jim maybe just to start maybe to stick with the capital allocation component. I believe in the prepared remarks you said something about promptly using your outstanding buyback authorization later on in this quarter.","Obviously there were some pretty substantial share repurchase in the quarter. Could you just maybe give us a little bit more color? Is this sort of the right run rate? I think it was around $350 million this quarter or can it accelerate with some of the proceeds that come in when you actually close on the Bellagio and Circus?","Jim Murren","I think it will accelerate.","Shaun Kelly","Okay, great. And then a second one is probably for a follow up but more for Corey. Just kind of digging into the 2020 plan, I believe the mentioned in the prepared remarks was around you already being at about a run rate of approximately $50 million in the in the quarter for contribution there.","Could you help us a little bit more with sort of the timing or run rate or bridge on that because I think as we look at kind of core operating expenses we would have thought they could have been maybe a little like lower year-over-year at least in Las Vegas. You did see a little bit of margin expansion but up against a fairly easy comp. So, any color you can give us on that would be helpful. Thanks.","Jim Murren","Sure Shaun on the margin expansion, leap in mind it was definitely impacted by the Far East play. If you exclude that, that was about 60 basis points. We\u2019re up about 0.1 on the Strip. The core properties are really where you're seeing it because there's less noise in this straight away. Comparable business, they're up almost 300 basis points on margin.","So, from that perspective, we're really happy with where the flow through is. Keep in mind the Strip is going to have increased expense because of Park MGM and the expansion of the food and beverage restaurants and really the full opening of the hotel, which will distort that.","When we look at it in particular, excluding Park MGM we're down about a 1,000 FTEs on the Strip. And so, we're pretty confident at least we're seeing on the labor savings on that. As we mentioned \u2013 as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had $50 million of recognizable savings in the third quarter sorry. And we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we like what we see going into the fourth quarter.","We have the fixed labor nailed, the variable labor components are in process, including the technology pieces and we've found some other opportunities in scheduling and in forecasting. The purchasing side is also going pretty strong. That's \u2013 that will come through monthly, so you'll start seeing. As we ramp up in some of those areas, you'll start seeing some increases in there. And I would expect the fourth quarter to be better than the $50 million.","Shaun Kelly","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Thanks a lot. Jim, can we go back to your asset light strategy and just on MGP, you've talked a lot over the time about reducing the ownership there. I'm just wondering mechanically like if you get a low majority ownership, how would you treat capitalized rent or how would you think about that that you would have \u2013 that would remain on your books as you divest that?","Jim Murren","Sure. So let's first start with MGP, and then maybe I'll turn it to Corey or something we could talk about capitalized, the lease or Aaron, or me, I can do it too. First, MGP when we created a few years ago, we were very focused on ensuring that we were disciplined around asset quality and tenant quality.","And as you remember, we brought that public, I think it was $21 a share, it's done pretty well. But what we're most proud of is it\u2019s stuck to its core strategy of not going out and buying a bunch of broken down stuff someplace and degrading its tenant quality.","And that, I believe MGP is going to continue to be very focused on. James Stewart and Andy are very lasered in on not only the financial characteristics of MGP, but the quality of its portfolio. Clearly, MGM Resorts is incented to encourage MGP to grow and if it came down to a transaction between a third party and MGP, we're always going to favor MGP in a close race. And there's a lot we can do that's mutually beneficial to MGM Resorts and MGP.","As MGP continues to acquire assets but only quality assets, as it continues to do so, it will access the capital markets and in doing so will reduce our stake in MGP. We would also look for other opportunities over time to monetize some of our equity stake as long as it was done in a capital efficient manner.","MGM Resorts is not wedded to any particular ownership of MGP. We've stated that at least in the near-term, our near term goal is to get under 50% but that won't be the end state. We will very likely own far less of MGP than that on a going forward basis. And so, I think the way, I would look at it is MGM Resorts has a strategy.","The strategy has become asset light. It is executed on one stage of that at a multiple higher than anyone could have predicted here at Bellagio. It sets us up very well to work on multiple other transactions, which include wholly-owned real estate, jointly-owned real estate and MGP itself. MGP owns more quality real estate on the Las Vegas Strip than anybody else and it's certainly being mismarked in the marketplace given where the trade was just announced with Bellagio even if you assume any kind of discount between Bellagio and the MGP portfolio.","We would never \u2013 you would never assume it would be as wide as it currently is. And so, we believe that there is a lot of future for MGP and MGM Resorts has no pre-disposed view on how much it owns or whether it owns any at all.","We also think the Blackstone deal is very important because it proves out the point that MGM is more than happy to transact with a third party on a lease in highly negotiated lease terms with someone as sophisticated as Blackstone where MGM has very little ownership in that new joint venture. We\u2019ll have 5% of the joint venture equity ownership. ","And I think that should be illustrative of how we view MGP and any other third party going forward is we do not have to control or even own a majority or even own anything at all of the landlord as long as we can control the capital expenditures, the operations, the marketing of the resorts that we believe are dominant.","And push on [ph] consolidation as long as we still own the golden share and we remain over 30% ownership we continue to consolidate MGP on our financial statements. If it drops below there, then we would end up with the EBITDAR type presentation.","Felicia Hendrix","Right. And then \u2013 but you also have the \u2013 it's not financial leverage but you have that leverage on your balance sheet. So, I'm just wondering how you're rectifying that, was kind of going more towards delevering story?","Jim Murren","We're still focus as we look at leverage and on the core operational stuff, we talked about 1 time in general consolidated, we're still focused between the 3 to 4 times. As long as we continue to consolidate MGP that's still in our targets.","Bill Hornbuckle","Yeah. And, of course, we've been in constant contact that Corey has and Jim Freeman with the rating agencies and we'll continue to focus on both consolidated leverage, lease adjusted leverage that either meet or exceeds, improves our preexisting financial targets. So everything that we\u2019re doing is for that.","Felicia Hendrix","Just so as we model that and kind of figure out scenarios in the future and how a variety things could look like, if we were thinking about significantly reduced financial leverage but having leased adjusted leverage, we should still use that kind of 3 to 4 times total.","Jim Murren","That's correct.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. And then just with the debt paydown, some of your longer dated bonds have pretty pricey make whole provisions, so I'm just wondering if you're looking at that as a foregone cost to any transactions?","Jim Murren","We have anticipated what we're going to do in the debt markets with the debt and also friction costs that we gave you just now. And obviously, we\u2019d be focusing on the near-term maturities where the premiums are lower.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. so you would likely \u2013 so, because I think some people might assume that if there was another transaction that you were just kind of use all that to pay down debt. But again, you're getting into some of the longer dated stuff so maybe you might wait. Is that fair to assume?","Jim Murren","We're going to look at everything and I don't think it's prudent for us to lay out our strategy on the call.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just finally on Japan, I'm assuming that would not be \u2013 I mean that would be a JV, but that would not be asset light.","Jim Murren","Not initially, no.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli","Hey, guys. Thank you. Corey, I know you talked about it a little bit just in terms of the$50 million. Is it fair to assume I think on the last call you guys talked about 60% in Vegas, 30% in the regionals and 10% at corporate. Is that kind of fair representation of the $50 million in the 3Q?","Jim Murren","Yeah, I think I would say regionals are probably about around 25%. You're going to end up getting about 5% that ends up at City Center. So, it's about 65% that actually impacts the Vegas market in total .","Carlo Santarelli","Okay. Got it. And then Jim on the last call, you talked a little bit about kind of this year and obviously I think at the time you were talking about a consensus number for the Strip, that was around $1.7 billion. You obviously called out some tailwinds, some things that are beneficial in the fourth quarter as well as kind of a continued well-articulated VIP or high end Far East play that's kind of been a little bit of a headwind. As we think about the near term 4Q and into 1Q are you still pretty comfortable with the overall outlook?","Jim Murren","We are. We are comfortable with the Las Vegas consensus. We have \u2013 the only thing to think about as hold as whole beyond our control. Year-to-date, we've had I think about less than a $15 million negative hold impact. But yes, we're comfortable where the street is. I think the street is around $1.7 billion Aaron?","Bill Hornbuckle","$1.7 billion, yes.","Jim Murren","Yeah.","Carlo Santarelli","And then\u2026","Jim Murren","And the reason \u2013 just why we're comfortable with that, obviously, we're three quarters into it. We're in the fourth quarter we see what our business looks like in the fourth quarter. The convention and entertainment business is very solid this quarter. As just mentioned by Corey we're ramping up the MGM 2020 plan, so that \u2013 all that's within our control and that makes us comfortable that that will offset any ongoing weakness Far East play.","Carlo Santarelli","Great, that's helpful. And then just, I noticed in your presentation or I think in the release actually, there seems to be a change in the methodology of how you guys are adjusting for your hold levels. It seems like baccarat is an additional element and it looks like maybe that methodology was changed in the 1Q and to 2Q. Just holistically. could you kind of talk through what went into the thinking?","Jim Murren","Sure. As we look at our business and the mix of business between baccarat and non-baccarat, and also look at our competitors, we felt that there was a better way to look at it and we think our competitors probably look at it this way.","So, starting Q3, what we\u2019ve done is we've broken out between baccarat and non-baccarat. The normal \u2013 the range in baccarat is 25% to 35% which is normalized in the midpoint there would be 30 and on non-bacc, we're about 19% to 23% with the normalized range being around 21%. And so in the past, we've just used a blended rate and compared or hold that way. We think is more consistent with our biggest competitors on the Strip.","Carlo Santarelli","Great. Thank you very much.","Jim Murren","Yeah, that's some good feedback we actually have gotten from a lot of you. So, that's why we made the move.","Carlo Santarelli","Yeah, for sure. Thank you, Jim. Thanks, Corey.","Jim Murren","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question is from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Hi, good afternoon. Wanted to start in Vegas. Going back to 2015, your Vegas margin was around 26% and after the implementation of PGP, you've got pretty close to a 500 basis point lift. And the question is, what's a reasonable expectation for MGM 2020? You're starting from a higher level and so, is it, is it, is it reasonable to think that you can at least get half of what you got from PGP and is it sustainable?","Jim Murren","Yeah, Harry I think to your point we are at the higher level, so getting that first 500 basis points was a lot easier comparison but what we do believe is that as I've \u2013 as I mentioned we\u2019re seeing about 31% at the core properties. Our goal and we believe based on our program that we should be able to get to that 32% and that's even with costs increase with the union and labor increases. So, we feel pretty comfortable with that number.","Harry Curtis","Very good.","Jim Murren","Yeah. And I think, I think maybe \u2013 Harry I just add to Corey\u2019s which is a lot of the investments we're making now are investments that we think are much higher margin investments than what we were able to achieve back 5 to 10 years ago, particularly around loyalty, digital marketing, technology.","So, as we move into this \u2013 the end state of asset light it's not just reducing our bricks and mortar intensity it's actually increasing our human capital our human bricks and mortar to drive what we believe to be accelerating revenue and higher margins.","So, it's not so much a PGP like plan which was a cost cutting plan at its core. This is an operating model change and a focus on investing where we believe we can increase the utility of the buildings that we operate and drive revenue and higher margins that way.","Harry Curtis","Very good. I wanted to ask Grant a question. You gained a reasonable amount of share, revenue share sequentially and I guess my question is particularly with the premium customer, what are the challenges of getting mass trial met premium mass trial?","Your run rate this year and in EBITDA is somewhere around $750 million between the two properties, which is about 25% below your target. So, walk me through how you overcome the challenges to get to that billion dollar target. Thanks.","Jim Murren","Thanks, Harry. Well, I think the first thing is we need to get everything up and running. The Mansion is now online and all the villas are now available; getting really positive responses for that. And as we've mentioned before, that's now allowed us to move into another segment that we've really not been able to penetrate. And the progress of adding value in that \u2013 to that segment is actually going well.","We're getting huge trial in excess of 20% of the business for the quarter, directly attributed to Mansion as new business, not seems like before. So, that's really the critical point for us. On that one Harry you've got to basically pitch it to every component.","In terms of the other areas we're also trying to balance it up about not getting our reinvestment right ahead of ourselves and that's something we're also very careful about. In terms of run rate though just to follow on from the comment, once you start getting the main summit it start to build and we're starting to see continued strength in that premium mass business coming into the fourth quarter.","There's still some on the business transitioning out of some VIP business to mass but that's really what we're focused on is making sure that the products right, we target ourselves but at the same time balancing up the reinvestment costs. But clearly, the one thing that would give us all a big lift would be some market growth. And that's what all of us are looking for at the moment.","So, the critical point to getting to that $1 billion number is it\u2019s tied back, ultimately testing the market growth and I think we're all looking to see and once we get through these challenging few months now, that that sometime during the course of 2020, we're going to see some real growth back in the market.","Harry Curtis","Just a quick follow-up on that last sentence. Do you think that or do you think there's going to be or how much of a positive impact would you expect from the operation of the light rail and then the beginning of high speed rail expansion down to the Hanshin [ph] stuff?","Jim Murren","I think all of those things are incremental now, Harry. I don't think there's any one \u2013 I've said to a number of people that Macau was starting to become more of a mature market. Yes, we're still well underpenetrated in China and the market is still strong, but the characteristics about the single event having a significant impact, it\u2019s just not there. And it's just a question of applying pressure to all of the levers all of the time, keeping our costs in control and making sure that we just take advantage of all the opportunities that arise.","Harry Curtis","Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will be from John DeCree with Union Gaming. Please go ahead.","John DeCree","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, I wanted to go back to the real estate discussion a little bit since it's most popular today, and potentially a number of strip assets potentially coming on the market for sale, and you've just gone through two processes, potentially another one.","I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the type of demands for Las Vegas Strip assets that you're seeing in bound. I'm sure there was no lack of interest in the Bellagio and just wanted to get your thoughts on the number of interested parties.","And then the follow up would be, Blackstone obviously paying a full multiple for Bellagio but a long term partner if you could talk a little bit about some of the other deciding factors other than valuation that that maybe put you in Blackstone together?","Jim Murren","Sure. The two transactions we announced really had two different objectives but accomplish the same thing in terms of moving toward an asset light strategy. I'll take the smaller one first. Circus Circus as you know was part of the Mandalay Resort Group acquisition way back in 2005.","The property was performing extremely well and then the great recession hit and Circus struggled mightily. And we're immensely proud of the men and women there, many of them are there today that brought that property back to a very high level of performance but Circus was never going to be really strategic to MGM Resorts because it doesn't add a customer segment that we don't already adequately account for.","And so, the focus on that was to find a very good home for Circus Circus. And of course we have high degree of respect for to Mr. Ruffin. We transacted with them before. He lives here in town. He's invested in Las Vegas and he has some really exciting plans for Circus Circus. That was important to us because we were intending and will sell the entire enterprise including the land. And we do believe that the northern Strip has got a great future with the convention expansion, with Resorts World, hopefully the Drew and, of course, ideas that Mr. Ruffin has on Circus.","The Blackstone transaction was very different in the sense that we had never contemplated, we\u2019d never contemplate in selling Bellagio outright. We didn't want to transact with the real estate. And by bringing the Real Estate Committee together and spending the time to really understand, not only what our tax basis was at this property, but what our legal options were and what a lease could look like and how we could minimize the friction costs, while still retaining some key decision rights.","We landed on this joint venture concept which, of course, is innovative, first of its kind, where we will retain a 5% equity ownership in the real estate of Bellagio, selling 95% of it to a subsidiary of Blackstone. Blackstone certainly was not the only counterparty we talked to. The net was pretty wide and it zeroed in to a half a dozen or so extremely well-known, very sophisticated, deep-pocketed real estate owners.","But we concluded that the best course of action was to focus on Blackstone to try to get the most precise execution. I think we\u2019ve done that. We took the time also to create a blueprint for other transactions. And that is having the predicted outcome which is companies like Blackstone and Blackstone themselves continued to be interested in Las Vegas real estate, but really only on quality Las Vegas real estate. And of course we own most of the quality Las Vegas real estate including MGM Grand Las Vegas.","So, one, the blue print we're proud of it, and we think it can be adapted. Secondly, there are a number of counterparties that would be interested. We've done a lot of work already. And by taking our time we've also benefited from increasingly low interest rates which has \u2013 and high access to capital markets which also increases valuation.","So we are not interested at this point in time and acquiring assets. We're not looking to acquire any other \u2013 anyone else's assets. We're looking to monetize the assets that we own either jointly or in whole. And I think that the blueprint is now well established and you're going to see us use that blueprint in a relatively deliberate, prompt fashion on MGM and perhaps other assets.","John DeCree","Thanks, Jim. I think that answers all my questions. Appreciate it.","Operator","Next question will be from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Katz","Hi. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about the MGP stake, my question and follow-up is, is there a path to lowering MGM's stake in that other than MGP going out and buying something and using the capital markets to raise equity?","And then if that were to occur what does \u2013 well, obviously that triggers a number of different things within the MGM model. And I think Felicia was getting at this earlier. Paint us a picture of what that looks like. Should you get below \u2013 I think Corey you said 30% where it would be a deconsolidated entity and what is the balance sheet look like then?","Jim Murren","Well, I'll tackle the first part and kind of \u2013 the second answer is to be determined. I don't think we have enough inputs that we are prepared to share to give you a kind of satisfying answer to that unless Corey has a better answer than what I just gave.","I think the important point to make there is that we will own less of MGP because we see \u2013 what's on the horizon for MGP and the pipeline of transactions that we know they're looking at that could be done productively and accretively for MGP, which would we believe and only would be done if we believe this would be well received by the markets and therefore be able to access the capital markets, so we will reduce our stake. That's, that's a very clear scenario we foresee.","In terms of other ways of reducing our stake in MGP, there are other ways but our focus right now is on what we've talked about, monetization of the real state of MGM, monetization of our other jointly owned real estate, executing on the Blackstone transaction, which who knows could lead to other transactions with that entity or other entities like Blackstone, executing on the Circus Circus transaction, and MGP whether or not they participate in MGM Grand which is entirely possible, in fact more than likely, would therefore be a part of our reduction of our equity ownership of MGP. But I don't think we're prepared to give an end state to what our balance sheet or theirs would look like on a post deconsolidated basis.","Bill Hornbuckle","What I would say obviously is if they're not consolidated with us, there they have the highest rate leverage ratio right now and obviously given our one times US operation and where we are in China, we would expect our balance sheet leverage to go down even further.","Jim Murren","Even with -- sorry, go ahead.","David Katz","Even, I mean I think part of what where Felicia was headed was you would consolidate the MGP debt, but you would then be replacing it in some sense with a lease obligation now that MGP is deconsolidated and all likelihood potentially right.","Jim Murren","Yes, yes. And think about it kind of simply we\u2019ll reduce, we're eliminating near-term maturities, bank debt bonds and replacing it with long-term low cost capital in the form of leases. Just, if we did nothing else but that seems to be a very smart financial strategy given the stage of the economy that we're in right now.","But by reducing our financial leverage and focusing on consolidated leverage and lease adjusted leverage which we've talked about all three, we believe we're strengthening the company's balance sheet and actually redeploying capital in a better return fashion.","David Katz","Got it. Thank you very much I appreciate it.","Jim Murren","Okay. I think that seeing the time is a bit past, I want to just sum up by saying thank you for being on the call. We had a satisfying third quarter. As I said it's in line with our expectations. Our convention business, a key driver of the health of Las Vegas was strong in the third quarter will be strong for us in the fourth quarter and into next year.","We've made great progress on MGM 2020. We're proud of Grant and the team's stronger ramp in Cotai. And we're delivering on our operating targets. We have a positive outlook for the current quarter. We're on track to hit the 2020 targets that we've mentioned for EBITDA, free cash flow per share and leverage.","We're also delivering on our financial targets. We continue make excellent progress on our real estate. We know the positive impact they will have on our balance sheet, our free cash flow per share and our ability to execute on our targeted growth initiatives. And with that I want to thank you for dialing in and as always we'll be around for questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"15001":["MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) Q3 2018 Earnings Call October 30, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Daniel J.

Please note this conference is being recorded.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo. Please go ahead.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, Phil, and good afternoon and welcome everyone to the MGM Resorts International Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at investors.mgmresorts.com and we have furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this afternoon. On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.

You can find the reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is also available on our website. Finally, this presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Jim Murren.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to announce that our third quarter results came in ahead of expectations with solid overall performance, despite of course the year-over-year challenging comparisons that we faced here in Las Vegas. Company continues to generate strong cash flows and we're focused on appropriately allocating the capital as it aligns with our overall strategic objective. In the third quarter, we distributed $64 million in quarterly dividends and we've repurchased $176 million of stock, demonstrating our commitment to returning capital to the shareholder.","We remain focused on bringing our consolidated net leverage down to between three to four times by 2020 as we grow our cash flows including the benefit of all of our new properties and as well as we manage all of our debt level. We're all well aware that the third quarter was challenging in Las Vegas given the strong comparisons in the prior year, which of course benefited from two fights, strong table games volume, high hold and a favorable convention calendar mix.","In the third quarter this year, there were 120,000 fewer large-scale convention attendees citywide. This resulted in of course heavy reliance on leisure channels and the summer months ended up acting more like the traditional summer months that we've seen historically. While our Las Vegas Strip RevPAR was down year-over-year, it was ahead of our guidance and we still achieved our second best third quarter RevPAR on record. By the way, our convention mix in the third quarter was also our third best.","Our regional properties continued the strong growth we've seen over the last three years. We delivered a 5% increase in EBITDA to $207 million. And in fact our Mississippi properties, MGM Detroit and MGM National Harbor, all had record third quarter. Our regional strategy to operate the premier assets in key markets continues to prove successful and we're maximizing the value of these assets.","We're also continuing to strengthen our position internationally. Over in Macau, we experienced revenue growth of 37% to over $600 million. Adjusted property EBITDA increased over 7% to $130 million. MGM Cotai started out slowly, continues to ramp in the third quarter and the property though experienced a pretty low hold, which impacted its adjusted EBITDA by about $16 million in the quarter.","On August 24, we successfully opened MGM Springfield and the property is already off to a good start. We've received great feedback from our guests who have enjoyed the unique environment and our fellow community members who have welcomed the fresh wave of energy and the local opportunity to the town of Springfield and Western Mass. more broadly. While it's still in its early days, we're encouraged that the resort is performing in line with our expectations on both the gaming and non-gaming side.","Here at home in Las Vegas, we're reaching the final stages of the Park MGM transformation. Earlier this month, in fact on October 12, we officially opened the NoMad on the top four floors of the building. MGM and the Sydell Group headed by Andrew Zobler has truly created something special here and it is a unique destination in Las Vegas. Looking ahead in the coming weeks, we'll open up a couple new restaurants and a nightlife concept. We open Eataly at the end of the year and our front entrance, all of which will be done in December.","Looking ahead, the current quarter is shaping up nicely as we're already seeing the benefits from the expected increase of over 800,000 large-scale convention citywide attendees. We expect this improving convention-based business to ease some of the competitive pressures that we've seen in the leisure channel and that we anticipate our Las Vegas Strip RevPAR will be up 1% to 2% and overall revenues will be up slightly. We also expect our Las Vegas margins to be flat to up slightly as well. We're maintaining our full-year guidance of our Las Vegas Strip revenue and EBITDA declines in the low single digits and adjusted profit EBITDA margins of around 29% or 30% excluding Park MGM.","And so if we look ahead to next year in the group business, we're pacing ahead of previous years. And we expect MGM's group room nights be up again and we expect to gain market share, driven by the expansion of MGM Grand's convention space and of course Park MGM. We're also already having success placing groups in shoulder periods, which we believe will allow us to better yield the rest of our portfolio.","And by the way, Las Vegas was recently selected the number one North American destination in 2019 by Carlson Wagonlit Travel, up from number 10 a year ago. The reason cited in that survey is the strength of the U.S. economy and the ability of Las Vegas as a market to provide high-value experiences for the larger meeting planners, specifically in the higher-end corporate segment, which bodes well for us.","And before we turn it over to Q&A, I want to reiterate some of our financial and operational priorities and our strategy to creating shareholder value. Number one, we're going to continue to maximize the performance of our businesses across our entire domestic resorts portfolio. We expect moderate revenue growth through our continuous improvement effort and an ongoing disciplined approach to both top line and cost control that we believe will drive margin improvement and organic profit growth.","Secondly, we're continuing to invest in our business to maintain and grow our competitive advantages. And by ramping up our newly opened properties like MGM Cotai, MGM Springfield, Park MGM, we expect to accelerate cash flow and free cash flow. We're continuing down our path to a more asset-light model. And with respect to MGP, we intend to work on our target of reducing our economic ownership stake to below 50% over the next three years.","We're singularly focused on the goal of generating consolidated adjusted free cash flow of $3.50 per share in 2020. And ensuring a stringent and disciplined approach to capital allocation, this will include being very targeted in growth opportunity. And in Japan in particular, our sports initiatives and our interactive business and in digital, achieving and maintaining a fortified balance sheet and of course returning capital to our shareholders.","And so with that, I'd like to turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. I was going to say good morning, but old habits die hard, good afternoon.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Hi, Joe.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Hi, Joe.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Jim, hearing your comments and going through your earnings release and the slide deck tonight, I see and I hear the language on your capital allocation priorities and they're unchanged from a quarter ago. I just want to make sure that's the case, particularly with regard to maybe opportunistic large-scale M&A? Under what scenario or scenarios would larger scale M&A make sense for MGM, Jim?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. And Dan just told me, I said 800,000 instead of 80,000. So 80,000 is pretty good. 800,000 would be off the rails, so clarification there. So in answer to your question, I would refer everyone back to our deck. I think it's slides like 5, 6, 7. And that would guide I think the thinking that you should have around M&A. Our focus here is to maximize profitability of our businesses and our cash flows.","And we are going to be very prudent now and in the future in how we allocate capital around all of our growth strategies. The board feels this way and management does that it's incumbent upon us to consider any deployment of capital, whether it's new growth opportunities, M&A or otherwise, through the lens of being acutely focused on weighing on whether or not we can return a very high return in excess of our cost of capital. Absent any clear strategic or financial rationale that would be through that lens, we're going to continue to return capital to our shareholders.","In sum, we like the hand that we're dealt right now. We like our assets. We like the condition of our assets. We like the fact that we've moved out of a development phase into a harvesting or free cash phase. We like our management teams here running these properties. We like our opportunity of winning in Japan and doing well interactive and nationally here in sports and that is the focus of the board and the company.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. And then my second question and this is likely for Corey. As it relates to the Las Vegas Strip, I'm looking at next year and I'm guessing your visibility on group and events is stronger in the first half than the second half. So maybe you can answer it, what happened in 2H? Corey, can you share with us group room nights and revs on the book now versus year ago. Jim, you mentioned the pace is up. And then can you talk about the number of events that you have on the book versus what you had a year ago? And then specifically, can you talk about Mandalay Bay's 2019 group room nights position and maybe to get a sense of that recovery, how that compares relative to this time two years ago? Thank you.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Sure. On group room nights for 2019, and I think you're right, Joe, I'm looking at it in first half and second half, but as we look at the entire year and as we look at also what's out there from a citywide perspective, we expect to be up. What we have on the books right now is pacing extremely well and we believe that we'll gain some market share in the group room night area. And in particular, LVCVA, I think, came out and said that they're going to be up 1%, 1.25%. We believe we will do much better than that on what we see on the books. And the comfort there is we have about 80% of what we think is going to be on the books already on the books. And that's probably the highest we've been in the last, ever since we've really started our budgeting process. From an event perspective, it's \u2013 that's also really hard, because we know where hockey's on the books and what other sporting events are on the books and there will be more events there, but that is also looking pretty positive. With regards to Mandalay Bay, Mandalay Bay will be up next year on convention book room nights. It's still not quite where we'd like to see them, but they definitely will have a nice increase compared to this year.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, guys.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","The next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Jim, just wanted to talk about your fourth quarter RevPAR guidance for a second, the up 1% to 2%. I'm just wondering you have a lot kind of going on still because you had calendar issues in October, you still have Park MGM and obviously Mandalay, which is still ramping. So if you adjust for all of that, what would RevPAR guidance have looked like?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well I think what we're focused on are two things. One I would I \u2013 I reread my transcript from last quarter and I think everyone should reread it as well. We have factored everything into this and we feel that this is appropriate guidance to give. There are gives and takes in every quarter and we took all that into account. We like how this is setting up, I will say that, given all the factors that you just mentioned and given what we've seen early days at Park MGM and what we know about the Mandalay month-to-month-to-month calendar in the fourth quarter. But I think we're going to stick with a very specific, but without too much color, RevPAR guidance.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I mean you understand that I was asking kind of what impact those items had on your outlook, right.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. So, Felicia, just to add to Jim's comment, I mean when you look at last year and obviously the events on 1 October impacted a lot of things, but it mostly impacted occupancy. And so when you look at rates, rates were pretty healthy, convention room nights in the fourth quarter last year despite what happened in this city were up 30% plus in the quarter. So \u2013 despite what happened, there's still some positive things that occurred in the fourth quarter and a little bit of what kind of transpired in the third quarter had to shake itself out and has done so here in October. So that's all been, to Jim's point, kind of taken into consideration with respect to the guidance.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And I think that probably gets to my next question, which is asking it in a bit of a different way because if you look at the two-year RevPAR stack in the third quarter, you were up slightly, right, like 30 basis points and then the fourth quarter, it implied too your stack is negative. So I think just looking at the fourth quarter last year, which was bad in terms of RevPAR, I think that deceleration might be surprising to folks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think and I'm going from memory and you're testing because I'm getting old. But in the fourth quarter 2016, we had a few shows in there that actually rotated out and were very profitable shows for us, particularly at the MGM Grand, if I recall. So again, I think we're looking at this on a micro level within our portfolio and taking all these factors into consideration.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. But if we look at it on an absolute basis, I mean given everything that you said, it does not sound like you are seeing kind of slowing trends, it sounds like actually you guys are kind of on the move forward and up and recovering, correct?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yes. And I mean I think we've talked about this three months ago. What we thought we would see in the fourth quarter and what we said three months ago we're seeing.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And the pace in all channels look really good for the fourth quarter.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Hi, good afternoon. Wanted to start with CapEx on the wind-down of your bigger projects. It looks like there's roughly $300 million left to spend in China and about $80 million in Massachusetts. How long do you expect that to wind \u2013 take to wind down?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Typically, Harry, those sometimes take longer, but typically it's about a six to nine-month process. The pieces in Macau, little bit on the close-up on the original construction, but also include the completion of the VIP rooms as well as The Mansion and the President's Club. But I would say that typically it's a six- to nine-month process post the opening assuming everybody's working together.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","All right. And is Grant on the call?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yes.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Grant, are you awake?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Harry, I am. Good morning.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","And good morning to you. Just testing, I was \u2013 I wonder if you could give us your perspective on the growth that you're seeing in the mass versus VIP \u2013 there's clearly concerns that the VIP is slowing. And do you get a sense that it's taking \u2013 that the VIP is taking a breather or do you think that it's more likely that there's some shrinkage in that business and what does that mean and if you would address the mass as well for the kind of ramp of the property over the next six months?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Okay. So on market conditions first. I think it's been pretty consistent from all the people who have come out and we're saying the same thing that yes, it seems like after what has been a relatively good period of growth of junket, they have slowed. I think there is probably some impact from a whole series of conditions, they've been opening a lot of rooms. Clearly market conditions in China are a little more volatile.","Critical point I'll make on the junket though is that there still seems to be a lot of liquidity. And what this seems to be is much more of a controlled pause rather than the effect of running out of liquidity which, as I think you understand, is really critical in that segment. So I think what we're all expecting is a little softness for a little while until we can get \u2013 we stabilize. For us though, we're still pretty confident because we're opening our other rooms and that's going to be a positive for us. Clearly, we'd like more growth in the market because that will help us increase our share and that leads us to the mass. Mass business continues to be more robust and more resilient than the VIP simply because of the nature of the business and obviously it's much for debate. Like always, the mass business is just not one element, there is a series of components. And while the mid to lower mass is still very strong, there is, similar to the VIP, a little bit of a slowdown in the growth in some sectors at the top end. But again, talking specifically on the property and the ramp up, once we get the President's Club done and the Mansion done and all those construction things out of the way, we're very, very positive that that will allow us to build our base and we'll continue to see that.","As you will see in the quarter, Harry, we had a decent sort of luck effect and some of that was actually a result of the ramping up because you tend to get a bit more volatility and that volatility is just part of that process. If you didn't get it, then you probably weren't going to get the business. So in summary, market growth, I think we're all consistent around that high single, early double digit, probably flat for junket going through and obviously it was a better performance than mass. But it's going to be slightly different over the range of mass customers.","For our property, positive signs, traffic improvement for Cotai. But I also just want to lay the point that we're also very focused on driving business into Macau. The cannibalization there has stabilized at about 12%, 13% and so we've got great opportunities to continue to grow and establish that. So we're getting through the difficult phase of the ramp and now we want to see some momentum from that.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","And just as a housekeeping, Mansion and President's Club timing of completion please?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","President's will be before the end of the year, December. And we're working really hard to get some of the Mansion villas available for Chinese New Year. And we have good grounds to think that's going to happen. So that's a big positive for us.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Okay, very good. Thanks, everyone.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Harry.","Operator","The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I was just wondering if we could go back to Las Vegas for a minute. Last quarter, it felt like we were seeing some signs of promotional activity as it sort of acted over the summer and people were, as I think you guys mentioned, forced to kind of react to lighter convention business. As we move into Q4, are you seeing any signs that some of that, I guess, deeply discounted package tour and promotional activity has abated and that that was sort of just kind of a one-off necessary to bridge that weak period or just how would you characterize the promotional environment in Vegas?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Hey Shaun, it's Corey. In general, I think whenever you have the base of convention in FIT, there is less promotional activity. So, there's peaks and valleys almost every quarter. I think obviously the fourth quarter, there will be a lot less of that with the citywides coming in. But in general, it's pretty similar to the way it's always been and probably got a little deeper in the third quarter. It's probably coming back to some normalcy in some periods of the fourth quarter, but there are still periods like right before the holidays where there is softness, just general softness that usually occurs that people are going to get the rooms filled.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. And then just one sort of bigger picture strategic question, Jim, in some of your earlier comments, I think you alluded to large-scale M&A and how that might fit into your strategic framework. I was sort of wondering if you could address maybe some of the more smaller, tactical, regional strategy you've taken on, I mean, as you've basically now got the operations of both Empire City and Hard Rock Rocksino, how do those, broadly speaking, kind of fit into the portfolio and is there appetite to do more tactical things that build out the regional network even if maybe something larger scale didn't fit those guardrails and how are you considering those types of opportunities out there?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Well, I think that MGP is going to be very opportunistic and aggressive and I'm sure James Stewart will speak to that on his call. And I would, just from our perspective at MGM Resorts, we see a lot of interesting M&A activity for the triple-nets in general in the space, which we're rooting on James there. As it relates to MGM Resorts, we viewed the Yonkers and the Ohio opportunities as unique and distinctive and in exception to a rule. We are very optimistic about the future of New York City as a broad-based gaming market in the future and we're incredibly impressed with the operational performance and the free cash flow generation of the Rocksino in Ohio. Those are very few and far between opportunities. I would view them both very opportunistically.","Our market access deal with Boyd really answers the question for us as to whether or not we need to own a physical asset to maximize the opportunity in sports betting and the answer is we do not. We do not need to own or operate physical assets in order to maximize that opportunity. And so M&A, any M&A, whether it's large or small, would have to be scrutinized against those strategic objectives that I talked about earlier and they have a big hill to climb because we really like what we got. As I said, we really like our assets. It's not lost on us that we have the most profitable assets in every regional market, in Mississippi, in Michigan, in New Jersey and of course we're the largest profit generator here in Nevada and of course in Maryland as well.","And so it would be inconsistent with our strategy to look at opportunities that are second tier relative to what we already operate at a premier fashion and it would have to fit the lens of those goals that I mentioned and the free cash flow of $3.50 a share in 2020 and the leverage target that I talked about of three to four times during that same period of time. And all of that would be measured against increasing the dividend in MGM Resorts and buying back stock at what we believe, to be very attractive level.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon. Just to clarify something on the Las Vegas Strip. So, you highlighted that third quarter performance exceeded your expectations. And then you reiterated your full-year guidance. Should we imply that you're more cautious about the fourth quarter or is it you're giving broad based comments? Thanks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Hey Thomas, this is Dan. I don't think there's anything to imply there. I think when you look at the guidance that we had given for the third quarter, obviously a pretty wide range. We've narrowed the range in the fourth quarter to compensate for that as well as the fact that we came in and did a little bit better. We said we are going to be up in the fourth quarter and our guidance reflects that for Q4. And I think other than that, I think we beat this horse pretty well earlier in the call, so I don't think there is anything to read into it other than it all ties together from how we're thinking about and left the guidance vis-\u00e0-vis our prior comments.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. And then just talking about Park MGM, can you talk a little bit about the cadence of the ramp, if there's any changes to that? I saw that you signed up Britney for another residency there. How should we think about the costs and then kind of the revenue ramp there? Thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Are you fishing for tickets there, is that the...","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Exactly.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Got a few things on the ramp, and really, I hope you all get to see this soon. It's really quite remarkable in our view and we've done a lot here. As I mentioned, the NoMad opened on the 12th of this month. The NoMad bar is open. The High Limit area is open. The lobby is open now, and it's been really positively received. All the Park MGM rooms are done and the rest of the NoMad rooms, because we opened up with two floors, will be completed and operational by November 10. The NoMad restaurant, which is a stunner, it's in the old Race & Sports Book, so you can imagine the volume of the space, that opens on the 14th of November. We open up the entire Strip in early December. We open a noodle shop that Corey named La La Noodle on December 12 for some reason.","Roy Choi opens a restaurant called Best Friend, that opens on the 15 of December. Eataly opens on the 27th of December, the nightclub venue opens on the 28th of December, that's the day Lady Gaga starts her extended shows at Park Theater, which you can imagine the response to that, particularly post her great movie. Britney starts in February, Aerosmith in April. We've never had a line-up of performers that we've had ever as it relates to Park MGM.","So, the ramp should be nice going into the Western New Year's period, certainly a hot spot during Knights home games and going into next year, literally everything will be done. And so it's been painful. It's been a long, arduous process, but it's worth the effort. And I think you'll see pretty rapid ramp up of cash flows as all those elements come into place for 2019.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And what I would add is, sort of the first half of 2019, even with those events, I think it will be very positive. We still have some rooms that are coming in under the current trends, but by the second half, we'll start seeing that price to where we will \u2013 closer to where we'd like to be. I would say 2020 is more focusing on even making that mix even more productive and focusing on our margins. And then I think around 2021 is when we should see the full ramp at the property.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I think that's fair, Corey. This is a new property basically and so new brand, new property, it's going to \u2013 we expect it to go through a ramp up like MGM National Harbor did to where it's doing extraordinarily well now and the way MGM Springfield is right now, we expect that to ramp up from an absolute cash flow perspective in a determined fashion. We expect the same kind of focus at Park MGM.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Thomas.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everybody, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. So for starters, Corey, you talked a little bit earlier about the 2019 pace and obviously having the base on the books has been something that obviously over time has shown a nice ability \u2013 you've shown a nice ability to kind of better yield-manage or better price, I should say, some of the leisure rooms. When you think about having that better base for 2019, as well as some of the competitive pressures that you mentioned from peers on the leisure side, is part of the strategy there to maybe keep the group rate a little bit more enticing to get that business on the book so that you are able to flex on the leisure and transient side in 2019?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","The way we've always approached the convention is we really do price to market and there are times in softer periods we'll adjust the rates. Obviously, we'd much rather have a higher convention rate than a lower-end leisure package rate. So, yeah, we do that flexibility quite a bit. Another thing we've learned especially in this third quarter in particular is flexing our database and we think there is still an opportunity there. We know our competitor outmuscles us, especially in Las Vegas and how they fill in particular some of their core rooms. So we think there is an opportunity there also to help once again build that base to yield up to a higher level where we don't necessarily have that dependency on the OTA that we experienced in the third quarter.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then just if I could touch quickly on the 4Q RevPAR guidance as well as kind of the moving parts, you talked a little bit about Strip net revenue being flat to up slightly. Is there anything in there on the gaming side that would kind of \u2013 if you just think about the three components obviously with RevPAR up and you guys obviously surpassed your expectation for this quarter. So, if we assume the 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter, on the gaming side, the comparison is fairly easy. I think you guys last year had fairly normal hold, but obviously saw some of the impacts from the events of 10\/1 on slot handle and some of the other gaming metrics. Is there anything in there that maybe you're being particularly conservative about or were there some one-off events later in the fourth quarter that might have been a little more additive?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Well, I think, Carlo, I think we were relatively in a, I'd say our norm \u2013 our current normal range last year on the casino side in terms of table games hold, although I think it was north of 25% last year. So, we typically forecast the kind of the midpoint and from that standpoint, so there's a little bit on the casino side when you look at where the hold is coming into play there. And then it really comes down to, December comes down to the last week of the month and who shows up, particularly on the casino side, on the high end for Western New Years. And so that's usually where fourth quarters are made or broken is really over that Western New Years kind of last four or five days of a month kind of comes into play. So, we're using the data we have to kind of run that \u2013 run those counts and those forecasts and I think that's kind of where we're landing at on those two fronts.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And then just Dan, since you mentioned just on that fourth or sorry, somebody?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, I was just going to say that I think you have mentioned about the event calendar, there's really no change this year versus last year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","We have two more hockey games on that.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. But I mean in terms of tent-pole events, concerts, fights, et cetera, we're pro forma-ing a pretty similar quarter.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And just around the holidays this year, is there anything with the way that especially December the way New Year's will fall and stuff, it looks like it could be slightly beneficial. Is that the way you guys are interpreting it?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","It could be, just the way the holidays are falling kind of early in Monday, Tuesday kind of combo. So you could see kind of a double weekend effect, so to speak, with the folks coming in Friday, Saturday, leaving on Sunday and a new group coming in for the New Year's. But that's the traffic pattern that we've got to kind of wait and see how that starts to fill in, in November and December.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Carlo.","Operator","The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Hi, afternoon everyone. I wanted to ask two questions. One is that I know you've indicated previously that MGP is the stake that you would sell down over the next three years. I wonder if you could shed some light or provide some color around why three years, why not one, two or five or how did we arrive at that pace?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Maybe I'll tackle then Dan you could go on.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","My expectation is that MGM Resorts' economic interest in MGP will decline. I don't know whether we'll sell any shares. I expect that MGP is going to grow, grow I think as rapidly as it has grown since it's gone public, and grow with other operators. And in doing so, our economic interest will go down. It's a target of ours that we think is a reasonable target. When we articulated last quarter, we have expectations that MGP is going to continue to grow rapidly and in the meantime, we're rooting them on.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Understood. And if I can ask a second question, just I know you've given some data points and some insight around 2019. But given that we've spent \u2013 we've talked quite a bit about guidance and the structure of guidance this year, are there any thoughts that you can share about what the structure of next year's guidance might look like?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, sure, David. This is Dan. I'll take that one. We've been obviously talking to a lot of you all on this call, both from sell side and buy side and we've been working through this quite a bit. So, as we get into 2019, our approach is we're not going to eliminate guidance. We're going to modify it and speak to kind of one quarter out, both in terms of our overall net revenues here in Las Vegas as well as a subset of that being continue to give you one quarter out guidance around RevPAR and EBITDA margins from that standpoint, and help you model out both from the sell side and the buy side each one quarter out from that perspective, we think that's more prudent and more useful to the investment community.","David Katz - Jefferies LLC","Perfect. Thanks very much. Thanks for taking my question.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, David.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. I actually originally had a different question, but then just a follow up on a comment you made in answer to kind of talking about getting \u2013 making sure that you get your fair share or more of group nights next year. Can you give us a little bit of color around if group rate is down slightly and I understand that's probably still a significant percentage higher than those rooms going to the tour and travel distribution? So maybe if you could just kind of talk a little bit about what the sort of the rate \u2013 group rate down still gives you what advantage over the leisure package mix?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I'll answer that, Robin. If group rates are down a little, it's not going to have not much of an impact at all. It's a lower percent of our room mix than any other segment we have. What it allows us to do is yield up the other segments and pick and choose some of the okay segments that we want to focus on and center on. So more importantly than the rate, it's the base that it provides us to be able to drive the additional yield out of our rooms.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah, and Robin, if I can add to that a little bit. Sometimes there's a little more nuance in that as well, it's not just a mix, it's a phase mix within the calendar throughout the year. So sometimes if we can play through in typically shoulder periods, after Labor Day, things like that, after holiday periods, that certainly helps the overall portfolio and helps us to hold the portfolio as a whole.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And on your 2020 goals, maybe if you could just \u2013 you mentioned that you were happy with your assets and things like that, didn't necessarily need to do a large-scale transaction. Does your 2020 goal include potentially though some M&A activity or is that a 2020 goal without any additional M&A, small or large?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Robin, that's just what we've known at the time, which was essentially MGP's acquisition of Rocksino and nothing more than that. We didn't bake in any future deals on the acquisition front into that goal. That's status quo new development projects that obviously come online and MGP's purchase of Rocksino.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And I don't know if you would take one last one, which is actually just switching back to Macau. Just given the concession expiration in 2020 and I guess the language of the contract says that a new concession would have to be in place six months ahead of time, which would be September of next year, so now kind of less than 12 months away. I wonder if you could tell us about how you're thinking about approaching kind of what your approach is over these next 10 months and whether you're expecting to be asked to make a commitment to, a financial commitment to infrastructure build or what types of things you're kind of doing in preparation for these next few months?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Grant, could we give you that one or do you want me to tackle it?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Thank you, or maybe we both do it. And I think Robin, what we've always said is we continue to be in dialogue with the government and we are obviously specifically working through it and we're quietly confident, probably more than that, that we'll be in a position to do that. We obviously do expect that there may be some expectations that we need to work through, but those discussions are still ongoing with government and it's really going to be up to the government to make that final decision. Anything more to add, Jim, on that?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, the only thing I'd add, Grant, is that I don't think the government has any expectations. They're going to go right up into the last moment here. The discussions are ongoing and prompt and timely.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. And just so that free cash flow goal for 2020 includes anything over and above what you would have to do as part of that process. Is that fair to assume?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","In terms of what, in terms of additional capital expenditures or?","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Exactly, like in other words, your free cash flow over and above any additional capital commitments that you'd be making for that process.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","That's right, yeah, no, we would measure it in terms of us achieving that. And looking at whatever investment we would consider, it would have to significantly enhance that. Otherwise it's just, as Jim said earlier, sticking to our strategy and what we have on our plate right now and staying focused on that and returning capital to shareholders if that's the best use of that capital.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And I think what Robin was asking is, are we anticipating whatever it is we might have to do, is it within that free cash flow per share. And we are comfortable with that free cash flow per share target of $3.50 given everything that we know including our hope and expectation and our license is extended in Macau.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Thanks very much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming. Please go ahead.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. We've gotten a few questions over the last couple of weeks from investors about outbound Chinese visitation to the U.S. and any potential impact that we might see on Las Vegas. I think I remember some prior estimates is that that business is kind of a low single-digit composition of your Las Vegas business. So was wondering if you could kind of put some parameters on that and if you had any comments about what you're seeing in your business perhaps from Chinese visitors to your properties in the U.S. or maybe just more broadly, international trends that you're seeing in Las Vegas.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Sure. John, it's Corey. On the high-end side, it's actually the business has been pretty good and pretty strong still. We've seen very little impact at all on the ultra high-end customers and that level play. On the low end or the just the normal consumer, it is a very small percentage and many of them come in tour buses and tour groups and are mainly at the lower rate. So there's been maybe a slight impact, but not enough material to impact our business. It's just not a big enough piece of our business.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Okay. That's fair enough. Thanks, Corey. And I had one separate question, follow-up, perhaps Jim, not sure we got through an hour here without talking about sports betting in much detail. Recent partnership with the NHL, I think there was a new CEO appointed to your JV with GVC and I was wondering if you could spend a minute or two kind of high-level updating us on the progress of the JV at GVC and I guess your thoughts on some of the early days of sports betting we've seen in New Jersey and Mississippi so far?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Yes, I was with Commissioner Bettman yesterday inking the NHL deal which we're very proud of. And that you add to that one the NBA deal we did about three months ago and of course, the JV with GVC. First, we'll maybe start with the JV. Board has met several times. We have hired a terrific CEO that has deep experience came from GVC. The infrastructure has been put into place in terms of the governance. Hiring is underway, office sites are being scouted as we speak. Partnerships for the JV and other forms of technology, sports content, et cetera is underway.","We know we picked the right company in GVC. They are relentless, they're aggressive, they're smart. They feel the way we do about the opportunity in the United States, not only in sports betting, but in the whole interactive platform. They're rooting us on as relates to our league relationships that we're forming. And between the two of us, we've been reaching out in a targeted way to a variety of sports teams, not only within the four major sports, but more broadly globally in other sports as well. As it relates to early days, we're already doing as much business in Borgata as any of our luxury properties do out here from almost a standing start and we're doing equally well in Mississippi. I think our playMGM app is finally now into the Apple Store.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","In New Jersey.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","In New Jersey, which is a big positive development. And we're working literally on a state-by-state basis with the appropriate state agencies to help those states craft the best legislation for the respective states. I can't overemphasize how exciting we think this is going to be over time for the bricks and mortar business of MGM Resorts as we develop global partnerships, global relationships with customers and cross market to our existing resorts. And I could say that the early days are \u2013 given us great confidence of that, both in terms of New Jersey, of course, but here in Las Vegas. And we expect the states to roll out in kind of a predictable fashion over the next few years and we expect to have a very large percentage of the total interactive market here.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And what I would add also is we've heard comments like it's going to ruin Las Vegas business. Our Las Vegas business is up actually tremendously important both in \u2013 we mainly look at the major sport of football pro and college is up over 50%. Our mobile is up over 60%. So I think the whole thing is beginning to take off with the legalization of it.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Very helpful, thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I think the last point I'd make on it that the approach that I have \u2013 I've very much admired the approach the leagues are taking, which is an evolving philosophy as it relates to sports betting here in the United States and the aligned values that we have with the leagues and the teams in terms of the integrity of the product, the importance of data getting the greatest in-game betting experiences, it's going to be a very competitive marketplace. There are a lot of fine companies globally that are already participating in sport spending and interactive in general and we just intend to be the leader in it, that's all.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Thanks, Jim. Appreciate the update.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks for sneaking me in. Two quick questions, I guess, first, as you execute along a path to asset-light, how does your thinking about leverage levels change? And then second, looks like MGM Grand was a bit of an outlier in the quarter with solid growth year-over-year and I think even outperforming Bellagio for really the first time in looks like almost a decade. Were there any specific benefits in the quarter that we should think about as we model that going forward? Thanks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure, Stephen, I'll try to tackle those for you. Corey will probably chime in on the Grand. The Grand had its best third quarter ever and it benefited on the casino side. And that's the great thing about the portfolio we have. They benefit on the casino side, which obviously positively impacted their results to the detriment of some of our other properties that they hold as well. But that's the power of the portfolio. As far as leverage on the asset-light model, we still have our goal of three to four times leverage by 2020. And I don't see us changing from that perspective. Whether it be current state or whether it be more asset-light going forward, it's probably just not a good use of \u2013 I believe not a good use of our capital to be anywhere lower in terms of that leverage.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Correct. And not a good use of my sleeping hours to be any higher. So we like the zone. It's a fortressed balance sheet. We have \u2013 certainly we have a lot of opportunities within our control to become asset-lighter over time and we intend to evaluate all those. But the board and management talks a lot about that leverage zone. It's been a goal of ours since 2009 and we're approaching that and we intend to stay in that zone and return anything to shareholders in excess of our free cash as long as we're staying in that zone. Corey, did you have something on the Grand versus Bellagio?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. It did hold extremely well, yeah.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Maybe \u2013 just had one quick follow-up to John's last question on sports betting. How do you generally evaluate the value of partnering with national leagues versus the individual team?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","They're not mutually exclusive and I think you'll find us being strategic on individual teams as well. It starts, I think, with a shared philosophy which we have and a shared trust and familiarity and a common purpose. We just can't afford to have anything go awry here in sports betting and I think what has attracted the leagues that we've transacted with to MGM is our single-minded focus on the propriety of the product.","And so I think we felt it was important to establish a couple of tent-poles, which we expect to continue to evolve over time. As it relates to individual teams, we're in a vast number of discussions with teams across the country and in fact around the world. And I think it comes down to the same core principles I just mentioned with the leagues, to have a shared vision of what sports betting in the interactive experience could mean to the players of those teams, the teams' values themselves, the fan experience and engagement within the venue, the broader fan engagement outside of the venue. And some teams have a more constructive view on this than others. And I think it's just going to be a matter of going through all that.","The key to all of this and why GVC is so important, but why the league relationships are so important is the technology, the product and the data that we can utilize. And I think that's why we looked at the interactive business in a holistic way. We know we have great brands, but so do our competitors, some of them \u2013 not many, but some of them. We needed to have great technology. We have found that in a great partner. We have very strong government relationships, which are a strength here. We're noted as a company in problem gaming, in responsible gaming and from an integrity perspective, which bodes well in talking to teams and to leagues. And of course we've established a vast advantage in sports by our history of whether it's the MGM Resorts Summer League here with the NBA or the Las Vegas Aces. We're helping house the Vegas Golden Knights, of course, helping bring the soon-to-be Las Vegas Raiders to Las Vegas. It's a matter of making sure that we utilize these in a holistic way and using the leagues and their content to help our properties, which is why we are hosting multiple events at, say, Mandalay Bay, multiple venues here at Bellagio, Aria, et cetera.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. That's all. Super helpful color.","Unknown Speaker","Very last quick question please.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from Cameron McKnight with Credit Suisse.","Cameron McKnight - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks very much. A question for Corey or Jim. What percentage of room nights in the quarter were allocated to your casino block and how does that compare to the ordinary mix of casino room nights?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, it's something we usually don't share, that we were definitely up in that area and we used that as a strategic component. But in general, it's usually bigger than the convention block, but smaller than our FIT block and we think there's opportunities to really move that up a few percent.","Cameron McKnight - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, got it. Thanks. And then a question for Jim, I mean there's been a lot that's been spoken and written about resort fees, paid parking and other initiatives that have been taken over the last couple of years. Are you seeing any pushback from customers on the Strip?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","We, I think one of the data points I just pointed to in that large-scale convention booker is the value proposition that Las Vegas represents. The U.S. economy, as it has grown has made Las Vegas on a relative basis even a more attractive destination from a price perspective. And we monitor this against all of our major competitive cities around the country and in fact around the world. So, it has been something that we always focus on. We don't think it has been an issue. We always evaluate these market conditions. And we look at not only the data we have, but the data that the LVCVA puts out and we know that from an ADR perspective, we're still much lower than cities like Orlando or Chicago or Hawaii, and \u2013 but we continue to tweak it and we always will.","Cameron McKnight - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Perfect. Thanks very much.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you. And I guess I just want to thank everyone for joining. I know we ran a couple of minutes over. But I appreciate your interest today. Obviously, we had a challenging quarter, but did a little bit better than we expected. We're setting up nicely here in the fourth quarter next year. And we are absolutely utterly focused on delivering on our strategic objectives, which we reiterated in the investor deck, including that $3.50 a share of free cash flow in 2020 and without it.

Finally, this presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I'll now turn it over to Jim.","James J. Murren","Well, thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a good fourth quarter and end to the year coming in above our guidance here in Las Vegas. On a consolidated basis, our fourth quarter revenues grew 18% year-over-year and our adjusted EBITDA grew 21% excluding certain one-time benefits.","Here in Las Vegas, our strong fourth quarter was driven by selectively leveraging our casino data base and healthy convention business that improved intra-quarter. We delivered revenue growth of 6% and RevPAR growth of over 8%. We grew EBITDA by 15% or 8% if you exclude one-time benefits despite holding at the low end of our table games range.","Our fourth quarter margins increased 220 basis points during the quarter or by 50 basis points after that same adjustment. This was the best fourth quarter in Las Vegas since 2007. We\u2019ve many of the premier assets across United States and our regional properties performed well in the fourth quarter with revenues up 18% and EBITDA up by 32%.","We set fourth quarter revenue and EBITDA records at MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, Beau Rivage, and Gold Strike Tunica. Over Macau, the overall gaming market grew by 9%. MGM China's revenues grew by 33% and EBITDA was up 11% as we gained market share in the fourth quarter. Grant will be available during the Q&A course to answer any questions that you may have.","Now I want to spend a few minutes on our MGM 2020 plan, which we announced last month. As you know, couple of years ago, when we implemented our profit growth plan, we underwent an organizational transformation that resulted in key centralized business functions to create best practices across our resort portfolio. This platform is established now and running and we can now leverage the centralized functions.","MGM 2020 will be rolled out in phases. We announced Phase 1 on January 3 and with the help of outside consultants, we will implement comprehensive organizational changes as we find more efficient ways to operate. As announced, we expect Phase 1 to realize $200 million in annualized EBITDA uplift by the end of 2020. Half of that will be labor savings, 25% from sourcing and the remaining 25% from revenue optimization.","Phase 2 is centered on the company reallocating a portion of our annual CapEx budget to technology investments. We expect these investments to increase our revenues through a customer centric strategy, driven by data, digital and loyalty capabilities. We expect this will yield an additional $100 million in EBITDA by the end of 2021.","Through MGM 2020, we are investing in our business to drive long-term growth. As we saw with PGP, we expect to see financial benefits building. And in this case into the back half of 2019. Accordingly, we expect to realize a third of the initial $200 million of EBITDA by the end of this year with approximately two-thirds of that coming from our Las Vegas properties.","We spent a lot of time on this. We talked about it last May during our Investor Day. We made it official in January. We have the full internal team focused on this effort. We\u2019ve a strong sense of the numbers. We know how we will achieve those numbers and you will hear more about our progress in the near future.","Turning to this year, we believe we are positioned well here in Las Vegas with better citywide convention expectations as well as our own bookings. We are also excited about the entertainment calendar, bolstered by great programming at Park Theater, featuring of course Lady Gaga who sells out every single night.","Our business fundamentals are solid. However, we will maintain a level of caution as we navigate through broader market volatility, the rising cost environment, trade tensions and the resulting concerns on global growth. That said, we believe, based on what we're seeing today that the consensus for Las Vegas strip EBITDA for the full-year 2019 seems reasonable.","As I mentioned earlier, we're making good progress on MGM 2020. We will incur some costs in the front end before we start to see the financial benefits as I said in the second half of this year. We are excited to have Park MGM and NoMad fully open. We view this property just like a brand-new opening and expect a normal ramp up period over the next couple years.","And as you know, we're making important investments in sports and entertainment that we believe will reap future benefits. Our regional properties are off to a solid start this year. The addition of Empire City in New York and the soon-to-be acquired Northfield Park in Ohio, further cements our leadership in the Northeast and enhances our cross marketing efforts across our entire portfolio.","Macau is number one gaming market in the world, but we all know it can be volatile. Therefore our focus there is on increasing our market share as now all the amenities in Cotai become fully available. We're pleased that our VIP junket areas are open, the Mansion high-end Casino is now operational, and the mansion which is stunning will soon be receiving guests.","And as we look into 2019 and beyond, we are committed to our long-term strategy and our goals remain intact. Our 5-year capital cycle is now complete and we will reap the benefits of these investments in National Harbor, Cotai, Springfield and Park MGM. And today we are reaffirming our consolidated free cash flow per share target of $3.50 in 2020.","Our project MGM 20 gives us increased confidence in our ability to hit those targets even in light of a more uncertain macro environment. We continue to be focused on a fortified balance sheet with targeted consolidated net leverage of 3x to 4x by year-end 2020. Over the past two decades, MGM has developed and assembled our industry's most successful portfolio of premier real estate in the United States. And during that time, we've executed on strategies to highlight this value and have been focused on unlocking long-term value for our shareholders. And this will continue.","Our management team and the recently announced ad hoc committee remain committed to exploring and executing a real estate strategy that is most optimal for MGM Resorts. One that supports our goals of enhancing free cash flow per share, maximizing the value of our own real estate, preserving the company's financial flexibility and creating sustainable shareholder value.","Lastly, while the company is focused on targeted growth opportunities such as sports betting and Japan's IR, we will continue to return any excess cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. In fact, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through buybacks in dividends in 2018. In this afternoon, we just announced another increase to our dividend.","So now let's turn it back over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph Greff","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Jim, it's great to hear you talk about the momentum and not just on the Strip, but also in regionals and Macau. But my first question or questions are more strategic in nature. My first question relates to the ad hoc committee of Board that was established last month. Can you talk in broad terms about what is being evaluated, i.e. is the committee and the Board looking at things? The Board has looked out before and it passed on because of timing of circumstance. Is it a new willingness to transact real estate that you weren't willing to do before. How important are tax considerations today versus these considerations before? And to what extent is MGP Independent front and center in the committee's evaluation. And then related to this what\u2019s the timeline for when you would expect this to make --this committee to present to the Board, its recommendation and when would the Board booked to act upon such recommendations, I know it's a lot here.","James J. Murren","Yes, thanks. So let me -- I will start and we have -- and you\u2019ve followed us a while, we've always thought about what is in the best interest of the shareholders, how can we strategically create value. We\u2019ve been doing that for a long time. The creation of the UPREIT with MGP was borne partly out of that belief that we can create value, create a new security, in the triple net space and of course it's been very successful brought that public at $21 a share, then, and it's like $30. We've said at the time and we remained very committed to the fact, we expect MGP to continue to grow. In fact, we expect it will outgrow its peer group and the triple net broader sector. And it can because it can transact with MGM unlike many others, and it can make third-party transactions done accretively as they have done since they\u2019ve been public. And through that, through the growth of MGP, we expected MGM Resorts that are interest will decline not because we would like to sell op units, but because we expect MGP to grow. The idea of the ad hoc committee was to accelerate input even greater focus on the opportunities that MGM Resorts board believes it has in assembly the kind of real estate that we uniquely own. We among any other company have the real estate throughout the United States that affords us the opportunity to evaluate on a property by property basis, how to maximize value. In the ad hoc committee which has already met a couple times, as already talking to bankers, is going to be focused on that very effort. With management and the ad hoc committee consisting of real estate and shareholder experts are going to be working with management and the full board to deliver their findings. And of course they\u2019re board members, the board members have helped us as management craft our entire strategic goal. And this is very, very exciting, but complicated and we are going to make sure we get it right not for tomorrow, but for the many tomorrows in the future. I\u2019m not going to get ahead of the ad hoc committee and give you a timetable considering it was only formed on 24 January. But I will say they\u2019re focused, they\u2019re expert, they will be professionally advised and that be working with a full board and management and we're excited about the opportunities that it seems to us we have more than any other company in our space. There will be a lot more to speak to this in the coming months and quarters.","Joseph Greff","Thank you for your thoughts. I think my follow-up question was already taken.","James J. Murren","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","And our next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Hi, everyone. So Jim you talked about the probable strength in the group outlook for Las Vegas in 2019. And according to the LVCVA data, it looks like first quarter is strong, second quarter's growth is even stronger. How to use -- how do you compare that to what you see on your books so far by? And if you could give us some color by quarter.","James J. Murren","I will turn that over to Corey on the convention side.","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. I think -- hey, Harry. Throughout the year our convention business is pretty solid. We have a lot of it. Most of its on the books already, but on a cadence by quarter, we' re seeing improvement in every quarter compared to last year. Obviously, the first quarter is going to be our strongest as it always has, but all the other quarters look pretty good for us also.","Harry Curtis","Okay. And Jim, just a follow-up on that. The question in inquiring minds want to know is that do you have any bid for giving some indication of what RevPAR in the first quarter might look like?","James J. Murren","Nice try Harry. Dan, you want to give a view on what we think about in terms of that kind of guidance?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well sir, I will. Thanks, Harry for the question. Clearly we've been, Aaron, Cathy, and myself, the whole team here have been talking to a lot of you all, both on the buy side and the sell side and really as you all know we\u2019ve been seeking that counsel and that guidance and that input for quite some time. There is one real common thread that really came through in most of those conversations, which was really getting to the longer-term vision story and goals that we're trying to achieve and attain here from a company standpoint. So we're going to continue to give you a lot of color. Obviously, Corey just gave you a lot of color around the convention business. We're going to continue to give you a lot of insight into the baseline business and what we're seeing. But getting into kind of quarterly specifics, has not worked out too well for us. So we are going to continue to focus on the long-term, as you will get a chance to go through the deck that we posted, which has a lot of information in it. You will see that we are reaffirming our 2020 $3.50 per share free cash flow guidance as well as some of our EBITDA targets in 2020. Obviously, Jim, commented on the consensus numbers for the year and we feel like it's the investment community a lot of good data points to be aligned with management and what we\u2019re trying to achieve here.","Harry Curtis","Thank you for that. And my second question I wanted to shift to Macau, a real quick question for Grant. Grant you had very strong revenue growth up 33%. EBITDA growth was shy of that. Would that do more to mix, more VIP mix? And as we look ahead, how would you expect that flow through to look as we get into the back half of this year, particularly when the Mansion opens?","Grant R. Bowie","Yes. The margin actually is about where we were expected. But you are correct there was obviously mix effect, particularly with the introduction of the junkets into Cotai. And clearly now that we are stabilizing the Cotai operation that focus we had to put on cost management [indiscernible] and critical to us. So in terms of the go forward, we are in that phase of just locking everything down. In terms of the mansion, clearly we're excited that we are bringing that all on board and getting all of those assets generating. And so as a result of that, we are -- well, I\u2019m very positive in terms of how we are now building that momentum. Also excited that we're starting to see stabilization and business opportunities reemerging in Macau, because as I\u2019ve already -- always indicated we see this as a two property strategy and we want to drive the importance by property. So, yes, we are confident that we can improve margin. We still give the guidance. We look to the mid to upper 20s in terms of margin performance.","Harry Curtis","Okay, Grant. Terrific. Thanks very much, guys.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Harry.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Shaun Kelley","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Just going to the slide deck and some of the longer-term goals that you guys provided, I believe, you did mention that for the Las Vegas trip on the -- on an adjusted property basis, you're now expecting to see 32% to 33% margin in 2020. Could you maybe at a high-level give us what your sort of backdrop or assumptions would be to necessarily attain that? I know a piece of it clearly has to be the 2020 plan where a lot of those savings will come from the Las Vegas operations. But so what you need maybe from a top line perspective to actually achieve that or do you think you can get there in even a fairly kind of low or benign top line environment?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Hey, Shaun, it's Dan here. I will start and if anybody else has anything -- I think when you kind of look at it, obviously MGM 2020 is an important component of that strategy and how we get to those targeted numbers. It gives us definitely a higher level of confidence in getting there, in terms of that margin in EBITDA target. When you look at what we're assuming, we're assuming kind of more or less the market is kind of status quo. That low kind of single-digit top line growth and really kind of honing in on what we can control in terms of margin, continuing to use the tools that we've used in the past. From a cost standpoint as well as the team as you saw in the fourth quarter did a great job in terms of yielding our rates up, filling the buildings with the most profitable customers we can put into the rooms and we\u2019re going to continue to deploy that strategy going forward. And so it's from the top line standpoint were not looking at a Herculean lift, but it's pretty much status quo.","Shaun Kelley","That's perfect and helpful Dan. Thanks. And then my follow-up would just be on the 2020 plan. With the kind of the one-third of the contribution you are expecting to occur this year, is that -- is the total contribution going to be net of the investments in the first half? And then as we move into, I guess 2020, would we expect some of these upfront investments, which I am primarily thinking in my head are consulting type costs, will those burn off at some point, meaning these are things that you have to -- they're not necessarily run rate expenses, just help us understand those two dynamics.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, sure. So the two goals, both Phase 1 and Phase 2 are net of the expenses that we need to kind of get the ball rolling on -- in both of those phases. As we look at it, there obviously will be both operational and capital. As you go through the deck, you will see there's probably in our capital number this year, there's about $75 million of incremental spend for these projects that we are looking at on the technology side. And those will come with a return ascribed to them as well. So it is net, and we will be as transparent as possible in going through this over the upcoming quarters. So you make sure you have all the numbers for your analysis.","James J. Murren","And you are right, it will burn off, as we go throughout the year into next year.","Shaun Kelley","Great. Thanks very much everyone.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thanks, Shaun.","Operator","And our question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Hi. Good afternoon and thanks. So, Jim and Dan, in the past you guys have said, as you were over the past few quarters reflecting upon your guidance conundrum, you\u2019ve said that you guys don\u2019t get -- do such a great job with guiding out past one quarter, the quarter that you're in. So can you just help us understand the confidence in the full-year EBITDA guidance you gave us in your prepared remarks?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, I think, a couple of things. I think one is, I necessarily wouldn't hang my head on that being official guidance. What we are looking at is obviously the current estimates that are out there. And again, they seem reasonable from that perspective in looking at the 2019 period.","James J. Murren","And also, instead of not a good job, we\u2019ve half of the baccarat business in this market. We are bigger than our top two competitors combined. We have over 42,000 hotel rooms, but it is a market that's very dynamic. And so we are trying to give color, but recognizing the fact that this is not a global company in the sense of spreading all of our assets all around the world, we are giving you very specific color as to Las Vegas, and I don't think anyone does a better job than us. I think it's been a dynamic market.","Felicia Hendrix","I'm just using words you guys have used \u2026","James J. Murren","Yes.","Felicia Hendrix","\u2026 in the past. And then I wanted to circle back to the committee to evaluate your real estate portfolio. I know it's really early stages and perhaps just in this release and the way that it's out there, this could evolve over time. But I\u2019m just trying to wrap my arms around the whole process of evaluating your real estate portfolio, because when you think about your real estate portfolio, it's really three wholly-owned assets on the Strip and your JV in CityCenter right, because Springfield is already kind of called for. And so, I'm just trying to -- from my own analytical purposes, trying to see what benefit you might get from selling those assets beyond potentially issuing a special dividend, or maybe holding that cash to use for CapEx for Japan, because your balance sheet -- even without that, will get to your optimal levels. I think everyone would -- based on the guidance that you have for the next few years. So I\u2019m just -- can you help us understand what evaluate your real estate portfolio really means, because you don't really have a lot of real estate left?","James J. Murren","Sure. Well we don\u2019t have a lot of assets left, but we've a tremendous amount of real estate value. I'm sitting in a building that's worth billions right now.","Felicia Hendrix","Oh yes, you have those two, right? And that\u2019s -- that could generate -- exactly, but it's just kind of -- I guess, what I'm really trying to get at is, how could that be strategically benefit -- beneficial for your valuation and the longer-term shareholders, beyond perhaps special dividend or something like that?","James J. Murren","Right. Thank you. I mean that's the question that we are working on here at management and the full board. And the reason why we created this committee, is really to create some real focus on evaluating what our very complex decisions that get into our balance sheet, get into our -- the tax basis of assets, get into our growth forecasts. And because we\u2019ve the talent on our board, specific around real estate and because they've been willing to give their time, I felt as part of management and as part of the board, that it would be beneficial to all of us to accelerate our thinking, and our knowledge accumulation, as to what we should do. But I don't want to -- I want to be very clear on this. The ad hoc committee as part of the board is focused on the same strategic goals as the entire board and management to reduce our leverage, to drive our free cash flow, to create the quantum of cash that we believe we're going to use, because we believe we're going to win in Japan to be able to allocate the cash to the shareholders, while concurring with our leverage targets. And so, you are absolutely right, we only have a few assets that are wholly-owned today by MGM Resorts. We have a joint venture that is very valuable, that we've said, we would like to strategically rationalize in the future. And we\u2019ve the ROFO asset in Springfield. And they\u2019re going to look at all those properties and those ideas with outside advisers and I feel really good about it frankly, because it will allow management to work with a very expert group of people, and our shareholders want to know, and we want to let them know, what is in the best interest of the shareholders from a standpoint of maximizing value. And I thought this will be a great way that identify the seriousness, the focus that the company has on our unmatched portfolio, both in terms of what we own outright, and what we own through MGP, and how it is that we look at those two entities and our joint ventures to maximize value. And that's really why we setup the committee. And as I said, they've already met, they've even been bankers. They're very focused, and I've been really happy with the output so far.","Felicia Hendrix","Thank you. That\u2019s super helpful. And Grant, just quickly, any early comments on Chinese New Year?","Grant R. Bowie","Well for us, the most pleasing is the Chinese New Year. This year is actually our second. We had our anniversary, so we are through our first year. It was solid for us. Lot of traffic in the city. It looks like the bridge has driven a lot of traffic. Probably hasn't -- as we see across [indiscernible] converted into gaming revenue. But we are also seeing indications that the play is extending longer. So we are well into the 10th day now and play -- and particularly in the upper end of the market that is pretty positive. So I would expect that, definitely for us, it has been a good holiday period continuing on from the fourth quarter for us, but from the city, I think it's probably solid. Lots of traffic, but I\u2019m not expecting that there's significant spikes in GGR. I would just reiterate comments I've made in the past. I think we are now starting to find that from a gaming play, when we get into these big holiday seasons, we are -- clearly we are getting a lot of footfall and a lot of traffic into the city. It's not necessarily -- it's probably more likely to be leisure visitors, as opposed to strictly, say, more gaming leisure.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay. Thank you.","James J. Murren","And maybe I should bring up Chinese New Year's over here in Las Vegas, anticipating the question. I think we highlighted this, didn't we, in the deck? We had a very high hold percentage last year. And we are not holding to that level right now, number one. And secondly, there are a few players that just did not come to the United States, partly due to the government shutdown, some other logistical issues. We lost some groups to places like Sydney and London. So we can thank our total government for that, but we have still a good play in town. And as I said earlier -- as of last year at least, we're 49% of the entire baccarat business in Las Vegas. And so, I feel like we have a good feel for what's going on here, but I would say for -- at this point in time, we're going to be below what we earned last year for Chinese New Year, as a result of the whole delta and fewer customers in town.","Felicia Hendrix","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli","Hey everybody, good afternoon. If I could -- and may be Corey is best with this. With respect to the mix for 2019; I know last year or I should say 2018, you guys made a concerted effort to kind of expand your casino occupied room nights. As you think about 2019 and acknowledging, it sounds like your in-house and obviously citywide group is going to be a little bit better, so I would expect that to increase a little bit. Is the objective to continue to grow what I think is like a mid-to higher teens casino base at present?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. I think -- look we constantly look at the market and look at what our competition is doing. I think there's opportunities to grow that base, from a customer gross profit per room night, they\u2019re definitely higher than some of our other segments. In particular, our focus is not just on the convention, but also improving the transient side of it, and as you mentioned the casino side. The one challenge we are having now that we see in the market is on the leisure side, and especially on the land only. And we're seeing customers potentially going to Europe and other areas. But I think by increasing our casino database, it will help us offset some of loss in those areas. But in general, we think there's still opportunities to move this a few percent, and be much more profitable as a company.","Carlo Santarelli","Great. And Corey, just to kind of follow-up on what you said. One of your competitors earlier this earnings season referred to Las Vegas as a marketers market, and I\u2019m assuming that that\u2019s kind of dovetails with what you just noted on, on the leisure business. Are you guys seeing any kind of heightened promotional activity in Las Vegas around that leisure business?","Corey I. Sanders","Look, I don't think it's any different than what it has been. When you don\u2019t have a base of convention or other events happening in town, that segment has always been very competitive. I don\u2019t see much of a difference in the offers going out there. They are always pretty rich, and the amount of I\u2019m seeing actually they seem a little lower this year, than what was happening in the third quarter.","Carlo Santarelli","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys.","Corey I. Sanders","Thanks, Carlo.","Operator","And our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Hi. So there's a lot of focus from investors on your Strip margins, and seeing progress there. Considering that your margin is up every quarter in 2019, does that make sense or based on your previous comments, should they more hockey-stick in the second half '19 and into 2020? Thanks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Hey, Tom, it's Dan. I think, obviously, factoring the comments we made around Chinese New Year's and hold, we did hold pretty high in the first few quarters last year, more towards the high-end of that range, so that always impacts. And when we do our modeling, we are using kind of midpoint of our range kind of numbers. So that\u2019s going to impact a part of that margin. But you're correct in that, as MGM 2020 begins to ramp up in the back half of the year, that\u2019s going to help the margins in terms of a third and fourth quarter from that perspective, as well as some of the burning off of some of the expenses of the upfront cost for the initiatives.","James J. Murren","And the ramp up of Park MGM and our convention business.","Thomas Allen","Helpful. And then just on the topic of ramping, can you talk about -- give any incremental color on how you see Springfield performing today, and how do you think that probably is going to ramp, and the other properties that are ramping right now? Thank you.","James J. Murren","Sure. Do you want to go with that? We both know. I was just there. Oh gosh, it's a beautiful property and great. Unbelievable feedback we get from customers, from the gaming commission in Massachusetts, from the elected officials and our food and beverage operations are ahead of target. Our hotel business is ahead of target. Our gaming business is slower, but ramping. We actually saw the almost exact same thing at National Harbor, as we built into a brand new market for us. So we expect that, given the quality of the assets and the people working there and the word-of-mouth marketing, we are going to be a little bit more tactical in marketing and reminding people that we are there, particularly, leading up to a competitor in Everett, that's opening up in the second half of this year. But we view its operating future very much the same as what we\u2019ve seen in a different scale, with a smaller investment up there than at National Harbor, but what we are seeing in our other new properties.","Thomas Allen","Helpful. Thank you.","James J. Murren","Thanks.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","And our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling","Hey, I guess first a follow-up on the real estate and ad hoc committee. You mentioned reducing leverage in the response to another question as a first kind of priority, and thinking about monetizing real estate. How would you think about the appropriate leverage ratio for an asset light OpCo relative to one with underlying real estate?","James J. Murren","I think that\u2019s going to be part of what the committee does. As we evaluate the asset intensity of MGM Resorts and understanding the fact that MGP is a triple net and MGM Resorts is and always will be responsible for the capital that we continue to invest into those properties, which has been very successful. We are going to make sure that MGM Resorts' balance sheet meets the objectives that we\u2019ve laid out and is as durable as possible. And I think we've made this very clear before, we are not going to be in a situation we found ourselves back in '08 on the eve of a global recession. We are going to be more conservatively postured. We are increasingly aware of what\u2019s going on around the world. Global trade tensions, slowdown, RevPAR declines and reductions of RevPAR guidance at hotel companies. And so, we are going to take all that on board with an eye toward making sure that we have that [indiscernible] balance sheet that we are delivering on the beacon, that is $3.50 of free cash flow in 2020, and anything that we do with our real estate portfolio or what we own of MGP, will have to fit very squarely within those strategies.","Stephen Grambling","That\u2019s clear. And maybe changing directions a little bit, we are seeing more news drilling out of Japan on the integrated resort side. Can you just provide whatever color you can on how you are thinking about the opportunity, including the next key milestones and any evolution on your expectations?","James J. Murren","Sure, I will. We\u2019ve had -- so a lot of progress in Japan. We\u2019ve been there, as you know longer than anyone else. The government is literally still traveling around the world, learning best practices in terms of how to implement a proper RFP process, as well as the regulatory framework. We have a large team there in both Tokyo and Osaka. We just recently opened up a office in Osaka. We\u2019ve committed now to the Mayor and to the Governor of Osaka, that MGM has adopted in Osaka first strategy, we are focusing our considerable resources on Osaka. The government itself has said that they likely come out with rules and policies this year, July August of '19. Osaka as a prefecture, we believe its RFP will come out soon thereafter. And we think at this point in time, our guess is that an operator will be selected by Osaka by early 2020. The next step for Osaka or any other jurisdiction is to go to the central government. We know we think Osaka will be one of the three concessions that will likely be granted, but we know the central government has to select Osaka and its operator. That probably happens maybe 12, 18 months after Osaka itself picks its operator. And remember that Osaka's goal is to have an IR opened by 2025, that's when the World Expo is in Osaka. So we\u2019ve been very active. That's why you don't hear Bill Hornbuckle on this call, because he is in Japan right now. And we are focusing our energies there. We have been developing consortium partners, exciting programming, getting ready for RFP submission. We have no illusions to the fact, that it will not be competitive, it will be highly competitive. But I think the cards are stacked in the favor of those who are prepared, who have been working hard, who will have the best program, best strategy, the best understanding of the country, of the prefecture, and I like a lot, MGM's chances.","Stephen Grambling","That\u2019s great. One last quick one, if I could. Just can you give us any sense for how forward trends are unfolding at Park MGM as we get past the renovations? And has anything changed in your expectations for how this property returns will ultimately shake out? Thanks.","James J. Murren","Yes, I mean we had a -- it was a busy fourth quarter at Park MGM. Multiple, multiple elements opened up throughout the quarter, both in terms of the food and beverage venues, in terms of the nightclub, in terms of the residency for Lady Gaga, all that is right on track. And we've been building in the early days, of course, only couple -- month and a half into it, right on track from what we've talked about in terms of our return on investment goals. We are highly confident we are going to achieve them. The property is completed now. Eataly has been opened and is doing extraordinary revenue on a daily basis. The other restaurants are very successful. The shows are selling out every single show. The ADR is moving up quite rapidly, both at Park MGM and at NoMad. We are still transitioning the customers from the old Monte Carlo customer to a Park MGM and a NoMad customer. So that is the ramp component of it, but our GEM scores or customer scores are through roof, in terms of the attractiveness of the property and Corey do you have anything to add?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. The other thing, getting that front door has been a big plus and we are seeing the casino numbers we were hoping to see at this stage in the game. As Jim mentioned, the food and beverage numbers are where we expected, as are the hotel numbers. Just transitioning that customer, which we think will take some time, but the acceptance of the property has been amazing and all you have to do is walk through there on any event night and just see what potential for that property is.","James J. Murren","Here is an amazing thing. I don't know if we've talked about this. But before we built the Park, before we built the plaza in T-Mobile, the traffic counts on the east side of the Strip were profoundly higher than they were on the west side of the Strip. Now it's completely the opposite to the point that the county is building a bridge, so that people stop trying to run across from the east side to the west side. I don't know when that bridge is going to be done, but it's underway right now. That's really the last element. It's not in our control, that's a county project. But to give you a sense of the traffic flow is now on the west side of the Strip, as a result of T-Mobile, the Park, the improvements to New York and obviously the improvements to Park MGM.","Grant R. Bowie","The Bridge is supposed to be done around summer.","James J. Murren","Summer?","Grant R. Bowie","Yes.","James J. Murren","The Bridge this summer.","Stephen Grambling","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Best of luck this year.","James J. Murren","Thank you.","Corey I. Sanders","Thank you, Stephen.","Operator","And our question comes from John Decree with Union Gaming. Please go ahead.","John DeCree","Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me, Jim. Wanted to get your thoughts on sports betting industry. You\u2019ve been very deliberate and quick in choosing your partners' sports league, your technology partner and GVC, and seems like we had a little bit of a roadblock with the latest opinion from the DoJ, that seems aimed at inhibiting the industry. I was wondering if you had an initial view on the path forward? And I guess more specifically, has it changed MGM's thinking at all in the near-term or is it still full throttle on the interactive and sports betting side for your company?","James J. Murren","Yes first on the second part, the latest missive from the DOJ is perplexing is an understatement. And if read as words, it would mean that Powerball as it exists in 44 states in the United States, isn't legal anymore. And so it's just -- we think an absurdly, poorly written and unenforceable opinion. And I don't think anyone in the industry, the gaming industry, the sports betting industry, feels any differently. As it relates to our strategy, we have -- we are really excited. We are proud of what we've done. I think we've talked about this before, but we felt the pillars of success would be the following. We wanted to make sure that we had the right technology, in-house, scalable, evolving technology and we knew we didn't have it and we didn't want to buy it off the shelf and we did not want to buy a company, and that led us to the robust negotiations and the conclusion of joint venture with GVC, and that is working out extremely well, certainly from an MGM perspective, but I think GVC would say the same. We have a leader there. They are scaling up their operations. They are sourcing the headquarters. They are building staff. So we feel that, that was the right decision, not only from a technology perspective, but to get the in-game betting analytics, which are really vital to real success. That\u2019s one. Secondly, we wanted to develop an extraordinarily robust trusted relationship with customers, which is why -- before we did almost anything else, we started reaching out to targeted number of the leagues. Those league partnerships which we\u2019ve announced, have resulted in manifest opportunities for us. The NBA, as an example, because of that partnership, you are going to see a far more exciting, longer lived summer league activity out here this year, what I think tremendous more attendance, viewership, interest, as one example. The MLB partnership, in addition to working with MLB and their advanced analytics, through their dotcom channels, has also resulted in some exciting Japan opportunities for us, as MGM is hosting a number of the roadshow events that MLB is doing in Japan, leading up to some games that teams like the A's and the Mariners are playing against themselves and against Japanese teams. The NHL, with their puck and play, and of course with our proud ownership of -- at least as a town of the Golden Knights, has led to other relationships outside of that. So these league relationships at the bigger league level, and even at a -- right now a micro level, with the alliance of American Football, which just launched last weekend has resulted in interesting technology play, which is how we view that involvement with AAF. That\u2019s working out I think extremely well, but early days. The rollout state-by-state is as expected frustratingly slow, tortured, unclear, not transparent. Some states we believe have done it well, some states have done it very poorly. And there is a mix everywhere in between, and there are several major market states right now, that are exploring that right now. Our sports betting app is doing well. Our sports books, young as they are, and in some cases only temporary, as in the case of Mississippi are at\/or above what we thought they would do. So I think I would call this very competitive. Some really smart companies in this space competing against us. They too have made progress. The Ceasar's transaction with Turner, I think is a clever and smart one. I think you will find our company going down other paths or may be similar paths, but everyone has a view this as a good opportunity. But I think I'd have to say, from our perspective at MGM, we view sports betting as a larger opportunity than simply betting on sports. We look at it as a total interactive experience, which is why you will see us talking more about social games, digital ventures, and a big part of bringing in an outside consultant that we talked about in our digital strategies around 2020, that second phase that we\u2019ve talked about is going to be in -- not only the interactive space, but around sports.","John DeCree","That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks for all that color, Jim. I appreciate that. And just one smaller tailed question on sports, if I could. You gave a little commentary about Chinese New Year. I think we are pretty close to overlapping with Super Bowl. But wondering if you had some comments on how your properties felt during that event this year?","James J. Murren","Yes, that\u2019s a good -- thanks for bringing that up. I should have brought that up. We had a good Super Bowl at MGM Resorts. We could add -- we could have made more money with different outcomes, but I guess it shows the power of having a lot of liquidity and a lot of handle on the game and we did better this year than we did last year on the game itself, profitability on the game. The challenge for us this year for everybody is, the Super Bowl on Chinese New Year is almost right on top of each other, as opposed to last year, where they were almost two weeks apart like a week and a half apart. So we had challenges around high-end room product. We had challenges around activity and then exacerbating that in the case of Chinese New Year, is a fact that some folks just didn't feel like coming to the United States, because of any number of reasons, but it was a good Super Bowl, and we made more money than we did last year.","John DeCree","Thanks, Jim. I appreciate the questions and color, and congratulations again on the fourth quarter.","James J. Murren","Thank you.","Unidentified Company Representative","And Cole, can we please have the last question?","Operator","Sure thing. And that will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Great. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered or at least asked. So just a couple of quick ones. One is, where did convention mix end up coming in for 2018? And I know you made some general comments about 2019, but I don't if you have a [indiscernible] convention mix will be? And then, also had a question on -- last year at your Analyst Day, you talked about kind of some future potential capital projects, one of which was kind of reorienting the MGM Grand property, kind of opening it out to the Strip a little bit more. Just wondering if you have any time frame around that or are capital projects like that kind of on hold, while the -- your Board committee looks at different options for real estate? Thanks.","Corey I. Sanders","So -- hi, Robin. It's Corey. On convention, we -- for '18, we ended up a little under 18%, and for this year, we expect to be above that amount. On the project at MGM, those projects usually take a long time to get them right and figure out. So we think there's an opportunity there with the West Wing, planning it, getting the right product, the right mix in, seeing what\u2019s happening at Park MGM, also seeing some of the other investment income. We think it gives us time to really figure out what to put in there that could be successful. And so, we keep planning and when we\u2019ve more news to announce, we will get it to you.","James J. Murren","And I guess I would add too Robin, that our overall annualized CapEx number hasn't changed. Anything that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of potential projects are in that number. There aren't any incremental additional capital spends that will come. In the case of the Grand, it's illustrative of the levers that we have to pull. We don\u2019t have to do anything. We can evaluate -- sometimes, we evaluate for quarters and years, and do nothing, because the market moved away, or we\u2019ve different capital ideas. We are not very close as to what we are going to do there at this point in time. What we did say, which I think we should focus on over the next couple of quarters is, capital that we will spend within that limit that we\u2019ve set for ourselves, will be allocated more than it has in the past to technology, and the combination of the capital and the OpEx around our digital ventures area in 2020, will be taken in priority, and if we do that properly, and we think the money is there, our outside consultants think it's absolutely there. It's like opening up a new property, without all the attendant responsibilities and future capital needs that a new property represents. So we see more opportunity on the capital side, now that we are very happy with our portfolio, given our leading position here in Las Vegas, given the fact that we are now done with those major projects that add more engines for free cash flow, to really evaluate everything through the lens of ROI, but also through the lens of do we spend capital on technology that can drive business in a much higher-margin way, and the answer is yes.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","James J. Murren","Thanks, Robin.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to the MGM management for any closing remarks.","Well, thank you. First I want to -- on behalf of the whole team here, thank you for joining us today. Obviously, we had a clear beat in the fourth quarter. But a strong finish to a challenging year, but a year that was not without a lot of rewarding achievements. We opened Cotai, we opened Springfield, we opened Park MGM, lot of our regionals hit profit records. We talked about PGP today, because it provides the framework to think about 2020, laid the foundation for it, and that centralized expertise is going to -- we are confident, allow us to achieve these profit targets that we\u2019ve talked about. And the investments we talked about today in sports and technology, we are also confident it's going to achieve really exciting long-term growth for the company. The whole interactive space is going to be large and we expect to be dominant. Our development cycle is over. Our new resorts give us more free cash flow engines and we're going to use that free cash flow and harvest it, to hit the net leverage targets and return it to the shareholders. And most importantly, that free cash flow target that we set out quite a while ago, that $3.50 a share in 2020 is the beacon that drives all of our tactics here at the company. And that\u2019s the goal we absolutely intend to achieve. And in the meantime, as I said, I don't think there's any company in the world better positioned to win in Japan, and we intend to do that. And with that, thank you very much for joining us and we will always be around for your questions.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings Limited; Chris Nordling, Chief Financial Officer of CityCenter. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, thank you, Mackenzie, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and a replay of the call will be made available on our website later today.","This morning, we furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC and before we get started, we'll just read some Safe Harbor disclosure statement. On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance.

And with that, I'll now turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. First, on behalf of MGM, we want to express our best wishes and concern for everyone that's been affected on the phone here and our other friends on the East Coast for this very devastating storm, Sandy. Our hearts and thoughts are out to all of you.","Today, we reported our third quarter operating results. The results in Las Vegas were consistent with the commentary outlook that we gave on our last earnings call. Remember, we had guided for REVPAR to be down slightly, and it was down a little less than 2%. MGM Grand Las Vegas had its best quarter in 2 years, and the Mirage had its best quarter in 3 years. Bellagio, obviously, held poorly and as a result, had a down quarter. MGM China had a record third quarter with EBITDA growth of 5% year-over-year before branding fees, and CityCenter continues to show progress as well with record third quarter EBITDA from resort operations up 18% year-over-year.","Now, the third quarter did present tough comparisons in Las Vegas. However, we do continue to see indications of a recovery here. To give you a sense of the cadence of the quarter, August was particularly rugged, but then we saw improving trends in September, particularly in the back half, and that has carried into October, most importantly. We're managing our costs where we can and FTEs are down about 2% during the quarter.","Meanwhile, we're completing many meaningful projects at our properties and are working on a handful of key strategic development and expansion opportunities, including Cotai, which we'll get into; Maryland, Massachusetts and Toronto.","In Cotai, we have formally signed the land concession contract and have closed on a $2 billion credit facility, which, along with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, will give us the financial flexibility to expand in that region, strategically invest in our current resort and continue to maximize shareholder value.","In Maryland, we continue our efforts to support the passage of Question 7. We feel strongly that the expansion of gaming in that state to include table games with a sixth site will bring a number of much-needed jobs, millions of dollars for education and serve to keep Maryland competitive in that region.","We're also pursuing a project in Springfield, Massachusetts, where we have been very excited about the positive response and enthusiasm we have received there. Our vision in Springfield is to connect Main Street with the vital amenities that already exist in and around the downtown area. MGM Springfield will reinvigorate the city with new retail, dining and entertainment opportunities and spark, we hope, the comeback of this once prosperous New England city.","In Toronto, the provincial government has proposed that the city consider hosting a casino in Toronto. As one of the preeminent cities in North America, Toronto represents an exciting opportunity for MGM with a great deal of international visitation. The city has established a process for evaluation, which is underway, and we fully expect to participate in that.","And finally, our customer loyalty program, M life, continues to grow rapidly and show progress. Over 1\/2 of our database has opted so far to become an M life member, taking membership above the 30 million customer mark. Regional market shares continue to grow with trip frequencies up in all regions indicating increased engagement there.","We're expanding our strategic partnerships in order to add value for our M life customers, as well as growing our M life customer database. Just yesterday, in fact, we announced a partnership with Royal Caribbean Cruises. That's something we're quite excited about and we believe will be a great benefit to our customers and our database. And of course, our partnership with Ameristar continues to drive new membership and increased bookings. We're very pleased with our relationship with them.","On our social game, myVegas, which, as you know, we launched this summer, we already have over 350,000 monthly average users. And many of these customers have actually redeemed their virtual points for actual goods and services at our Las Vegas properties, showing the true conversion from social gaming to our Las Vegas resorts. I think that is the trend which will continue to our great benefit.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about, specifically, our operating results and how we're doing financially.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thank you, Jim. First, I'll cover a few specific details regarding the quarter. Excluding the impact of a noncash impairment charge and accrued Harmon demolition cost at CityCenter, our adjusted property level EBITDA this quarter was $473 million. Our table games hold percentage increased by about 1 percentage point year-over-year, which fluctuated significantly at several of our properties. In fact, as you see in the tables, Bellagio was negatively impacted by low hold percentage. It was actually about 13% in the quarter, which is abnormally low for a property like Bellagio. That was offset by slightly higher than normal hold at some of our other luxury strip properties.","While we were able to maintain our rate at our properties, we did experience a decrease in occupancy, which we had talked about on our last call. The slowdown in the year, for the year convention bookings, we experienced in the second quarter, combined with a difficult comparison, led to a decrease in convention mix of about 2 percentage points year-over-year in the third quarter. This was mostly reflected at Mandalay Bay given their large convention business in -- at that property.","While our occupancy remained high at over 90%, our food, beverage, retail and entertainment were affected by the fact that we had over 100,000 less occupied room nights this year versus last year. These segments were also impacted by certain of the remodels and transitions, several of our buildings and we expect that to turn as we bring these new amenities online in the upcoming quarters.","Our corporate expense for the quarter was up by approximately $19 million versus last year. $17 million of that increase is related to the ongoing development efforts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Toronto. The election in Maryland is next week, so we do expect our corporate expense to be higher here in the fourth quarter, driven by the referendum expenses we're incurring. And that will be up in the fourth quarter in a range in kind of the mid $60 million level for corporate expense before our stock comp expense.","In September, we issued about $1 billion in unsecured notes at a rate of 6.75%, a level the company hasn't achieved since 2006. Following this transaction, we currently have about $855 million in available capacity under our revolver and approximately $900 million in excess cash, totaling over $1.75 billion in liquidity, excluding MGM China. We will continue to evaluate the opportunities to derisk the company going forward and further improve our cost of capital.","As we previously reported, thanks to the support of our relationships and our banks in and around the world, we're pleased to announce that this week, we closed on our MGM China credit facility. The facility was increased from $950 million to $2 billion, with a new 5-year maturity, and is a combination of term loan and revolver. The credit facility rate will initially be HIBOR plus 250 basis points for the first 6 months, and then will range from 175 to 250 over HIBOR determined by MGM China's leverage.","Our third quarter CapEx was approximately up $101 million in the quarter, including about $30 million at MGM China. We continue to expect our CapEx for the year to be approximately $350 million to $360 million for this year in the U.S., about $80 million at MGM Macau, plus another $80 million related to the development of our Cotai project, which includes the $56 million that we recently paid regarding our land concession contract.","To help you with your guidance on some below the line numbers in the fourth quarter, we expect our stock compensation in the fourth quarter to be approximately $10 million to $11 million. Depreciation expense in the fourth quarter is estimated to be about $230 million to $235 million. Our interest expense in the third quarter was $276 million, including about $6 million from MGM China and about $17 million in noncash amortization. And we estimate that our gross interest expense in the fourth quarter will be approximately $285 million.","With that, I'll turn it over to Chris Nordling to talk about CityCenter.","Christopher W. Nordling","Thanks, Dan, and good morning. CityCenter resort operations posted record third quarter EBITDA of $59 million, an 18% year-over-year increase. At ARIA, third quarter EBITDA was $47 million, a 17% increase over 2011. This was also the highest third quarter EBITDA since opening. Total casino revenue exceeded last year with net table games revenue up 4% and net slot revenue up 3%. ARIA benefited from a favorable table games hold impact of $8 million year-over-year, with gross table games hold percentage of 29.3 versus 25.5 last year. We also continue to focus on driving profitability in the casino.","The hotel posted its highest third quarter occupancy, up almost 2 percentage points year-over-year. This was mainly driven by growth in the convention segment. ARIA also recently expanded its restaurant offerings with the openings of Tetsu Teppan Grill inside BarMasa in September; and Javier's, a Mexican restaurant of Southern California in early October. So far, the feedback from our guests have been overwhelmingly positive. In fact, revenues in the quarter for BarMasa with Tetsu were up 44% over last year as customers have been drawn to this unique culinary experience. Additionally, Javier's has had strong launch and has enhanced the energy throughout the adjacent casino floor.","Viva ELVIS officially ended its run on August 31, and we're looking forward to the opening of Zarkana in November. The theater has been modified for the new show, and the artists are completing their final rehearsals in anticipation of the opening November 9. We expect this new show will turn what was a loss to our business into significant profits while also driving up ancillary business.","Vdara reported third quarter EBITDA of $4.3 million, and Crystals EBITDA for the quarter was $8 million. At Crystals, we executed leases for approximately 8,500 square feet of luxury brands during the quarter. That concludes my report, and I'll turn it over to Grant Bowie.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, and for those of us in Asia, good evening. I'd also like to reinforce Jim's comments for our friends on the East Coast of United States. We send you our best wishes, and as a part of the world that suffers from a lot of those natural disasters, we understand completely what you're going through, and we certainly wish you a speedy and happy return to successes that you certainly deserve.","Here at MGM China, the third quarter, MGM China's net revenues were $665 million. That's up 7% year-over-year and in line with market performance. Before branding fees, adjusted property EBITDA was $158 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year. While our overall VIP win rate for the quarter was approximately 3%, EBITDA was negatively impacted by the low win rate on our in-house business and the rolling chip operators.","At the end of September, we completed our VIP gaming expansion project on level 2 and opened the business just before the Golden Week holiday. During the holiday period, our VIP business generated several record single-day volumes with the addition of this space.","During the quarter, across our key revenue segments, we grew our main floor table games and slots while our VIP business was down. Consistent with the market growth, our main floor table wins was up 27% year-over-year. But the main floor business experienced a 300 basis point improvement in departmental margin due to improving table yields and operating decisions based on our key performance indicators.","Now the KPI management process, which was established over the past year, continues to enhance our LIBOR productivity and asset utilization. Our slot win increased 44% year-on-year, exceeding the market growth of 11%. Our slot business had an impressive 50% margin and also up 50 basis points year-on-year and continues the very strong growth performance we're seeing from our slot business.","As Jim mentioned, we have ended our formal acceptance of a land concession contract on Cotai, which resulted in a payment of US$56 million in October for that contract. The next step is for the public gazetting of the land followed by the general building permit approvals. In the meantime, we continue to make progress on getting our construction team in place, as well as refining and enhancing our design. Our general contractor will be on board this quarter as we had planned, and we are prepared to kick off the construction once we receive all the required approvals.","Our Cotai project, as previously advised, will have up to 500 tables, 2,500 slots, 1,600 rooms and a budget of approximately $2.5 billion to be spent over a timeframe of 30 to 36 months. The project will feature over 85% gross floor area of non-gaming office, including restaurants, retail and entertainment.","At the end of the quarter, MGM China had approximate cash of $936 million, debt of $539 million and an adjusted leverage ratio of less than 1 based on a trailing 12-month EBITDA.","With that, I'd like to turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Grant. You know, Grant and his team in Macau are doing a phenomenal job. We're very proud of that effort. We're very excited about the Cotai opportunity, and as Grant mentioned, we hope to break ground in the very near future. It's a great story for both MGM China and MGM Resorts. We believe Macau remains an extremely vibrant marketplace, and we expect the infrastructure additions that are coming over the following years will continue to drive visitation in that market for MGM Macau and our Cotai resort for many years to come.","As I mentioned earlier, we did have a rough August out here in Las Vegas. I think everyone did. But we began to rebound in the second half of the quarter into September and certainly in the second half of that month. And going into the fourth quarter, those improved trends have continued.","Looking at the fourth quarter, we have some good things coming up. Great product offerings are coming online. As Chris mentioned, Zarkana, the new Cirque show at ARIA, opens next Friday. Blue Man Group is coming back to our family, opening up at Monte Carlo the following week. We now have all of our rooms back at the MGM Grand. They're all online as that remodel program was completed in late September. We're still in the progress of remodeling the Bellagio spa tower, which will be completed in mid December, and we'll have more rooms in service in the fourth quarter. And despite having more rooms available, we are seeing a somewhat better rate environment, and we expect that REVPAR in the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly up for the year. Of course, we are watching closely the impact of storm Sandy on these numbers, but we are optimistic with that forecast for the year -- for the quarter.","Looking out into 2013, we're very encouraged to see that convention bookings, our pace is up over 10% year-over-year, with rate up. And although it's early, 2014 pace is even stronger. We're currently pacing to have about 15% more arena events between the Mandalay Events Center and the MGM Grand Garden Arena next year versus this year, and we believe that the new restaurant, nightclub and entertainment offerings that we have underway will continue to not only enhance the customer experience, but drive increased profitability throughout our strip properties.","And so with that, operator, we have -- well, we did a good job. We have even more time for questions, and we'd like to turn it over to you for the Q&A section of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hey, Grant, if you could kind of walk through, obviously, when you look at the Macau segment, margins were down a little bit. Clearly, you had some tough hold comparisons, not so much this quarter but earlier this year and in the last year. Could you talk a little bit around the 3% hold maybe and try and give us a better sense of whether it was unlucky in certain segments that kind of hampered the margins a bit in this quarter so that we can get a better understanding of the normal OpEx we could be thinking about going forward?","Grant R. Bowie","Sure. Thanks, Carlo. Yes, as I indicated and as you've picked up, our VIP market -- or our VIP revenue is generated from 2 components, one being the revenue share operators and the other being from the rolling chip operators. The rev share operators were pretty consistent and are generating about 87% of our business. We did have a difficult and volatile run with our rolling operators. The impact of that on a normalized basis is sort of mid teens of the millions effect, and that was obviously caused -- another effect, which you also picked up, that it did have some impacts on the margins so about mid teens of millions of effect in terms of below normalized win. And then on top of that, you also know with the rolling chip program, we also have the double jeopardy that you don't hold so well but you also end up paying the commissions as well.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. Jim and Dan, if you think about the project that you guys are currently evaluating right now, and obviously some of which are further along the line than others, have you thought a lot about partners at this point or go it alone and if so, financing requirements, et cetera, in the event more than one were to come to fruition?","James Joseph Murren","Do you want me to take that, Dan, and jump in? So we feel like we're going to have a lot of information over the balance of this year and into next year to be able to answer that question more clearly. We certainly open to partners and believe that we should be building projects in the most capital-efficient way and never lose sight of the fact that our overarching goal is to reduce leverage in the company to increase our balance sheet strength. So we got to win a few of these things to see. So we'll know next week about Maryland. If we prevail there in the referendum, we still have to win an RP there. And if we prevail there, we could talk about how that capital structure would be. And the same would be true in the Commonwealth. And then certainly in the case of Toronto, I think we've already indicated that we would want to seek a partner, and that's a very big opportunity. And we've already had very productive conversations as it relates to capital partners if we were to prevail in Toronto. So overarching goal, deleverage this company, but where we have a particular edge from a development perspective, where we believe we can win in markets that are good potentially very profitable, we should seek them in a very targeted way. We're doing that in those 3 markets I just mentioned, and we will ensure that if we do win, we will finance it in a way that benefits the MGM shareholder and debt holders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Lerner with Union Gaming Group.","William J. Lerner - Union Gaming Group, LLC","Just one question as it relates to VIP in general, both in Vegas and in Macau. Maybe could you give a little bit of color on, I guess, trends? In Vegas, obviously, July and August were particularly strong in Bacc demand and win. Have you been -- are you capturing at least on the demand side, and then obviously hold is a different story, but in Macau, Grant, obviously where people see the data monthly and feels like there's a wait and see with respect to leadership change, but any color around what's going on with trends through the -- into the fourth quarter would be very helpful.","James Joseph Murren","Well, Bill, maybe we'll have Bill Hornbuckle tackle Las Vegas, and then you can turn over to Grant. Bill?","William Joseph Hornbuckle","Sure. Thanks, Jim. A tale of 2 stories. Internationally, as you could tell, we were down about 12% in win. If you focus on Jim's earlier comments about Bellagio, it literally got down to 7 customers domestically. The opposite side of it buoyed by some pretty strong events. Domestic, we were up about 18%. We have seen a rebound in late September, Madonna, et cetera, and then pushed off in October. It seems very productive for us, and we're very excited by that. Overall, I think if you look at the marketplace and we've seen what's happened in the community, China is up slightly, as is domestic for Las Vegas obviously. Southeast Asia is doing very well. Japan is still off, and Latin America is up a bit as well. We would like a better share; that's not lost on us. We've done a couple of structural things here to refocus our troops in our group. We've had -- we brought in some leadership both on the international side and the domestic side, and we're going to have a heavy push to strategically reposition troops in Asia to begin to make sure that we get more than our fair share of that business coming from anywhere there, Macau, Singapore and other markets back here to Las Vegas. Maybe, Grant, if you could fill in the Macau story.","Grant R. Bowie","Sure. Thanks, Bill. I think the issue currently is we've gone through a period of exceptional growth. And putting aside the point that you've previously indicated, Bill, the leadership change, and that definitely has an impact, and it has tended to cool the markets somewhat. I think what we're also seeing is that the VIP business is probably consolidating, but I would want to continue to reinforce that the mass market continues to grow steadily and consistently despite seeing our own numbers, and that's showing up as well. And I think that may be representative of the changing nature of the capacity that we have in the market. The VIP business into October has been steady. We saw it going and this is now the, I guess, the third major holiday period where we're seeing the situation where the holiday days themselves were not nearly as strong as the period that followed the holidays. And so that's a trend that we saw last national day holiday, last Golden Week, Chinese New Year now for this period. So I think what we're now seeing is that Macau is slightly changing its pattern. So in summary, the mass market continues to grow strongly. We're confident there. VIP market is consistent, but it's certainly slowed up and what we're looking at is probably numbers of growth going forward, consistent with the GDP growth of China rather than some of these accelerated growth rates that we've seen over the last 2 or 3 years. In simple fact, we're now seeing the effect of large numbers on that.","William J. Lerner - Union Gaming Group, LLC","On the VIP side, right, not mass?","Grant R. Bowie","Particularly the VIP, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I just wanted to go back to kind of the core Vegas trends that you guys were seeing. Jim, if we recall to last quarter, I think you had mentioned that one of the areas of softness was kind of in the quarter for the quarter group business and in group pickup. Could you just give us a sense of, is that what you're seeing improve here in September and October? Or is it more a function of mix? And then my second question would just be kind of how do you think about that group pickup going into next year?","James Joseph Murren","Okay, yes, that's exactly what we did see when we chatted at the end of last call. Corey or Bill, do you want to pick up on that?","Corey I. Sanders","Sure. On the convention pickup, September, October we were in pretty good shape anyways going into the quarter. What we're seeing is on the group booking business is strong and even in the third quarter was strong for the next year and '14 and '15. So that's pretty stable, and that continues to be a positive sign towards our recovery.","James Joseph Murren","Bill, do you want to add?","William Joseph Hornbuckle","Maybe just a little more color. The recovery in casino and FIT, we had seen about a 5-week blip, if you will, June, July. We've seen some recovery since then and the convention story is as Corey has suggested.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Weissman with ISI Group.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk about the continued disconnect between visitation trends in Vegas and spend per visitor. Is it more on the gaming side or on the leisure side?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Ian, this is Dan. I think what you're seeing is, really, you still have a fragile consumer out there and they're continuing to kind of pick their spots. So overall, we're seeing improvement in our underlying trends as it relates to what we take a look at and track day in and day out, which is our revenue per occupied room. There are some days where consumers are picking their spots, where entertainment revenues will look better and the next day, casino revenues will look better. So you are still dealing with a fragile consumer. We are seeing -- particularly in the third quarter, we saw more reliance on leisure customers, which is a lower spend overall type of customer that we needed to dip into a little heavier than we did last third quarter, and that is a lower-spending customer. Going forward, we think we'll see an increase in international travelers going forward. It's not only a push we're making as a company, it's a push the LVCVA and McCarran are making as well in conjunction with us, and we think that will help forward trends as we bring in those types of customers who stay longer, spend more. They're good gaming customers, but they're even better retail, S&B and entertainment customers. So the underlying trends are still moving in the right direction. We had some tough comps in the third quarter as it relates to some of that convention mix and having to dip into the leisure but overall, the trends are moving in the right direction.","James Joseph Murren","I guess I was -- I'm a little confused on the question because I don't see a disconnect. I mean, visitation's up and our revenue per occupied room has been moving up this year and in all areas. So we're looking at our non-gaming as far as gaming. If you take hold aside, the revenue per occupied room has been improving. And one of the things that -- I think what one of your analysts have done, Corey, is to do the linkage between the Case-Shiller Index and our core property volumes, particularly our slot handle. It's an incredible R2 between like 0.97 or something like that. It's pretty tight, right?","Corey I. Sanders","Very tight.","James Joseph Murren","And so as the overall consumer is improving, or housing in general has improved, we're starting to see our core business taking hold out. I'm looking at handling and drops improved. So I think there's a good linkage between visitation moving slightly higher and our overall revenue per occupied room.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess the question was more just generally across the strip numbers. If you look at visitation trends and spend per visitor, just it seems like it's flat lined for the last couple of years, but your comments are helpful. Last question is I know you talk about healthy trends in September and I believe in October. Have you seen or witnessed any cancellations related to Sandy at this point?","James Joseph Murren","Yes. I don't know if you have that.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, we have...","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you want to quantify that?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Sure. We think there's -- we're going to lose about 4,000 room nights. It's approximately about close to $1 million of revenue, a little less than that.","James Joseph Murren","4,000 room nights is -- in the context of how many room nights, Corey, what\u2019s that? Pretty small.","Corey I. Sanders","Yes, it's a very small amount. The cancellation was right in the middle of one of our bigger conventions, SEMA, and that's probably why you're seeing a bigger impact than normal on the revenue side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a follow-up question for Grant Bowie. You commented about the kind of mid teens effect on rolling chip, and is there anything else impacting the expenses in Macau that we should be thinking about going forward?","Grant R. Bowie","No, not really. In fact, we've been, as we have discussed before, been pretty conscious of the need to keep everything very tight, and I'm pretty comfortable with that. I guess just the general overriding market pressures that everybody's aware of labor and the potential for increases in labor costs going forward. So that would probably be the only significant issue as far as I see it. And that's a market impact as opposed to, say, an MGM impact.","James Joseph Murren","Grant, just remind everyone, what\u2019s labor, about 5% of overall costs, something like that?","Grant R. Bowie","Yes, 5.4%.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, so while increasing, it's relatively de minimis.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then just looking at the trends in the market overall, the divergence between your mass continuing to grow nicely and VIPs slowing, do you have thoughts about kind of rebalancing your tables between mass\/VIP or adjusting your focus there?","Grant R. Bowie","We actually do that all the time. With the latest addition upstairs, it looks like there's a slight -- there's been some extra tables going to VIP, but this is a constant and quite fluid situation. And clearly, as we see the demand for the tables in different areas, we would do that. We're still pretty confident that we've got the right balance. We're trying to drive the yields up on the mass market, and we continue to do that and it looks pretty strong. But that's really, it's really a day-to-day active management process that we go through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dan, you talked at the beginning about how hold impacted some of the properties in the quarter. Just wondering was there a net impact from hold overall to your strip EBITDA?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","There was, Felicia. I think when you look at it, obviously, we were up year-over-year in terms of absolute hold percentage by a point. But with Bellagio being so much lower and having most of the volume in our wholly owned properties here at Bellagio, that obviously did impact the overall quarter. It was offset by some of the other properties. I think net-net, you're probably looking at it in a range of about plus or minus around $10 million.","James Joseph Murren","I think the hold was in our normal range, and 1% or 2% is a normal fluctuation that you're going to see in a quarter so it's within normal playing ranges.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. But given the volumes at Bellagio, I guess, Dan, did I hear correctly about $10 million to EBITDA?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Roughly. That's probably about right.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then Jim, just getting back to your group business, last call, you'd mentioned to us that your 2013 group business was largely sold already, but you were mainly at the time working on the holds or the shouldered periods. Just wondering if you can give us an update if there's been any progress there.","James Joseph Murren","Do you want me to turn it over to -- there has been a little bit \u2013 want me to turn it over to one of you guys? Go ahead, Bill.","William Joseph Hornbuckle","I mean, generally speaking, there has. I mean, we go into the year at 80% for the year in the year. By the time, we hit the end of the year, we're already over 80% in those bookings. The only reason you sense a little hesitation in my voice is the balance of that 20% usually comes within the year, 15% give or take. And then the ability to grab rate in those groups in those segments always generally depends on the overview of the general economy, what's going on with FIT. Because while very meaningful to the bottom line, recognize they\u2019re still only about 15% of our overall mix. And so we feel great about '13. We feel better about '14, and our ability to push rate versus hold rate will be determined ultimately by what happens in the first and second quarter with overall visitation.","Corey I. Sanders","And Felicia, we have 91% of our rooms on the books now. So it has improved since the last time we talked compared to about a little over 80% last -- at the same time last year for the same period.","James Joseph Murren","And then certain properties, Chris, I've got to believe ARIA's like sold-out just about...","Corey I. Sanders","We're 5,500 room nights ahead of last year at the same time. We're getting real close there, just small tiny shoulder dates.","James Joseph Murren","Right. So I mean and the ones, the big, our most successful conference facilities like ARIA and Bellagio and the MGM Grand conference facilities, what Bill was referring to mostly is the convention center at Mandalay, which obviously we hold out some for those shoulder periods to try to drive rate. But we're in better shape today than we were when we talked to you on the second quarter call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Bain with Sterne Agee & Leach.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First one's for Dan. I think you have about $3 billion in notes with the combined yield near 11%, and I'm wondering if you can give us any sense as to what that yield could be reduced to and any timing of freeing up some free cash flow from that.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, obviously, you can see where they trade, David, better than we can at the moment and in the marketplace, and there's a big disconnect in what we pay versus where they trade in the marketplace. So there is an opportunity there at the right time to think about putting our capital structure in the right context. And we think we can pick up anywhere from $100 million to $200 million of interest savings in the future with putting the right debt structure in place.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Grant, would you care to take a swing at the opening timeline in Cotai? And looking at where you are related to your competitors, I mean, Wynn has a ground permit, but I don't think they have a construction permit yet; SGM no formal Gazette; Galaxy and Studio are underway. Any way to handicap you versus competitor timelines, and do you think that there are going to be any labor issues in terms of the bottleneck?","Grant R. Bowie","Well, I think we're all running on a reasonably consistent cycle. So yes, it makes it rather complex. It think the key issue is going to be, as you alluded to, it's going to come down to that organization that can line up its approvals most effectively and get out and contract the capacity that's going to need to be available. Now I think that the thing that the government is fully aware of is that they do know all the projects that are coming online; they do know and have a fair indicator because we've all provided information on labor requirements. And I'm pretty confident that as long as we, as an organization, have completed all of the approval processes that we need to go through, that we will be able to secure the contract as who can supply the labor to get the job done. And so it is going to come down to getting ahead on your planning. And we're very confident on that, and we'll continue to do that. And my last comment would be is this is a marathon, and we all just have to keep on working. But it's very, very exciting. We've all worked very, very hard in getting us to this stage, and I think we're pretty confident that we can continue \u2013 and we can keep continuing to deliver, and we keep trying to underpromise and overdeliver.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just final one, Grant, have you heard anything new you on the smoking ban as it relates to enforcement? Any new chatter or do you have any thoughts about that for next year in general?","Grant R. Bowie","That is always a challenge. I think we've seen this around the world. The Executive Order was issued yesterday. We're going through that at the moment, digesting the final details. We've been working on this for some months now, and we have a series of different initiatives. And we're in that process. We do have to submit to the government our plan of the smoking areas, and we need to work through that. So I'm not really in a position to go into too much more detail at this point in time. We are, obviously, looking closely at ways to make sure that we maximize the areas that we do have available to ensure that we can protect our gaming revenues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Oh with CLSA.","Jon T. Oh - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","My question is on maybe if you could help us map out the Cotai CapEx. I believe Grant mentioned $3.5 billion earlier. Could you help us map out what you think is the CapEx crunch over the next 36 months or so, and how should we then think about dividends coming up from Macau with respect to that CapEx we consume? What should we expect? And also we've seen dividend commitments coming from your other competitors that are being quite aggressive out of Macau. How should we think about that, given that you're going to be spending a large sum of money in Cotai?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Grant, maybe I'll start off and you can fill in the blanks. But Jon, the construction spend in Cotai is estimated at $2.5 billion, not $3.5 billion. So -- and the way we kind of look at it is we've just put in a $2 billion credit facility. There's plenty of excess cash sitting on the balance sheet. And depending on how you're modeling free cash flow going forward for the operations over the next few years, there's plenty of sources to not only fund the $2.5 billion Cotai project but to consider and have the board of MGM China think about dividends and other uses of capital going forward to maximize the return to our shareholders. So I don't think those are mutually exclusive, given the capital structure we put in place. From a timing standpoint, clearly, the biggest payment will be the land concession payment that we've made. Over the next few months, we'll be incurring design and preliminary construction and land payments, but really, in these construction projects, you won't start really ramping up \u2018til year 2 and year 3 and a little tail post opening in terms of big dollars of construction amounts. So the first year will be predominantly kind of a land concession payment and some of the preconstruction activities, and then year 2 and 3 is when you'll see the bulk of the payments being made. Grant, I don't know if you had anything more to add to that.","Grant R. Bowie","No, that's pretty thorough, unless we have some specifics.","Jon T. Oh - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","All right. And just finally for me, does this notion going on that post the China election that perhaps we should see some form of resurgence in demand, especially coming from VIP? And this is something that's commonly shared by several of the other companies in Macau also. Maybe for Grant, could you maybe just map us out what do you think about this? Are you seeing any form of stabilization, so to speak, post Golden Week already? Do you think that confidence will come back, and how does that impact VIP and also mass market for 2013?","Grant R. Bowie","As I mentioned earlier, frankly, I don't really see significant impacts in the mass market at all, and we're continuing to see strength in that market. But there is no doubt that the VIP market has slowed and that probably is a little more impacted by conditions in China. I think it's very difficult for any of us to give an accurate assessment as to what -- how long it may take for things to ramp up. I think there's a great expectation and for anybody who's in that part of the world already, there's a lot of speculation. I think the key issue with the VIP there, I just keep on reminding some people, this has been substantial and significant growth over a relatively long period of time, and I think what we're seeing is something of a consolidation. So I don't think some of the indicators we're seeing are entirely linked to just the conditions in China. But we're now working from a very, very big base, and we now are obviously moving forward from that, and that's why we've -- we're looking at moderating the growth rates around that 8% to 10% while the mass market, we would expect to grow -- continue to grow somewhat faster than that.","Operator","Speakers, there are no further questions at this time.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Mackenzie, and thanks, everyone, for joining, given the complications for most of you on the East Coast.

Joining the call from the company today are: Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings, Limited. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Sarah Rogers.","Sarah Rogers","Good morning, and welcome to MGM Resorts International's Third Quarter Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at mgmresorts.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website. We furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website.","Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","Now I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, MGM grew its revenues by 1% and its adjusted EBITDA by 2%. The reason for this is that we had very robust mass market growth at MGM China and an increase in its EBITDA of 12%. That was offset by lower margins here on the Strip due to investments we've made, particularly at the Delano, which we'll talk about doing well. Lower tables hold, we made some customers very happy in the quarter, and the increases in some expenses, which we'll get into.","This was a very important and productive quarter for MGM Resorts as we invested in this framework, the people strategy, to grow our business and to prepare the company to execute not only here in Las Vegas but on the new resorts that we are building.","We are encouraged by the outlook of our business, and we're making many key investments and have many initiatives underway. We believe that will drive future growth and profitability, not the least of which, of course, is at MGM China where our business continues to show strong margin and operational performance despite a challenging marketplace.","We are, of course, very proud of our team's ability to adapt in that dynamic market, and we continue to believe in the long-term future of Macau. Grant will speak to that in a moment.","We're making excellent progress on the development of MGM Cotai. That remains on budget and is on schedule to open in the fall of 2016.","We continue to move rapidly up the tower and have completed 3 stories also below grade now compared with 3 above grade.","We made also a significant progress within The Mansion structure. The Mansion itself, the 27-villa Mansion, we believe, will redefine the ultrahigh-end experience for our guests there in Macau just as it did here in Las Vegas when it opened up in 2000. The Mansion design has progressed. It draws from Portuguese and Moroccan influences, and it is going to be spectacular.","We're applying that same level of effort and expertise to our showroom, which we can talk about now. It's focused on adapting to and transforming the entertainment landscape in Macau. I think this will be an unprecedented opportunity to extend our industry-leading entertainment expertise, creating a versatile stage and venue capable of evolving with MGM Cotai as its destination entertainment options grow and mature. It's going to be one of the many unique entertainment experiences that MGM Cotai will offer when it opens.","In Las Vegas, we continue to make important investments where we see opportunity. The remodeling of The Hotel to the Delano is truly a transformation at Mandalay Bay. That was completed at the end of September. That launch has been very successful and has garnered outstanding publicity and interest. Delano has already exceeded our expectation, driving rates up significantly versus The Hotel, bringing in luxury convention customers for the first time. And we're already seeing positive signs from our casino clientele as well at that resort.","The Strip frontage in Monte Carlo and New York-New York has been an exhaustive and somewhat painful process as we have ripped up the entire front of both of those resorts. And now it's really coming together as that broader strategy on the west side of the Strip.","You'll like this a lot. Later this year when Shake Shack and Tom's Urban opens up in December, and that really will conclude the disruption that we've had at Monte Carlo, at New York-New York and really become, we believe, a magnet for pedestrian traffic.","We, along with our partners, AEG, secured the $200 million bank facility to fund the development and construction of our new 20,000-feet arena. This partnership from the beginning was committed to be privately funded, and we are very proud we accomplished this goal.","The construction is progressing on site and our -- both of our entertainment teams have been seeking out in developing new and expanded events that will help fill this venue, as well as our other arenas. The construction has been very rapid and very exciting. If you've been out here lately, you could see that.","In New Jersey, MGM was unanimously approved by the Casino Control Commission for our casino license in that state. And we welcome the opportunity to once again be an active member in the New Jersey marketplace through our 50% ownership of Borgata. Borgata, of course, is the best-in-class resort there, and we look forward to working with our partner, Boyd, on its continued success.","On the regional development front, the construction of MGM National Harbor in Maryland is progressing and remains on track for a fall 2016 opening. We expect that MGM National Harbor will be one of the most successful U.S. resorts outside of Las Vegas.","And in Massachusetts, there'll be a vote next week, which will determine whether MGM will have the opportunity to develop a resort and casino in Springfield. While we're not going to take anything for granted, we believe and are confident that the public will continue to support the jobs and investment that is really already underway in that state, and they will vote no on Proposition 3 (sic) [Question 3].","Collectively, these 3 properties will make a significant impact on us and create a presence for MGM Resorts on the East Coast. And we see opportunities to cross-market amongst these regional quarter properties, as well as bringing those folks back and forth to Las Vegas.","And in Japan, the debate on an integrated resort remains active. MGM has been very involved and will continue to look at all markets and have a full team deployed there with offices in both Tokyo and Osaka. I believe MGM is as well positioned in Japan as any company. And with a globally recognized brand name in our business, a market share leader here in the convention and events business and the award-winning builder of sustainable projects, we believe our positioning there is very high.","We have also proven our ability to grow in multiple jurisdictions around the world and to be a successful partner with key local stakeholders. And I think that also will serve us well in Japan should this move forward.","And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about our operating results and our financial position. Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, we achieved top line growth, with our Strip revenues up 3% despite a lower year-over-year hold on our table games business.","On The Hotel side, our REVPAR growth of 6% exceeded our guidance of 5%. And this was our eighth consecutive quarter of REVPAR growth.","We were able to grow our convention mix by 3 percentage points during the period. And looking at the fourth quarter, we expect to increase convention mix by about 2 percentage points, which will bring our full year convention mix to an all-time record of approximately 17%.","Based on these current trends, we expect fourth quarter REVPAR to be approximately up 5%.","In Las Vegas, our EBITDA for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $40 million relating to lower table games hold, largely nonrecurring employee benefit expenses and, to a lesser extent, cost and near-term revenue impacts associated with the launch of the Delano and the new Strip-facing food and beverage venues at Monte Carlo.","CityCenter's third quarter EBITDA from resort operations increased 2%, $64 million, driven by improved profitability at the Vdara, Crystals and Mandarin.","ARIA'S EBITDA decreased 3% due to the decrease in table games hold percentage. REVPAR at ARIA increased by 10% and the resort also reported its second best quarterly occupancy of 94%.","Vdara's third quarter EBITDA increased 30% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a record occupancy of 96% and a 12% increase in REVPAR.","Crystals reported EBITDA of $11 million, up 8% compared to the prior year quarter, another successful quarter for Crystals.","Moving over to the balance sheet. Our consolidated MGM Resorts cash balance at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, of which approximately $540 million was at MGM China. We currently have approximately $1.2 billion in available liquidity under our corporate revolver, while MGM China had approximately $1.4 billion in availability at the end of the quarter.","CityCenter cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $404 million, which included about $157 million of restricted cash. Total debt at CityCenter at the end of the quarter was roughly $1.5 billion.","During the quarter, we spent approximately $103 million in CapEx related to our wholly owned domestic operations and an additional $46 million related to National Harbor and our Springfield efforts.","MGM China spent $98 million, of which $17 million was spent at MGM Macau and $81 million was related to our MGM Cotai development.","That concludes my report. I'll turn it over to Grant for his.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Dan. And also, good morning and good evening. A nice quarter. MGM China net revenues was $794 million. This was a decrease of 2% year-over-year due to the decrease in our VIP games revenue. However, EBITDA increased by 14% year-over-year to $226 million before our branding fee of $12 million.","Very pleasingly, EBITDA margin increased by 330 basis points year-over-year to 26.9%. Our increased profit was driven primarily by our main floor table games. MGM China's main floor table games win increased by 34% year-over-year. This is a significant over performance versus the market growth of 16%. Our continued strength in this segment is driven by the appeal of the MGM brand, our property and our quality services.","Margins on our main floor business remains high as we continue to execute on our strategy. VIP win turnover decreased by 19% year-over-year. It's consistent with the market trend.","Our overall hold was 2.7% compared with 2.8% last year. Slot handle increased by 5%, but our slot revenues decreased by 7% year-over-year due to low hold. We continue to improve and drive better overall yield on our table games productivity through enhanced analytics. As of the quarter-end, we have over half of tables allocated to the main floor, which drive approximately 75% of our profit.","Through our yield efforts, we will continue to maximize our table profitability while allocating tables to the higher-margin main floor.","MGM Cotai construction is moving along at full steam, as Jim mentioned. And the project is on budget and scheduled to open in the fall of 2016.","We believe that MGM China has the greatest potential for growth in the market with our second property in Cotai. MGM Cotai will nearly quadruple our room base and triple our gross floor area, which will allow us to expand our reach into retail and entertainment. These all will create opportunities for earnings and margin improvement.","And with that, I'd like to turn back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Grant. And really, well done in the quarter.","Back here in Las Vegas, we are really encouraged by the trends that we're seeing. And as you know, October consumer confidence was at a 7-year high. That's very important for us here in Las Vegas. People, in general, are feeling better with not only job security, the low interest rate environment, declining gas prices, and we're seeing that reflected in visitation and convention business.","From a broad market perspective, we believe Las Vegas is extremely well positioned. It's hard to believe now after being in 2009 and '10, but year-to-date, our visitation is up 4% for Las Vegas and this pace will mean that we're approaching 41 million visitors by year-end. That, of course, would be a new record for Las Vegas.","McCarran's airport passengers are growing and, importantly, the international passengers are up 12% year-over-year.","The convention business is strong and building, and we at MGM continue to invest where we see opportunity. We're really excited about next year as well when we welcome Rock in Rio, which will debut in May of next year and the 300,000 square feet of expansion space that we're building at the Mandalay Convention Center, which also will open up next year toward the end of the year. And of course, immediately following that, in the following years, the new arena and the others' improvements.","Beyond Las Vegas, we are very excited about what we're building. MGM Cotai, obviously, as Grant said, will have a profound impact on MGM China's footprint, and MGM National Harbor will have a profound impact on our company. And both of those are set to open around the fall of '16.","And with that, since we have plenty of time, I'd like to turn it over to the operator to move to the Q&A section of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Joseph Greff from JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A question for you Dan or Jim. Looking back at the 3Q and the Las Vegas result and the $40 million impact you highlighted related to a number of different things. Can you delve a little bit deeper into the employees' benefit expense and why is that nonrecurring? The Delano, obviously, that opened up in September. I'm presuming that expense and revenue impact has gone away. And the Monte Carlo impact, is that gone away as well? Or is that something that is less now than it was last quarter and then, ultimately, it gets better until that opens of next year? In total, I guess, what we're trying to figure out is that $40 million, how much of that is largely, really, onetime and kind of goes away? And then I have a follow-up for Grant.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Sure, Joe. This is Dan. So when you look at the $40 million, you exclude the impact on hold, really, we're looking at that remaining piece. It makes up about -- 70% of that remaining piece relates to some of the changes in accruals on the employee benefit side and the other 30% really relates to the impacts from Delano and Monte Carlo. And you're correct in that, obviously, Delano is behind us now and ramping up nicely, as Jim pointed out. And as is Monte Carlo, it's continued to kind of gain more and more traction as those amenities and offerings continue to kind of settle on the market and the rest of the build-out, with Shake Shack and Tom's Urban, et cetera, over the upcoming month comes on line. When you look at kind of the benefit expenses, as Jim mentioned earlier, as we prepare to kind of grow the company and look at our benefit plans, certain accruals have been adjusted as we level-set [ph] certain of our benefits. That affected us in the quarter, particularly around things like paid time off and those types of issues. And those are more nonrecurring going forward. They're not only normalized, but with breakage and other pieces will come back the other way in future quarters as we move forward. Another component and, really, isolated to kind of 2 or 3 kind of employee benefit line items, so another component is just we're self-insured from a health benefit standpoint. [indiscernible] we have unforeseen items that come up, and incidents in our employee base and that kind of -- that impacted us in the quarter as well, but that should more normalize as we move forward. So when I look at the overall expense line items and look at big-ticket items, I'm comforted in the fact that our FTEs are in line. Our actual wage line, in terms of our salaries and payroll line, is where it should be and in line. In the expense line items that affected us in the third quarter was really a few line item-specific, and we know exactly what cost of those times were.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So absent swings and table hold percentage, you would expect the flow-through for the year to be in that 50% to 60% range?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, I think as we've kind of go through and, obviously, given our business, that flow-through percent is going to move around. I think when you kind of look at the impact of the $40 million, our margins would have been up in the quarter, I think a little over 23%, about 23.1% in terms of margins. And adjusting for these items, we're going to have a pretty good flow-through. But I think the flow-through story really needs to be looked at from a long-term perspective as opposed to a quarter-by-quarter perspective. And obviously, our goal is to continue to focus on margin and margin improvement from that standpoint.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then Grant, the EBITDA, the margin performance in the quarter, a bit better than we all expected. The margin performance, I guess, is the highest at the property, at least more recently. Other than the mix changing between mass and VIP, and you don't really have the benefit like others of strong higher-margin retail revenues, what's driving that, that margin component? How much of it is outside of mix? And then if you can share with us what you're seeing broadly in October, and if you want to talk about it on a relative basis. But if you could share anything on October trends in Macau, that would be helpful for all of us.","Grant R. Bowie","Okay. So thanks. So mix is important, that's true, and we're starting to get to that point, that critical next point, tipping point where the revenue mix is starting to move pretty rapidly towards the mass, which is good. So that's been significant. The critical point was that several months ago, even back into the almost 6 months ago, we started to see some indicators, and so we started to make sure we were putting a lot of effort into managing costs and just controlling those expenditures and making sure that we knew where it was going. And frankly, probably we have done an even more positive job in terms of managing those costs because it's actually lifted the margin as well. So I think it just continues to be the same simple process we've been going through, and that's really a fine sense of focus on execution, really working the analytics, getting the front -- getting a really good indicator where we think the market is going to move and try to anticipate that and really keep it all together. And I think that's really important. To the second part of your question in terms of October, I think it's important for us to now step back. We, for many years, all looked at Chinese New Year and we looked at -- so National Day holiday being the big spikes in our business. And I think if we look back to the first quarter, we all started to see that, in fact, the Chinese New Year bubble had dissipated some. And actually if we went back to National Day last year, we saw a similar effect where the growth wasn't as pronounced month-on-month. And I think that's consistent with actually the trend in China now where the government is now trying to flatten out these spikes. So I think we need to look at it in a trending position, and we need to look at the traditional holiday periods not in the same light as we did before. And that's actually positive because I think we're going to see the business going right through. No question that the numbers you've seen come out from the government, the market is up a little bit. Hold is obviously affecting number of us, it's obviously being a little patchy in that regard. But in terms of the mass business, given all of the other challenges we're seeing, it's still pretty stable, pretty consistent. And we continue to be positive in moving forward.","Operator","And the next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Dan, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on some of your group commentary in convention business. As we think about your performance on the Strip with respect to group in convention relative to broader lodging and start thinking about next year, do you guys feel you could be a share taker? And maybe within that context, obviously, the 1Q comparison is extremely difficult with the rotating show. Could you comment a little bit about how you foresee the 1Q playing out?","Sarah Rogers","Carlo, it's Sarah. I'll answer a little bit and then Dan can add some color. So this year, we're looking at pacing to about 17% convention mix, which is a record for our company. Our pace continues to be up next year. And despite outperforming our target by at least a full percentage point this year, we should meet, if not do better, than the 17% mix next year with kind of a low- to mid-single-digit rate increase in convention. Obviously, we had a fantastic first quarter of this year with 14% REVPAR, and we have a big convention that rotates out in the first quarter. But that being said, I'll reiterate our comments from the last call, which is it's our goal to increase REVPAR at least every quarter of next year.","Corey I. Sanders","And I would add, Sarah, we feel -- we always plan on stealing market share. We're very strong in this segment, that's why we're adding the 300,000 square feet at Mandalay Bay. We're pretty much maxed out in peak periods. We're fully utilizing the space. So the way we're going to get the market share is the addition of our Mandalay Bay's plays, but also utilizing the space that we currently have in much better ways and aggressively buying back from customer space that we see is an opportunity for us to increase the convention market.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then Grant, if I could, just further up on Joe's question earlier. If we thought about your segments between mass and VIP and, obviously, acknowledging that a lot of the move is going to be from that advantaged margin mass business. Could you kind of comment a little bit on maybe the margin integrity within the segments? Are you seeing any one being overly promotional? Or asked differently, are your mass and VIP margins relatively steady?","Sarah Rogers","I think maybe Jim can answer that.","Grant R. Bowie","Jim, you want to take it out?","James Joseph Murren","Well, maybe I'll grab that and, Grant, maybe you can join in, too. We're really quite impressed with how Grant and the team have been doing on the mass side. And I know there's been a lot of chatter around mass and who has the competitive advantage around this. I spent enough time at Wall Street to know that the important thing is just to look at the numbers, that would be helpful. And if you do look at the numbers, you'd see that our mass GGR grew 34% in the quarter versus the market that grew but 16%, and Cotai was only up 19%. So MGM China up 34% versus Cotai. The peninsula is where the premium mass has been outperforming. We continue to expect that to happen. We wish we had more hotel rooms at MGM. We're proud of the fact that we have the highest EBITDA per room in the industry. And we know that our rooms drive revenues, which is exactly why we're excited about MGM Cotai. We're also excited about phase 2 to actually build more hotel rooms in Cotai. We think that with the market growing as it is in the mid-teens, there is room to grow without discounting. And I know that some of the operators have tried to compete with discounting, but that's not a winning strategy and it doesn't really motivate the customers, which are motivated by the quality of the amenities and the service. And in that case, we performed very, very well because of Grant and the team. And so we don't see any need for discounting. And the fact that we're dramatically outperforming the market without doing that speaks to why that's important.","Operator","And the next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, I just want to take it back to flow-through. It sounded like with some of your prepared remarks, previously you've said that flow-through for the company, your kind of objective is to have 50% to 60% flow-through. And from your prepared remarks, it seems like while this quarter had a bunch of puts and takes, you haven't really veered from that strategy. So I just was wondering if you could just touch on that and perhaps reiterate your goals there.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, sure, Felicia. This is Dan. That still and continues to be our goal. And we're looking at that, not from a quarter-by-quarter basis but overall longer-term period, and we continue to kind remain focused on that perspective. I think when you look at even the third quarter and adjusting for the items we discussed earlier, we'd be roughly at about 40% in the quarter and north of 40% for the year. And so I feel that with the investments we're making, with some of the positioning of the properties in the portfolio, I feel like we're right where we kind of need to be from that standpoint. There's still more work to do, but we continue to remain focused on maximizing the profitability of these buildings.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just a few kind of property-specific questions. On the Bellagio, the REVPAR growth was lower than we expected, especially given how some of your peers performed in the market. I was just wondering if you could give us some thoughts on the REVPAR performance there and how we should think about that going forward.","James Joseph Murren","Well, I'll start that one, then I'll turn it over to Corey. But you're right, I think there is room to push rate here at Bellagio. Bellagio did well, but the convention rates, in particular, were lower than what they could have been. And one need only but to be here as Bill Hornbuckle and I walked from here to Vdara and saw how crowded our conference and convention facilities were. I couldn't even get through the hallway, the place is teeming with people. We're having a monster month in terms of attendance here at Bellagio in terms of conventions. And they're benefiting from fair values than they should. So yes, these are rates that were established a couple of years ago in some cases, or last year. There's opportunity, which we will take advantage of, of driving rate here at Bellagio both on the convention side and the FIT side. And we firmly expect to be able to be much higher in terms of rates in the future. You want to add anything?","Corey I. Sanders","I agree, Jim. We've been focused on this the last few quarters in particular. We haven't started pushing rates. We do have a lot of old business on the book that will clear its way out, which will help that graded achievement thing.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How long do you think it will take to clear up that old business?","Corey I. Sanders","Probably 6 months. I mean, it's already starting to clear itself out. We just hired a brand new Vice President of sales here at Bellagio who is extremely focused on this and driving the rate in that segment.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then on -- at MGM Grand, so we all know you had $18 million low hold, in the effect on low hold in the quarter. I'm assuming that was all at -- was most of that at Mirage?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Felicia, this is Dan. It was a combination. So when you look at the individual properties, Mirage from a year-over-year and a normalized level was the largest decline. They were actually well below normal and well below prior year. The MGM Grand on a year-over-year basis held well last year, held more normal this year, so they were down from that perspective as well. Those are probably the -- from a hold standpoint, the 2 biggest change, slightly offset by Bellagio being a little bit better year-over-year. They held towards the low end of their range, and they were more normalized this year.","Corey I. Sanders","[indiscernible] MGM was about almost 9%.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just finally, on Grand, you guys historically have a lot hold -- high hold, low hold, just different events there that affect your results every quarter. So when you look historically backwards and you look at your EBITDA margins for that property, they're pretty volatile. Is there any reason to think on a normalized basis that, that property wouldn't have the same kind of flow-through as your corporate goals are stated?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","No, I wouldn't think they would be that much different.","Sarah Rogers","So long it's measured on a long-term perspective.","Operator","And the next question comes from Shaun Kelley with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This question is probably for Jim or for Corey, but I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing at both the high end and then the core or mid-tier portfolio in Vegas. I mean, I think you guys see a broader cross-section of the market than just about anyone else. And wondering if you've seen kind of any pickup pretty early on the core side of -- for the consumer at this stage.","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. Shaun, it's Corey. REVPAR was pretty consistent across luxury and core, they were both up pretty consistently. And we're seeing spend -- the revenue spend. And we look at revenue profit kind of a little bit more [ph], we're seeing that up also, about 3% to 5% at luxury and core across. So I think the consumer is getting better and healthier here and the core is picking up definitely from -- my guess, is the consumer confidence and lower gas prices are helping those properties.","James Joseph Murren","Yes. Maybe just to be clear on that. The REVCOR, the revenue per occupied room, was up in -- if you take the casino out, right, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders","That's right.","James Joseph Murren","It was up 6% in the third quarter. That's a strong quarter on revenue per occupied room. And I think that signals, again, the strength of the consumer. And we're seeing that both at the core properties, as well as at the luxury properties. So if you -- we can't do this because we are in the casino business, but if you look at the non-casino portion, that revenue per occupied room was up nicely in the quarter. And that's encouraging.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it does sound like the gap between those 2, which has been pretty wide over the last 12 to 18 months, is that narrowing? Or -- I mean it sounds like it is, but like you said, just kind of wondering what's your comment.","Corey I. Sanders","We've had a good few quarters actually in core, and a lot of that is dependent on as long as the convention business in town is strong. But the confidence in the core properties even when the convention business is not here, we're seeing some pricing ability, which we haven't seen in the past.","James Joseph Murren","Yes. And I would add, Corey, that we believe in 2015, the convention business will be stronger in the city than this year, and that is the critical element to the success of the core properties. Yes, we're going to build share in the convention business as we have this year, we'll build share, we believe, in '15, yet the luxury properties can do well even if the convention business isn't growing rapidly. But the core properties are dependent upon citywides. And even with that big convention that won't be here next year, we believe that the convention business will be higher, which will benefit the core properties. And we think and believe, by expanding the Mandalay Convention Center, that will help at least 2 of our core properties that are right next door and perhaps others because many of these new conventions are booking segmented rates, so that will be in the Mandalay Convention Center, but get room rates from us from a variety of our properties, including core properties, to give their delegates options on pricing. So we believe that the core properties next year will benefit from a better citywide, the investments that we're making like in Monte Carlo, in New York-New York, the expansion to the Convention Center, the fact that Delano has become a big social media, a phenomenon right now and is very popular, will help those properties. And narrow, I think you're right, the gap between the success of our luxury portfolio and our core portfolio.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful. My last question just to be -- just a follow-up on the Delano. When this -- there isn't more non-gaming element to it, when this debuts, and now you've kind of pass some of the preopening, the question is, is there much of a margin impact pause or negative as that ramps? Or can it ramp with decent enough margins that you're not going to see, let's call it, negative mix from a low-margin property ramping?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. Shaun, I think, with a thousand rooms, the impact will be positive on the margins. So how significant, it will be neither to little. But we're seeing a pretty significant rate increase in there of about almost $40 from what we're experiencing before. I think what else we're seeing is, we're seeing the convention segment actually being attracted to that product in the past, but it's been more of a flow-over. Now they're actually asking for that business. And the third component of that, the casino customer never stay in the Delano or The Hotel. And we're seeing some demand for that. So you take off hotel, that was probably rated about at Mandalay Bay and you get that extra dollar amount, you push some more convention business in there, it can only help margins.","Operator","And the next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On Vegas, on the renovation disruption, should some of it -- is some of it going to leak into 4Q? And then is there anything planned for 2015 just as we think about kind of the comp there?","Sarah Rogers","Tom, this is Sarah. So in the fourth quarter, ultimately, margin flow-through, they tend to be skewed towards the back half of the quarter as it's such a highly focused gaming quarter on western New Years. So we'll kind of have to wait and see from a hold perspective. As Jim mentioned, we're having a great convention quarter. I think that the mix is up about 3 percentage points in the fourth quarter, so that's fantastic. I also would remind you that we did have a strong margin fourth quarter in last year. And we highlighted those benefits on fourth quarter call last year with certain accruals, PTO reversal and some in-line adjustments as well. So just to be aware of that comparison.","Corey I. Sanders","And then on the fronts, the Shake Shack wall and Tom's Urban wall comes down in mid-December. So I think you'll see the free flowing of people. So you'll just have a little impact the first few months, and then it frees up near the end of the year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","The more and more connectivity we get between New York-New York, the park, which shall have a, I call it, kind of a phase 1 in early '15 connecting to Monte Carlo, the more and more connectivity between those buildings and attractions we create on that west side of the Strip should, over time, continue to drive more foot traffic to the west side and, ultimately, into those buildings.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then -- I mean as you build out the convention traits [ph] at the Mandalay and you build the arena, I mean will those impact numbers at all?","James Joseph Murren","Well, there's really no disruption to expanding the Convention Center. It's a surface parking lot that people don't walk by or through. So there's no disruption there. And there's very minimal disruption on the arena. The biggest disruption there was traffic going into Monte Carlo, the vehicular traffic has been challenged because we're building the park and then the arena. We've got a lot of construction traffic around that. So that has an impact not on pedestrians, but it's more challenging from a vehicular perspective. So the answer is no on the convention expansion, yes, to some degree, on the arena. Although it's accessed primarily from the back of the arena. And those are the 2 big elements for '15.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You're helpful. And then just quickly, Grant, on the smoking ban, I don't think I heard you mention anything about that. Can you just give us some color on how it's impacting or not impacting?","Grant R. Bowie","Well, it's been implemented and, obviously, it was a little bit confusing when it was implemented, but we went through it. And we're still refining it, and we continue to refine it. It has had some impact on some player behaviors, but it's way too early to say what it's going to mean going forward. But it's a day-to-day exercise when you keep trying to address the issues. We are discussing with the government to further clarify and understand exactly how we should appropriately implement in accordance with their guidelines.","Operator","And the next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","A quick question on Vegas. No one has touched on food and beverage. When you think about how much money you made in food and beverage back in 2007 and then what you're making now, how big a gap is that, an EBITDA gap is that? And do you see a closing? Or how quickly is it closing?","James Joseph Murren","I'm sorry, can you repeat that?","Sarah Rogers","I'll handle it a bit, Harry. So food and beverage revenues were up 9% in the quarter and a lot of that was driven by catering business due to strong convention calendar. So we should continue to see that grow, especially as corporate customers as a percentage of our convention customers grow, and they now represent over 60% of our future booking.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Right. But how much of an EBITDA impact might it have as it rebuilds over the next year or 2 is my question.","Sarah Rogers","I think we have to go back and look at what the spread opportunity could be and the margin opportunity. We can come back to you offline with the number.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then, Grant, as it pertains to VIP, it's kind of a dangerous question. Is your sense that there's any stability in this, in your customer base yet?","Grant R. Bowie","Well, it's transitioning. I don't think it's an issue of customer bias, I just think we're going through a realignment more than anything else. And that's been going on for some time and it's being well discussed and well reported. The operators are still seeing customer flows. Yes, it's down on previous experience, but they're starting to reconsolidate in there. The feedback we're getting at this time, it can be a little more positive as they readjust to the new conditions.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And as it pertains to promotional environment in the premium mass segment, a lot has been made about how there's risk to your margins. How much risk do you think that there is to your margins in the premium mass business over the next year?","Grant R. Bowie","Well, I guess, Harry, the obvious proposition is we knew the market is starting to be challenged, and so the actions we took several months ago, you're starting to see the effects today. And that is about making sure we offer the services and, more importantly, we direct the sorts of returns to the customers that they're looking for. A lot of wasted money goes into marketing programs on activities and costs, but actually the customers don't value. And that's really where we spend time. So that's how you manage pricing as much as anything else. And I think we're really focused on that. We are going to stick to our knitting. We know what we're good at, we know what we're capable of doing. I think some on the market may feel the need to take a pricing initiative, but I guess, I've been in the business too long, I know that's not a good course. It's a very short-term response, and it really doesn't help anybody. So we want to stay out of that, we just got to focus on making sure that we deliver value to the customers, and they want to keep using our facility.","Operator","And the next question comes from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just one of the -- a longer-dated question. Is some of the capacity that disappeared and now seems to be coming on over the next few years for Vegas? Can you just give us a sense for that, what you're seeing there? I mean, Genting, it looks like they're moving along. Do you think that as the economy improves, you'll see some of the other projects jump start at over the next couple of quarters?","James Joseph Murren","Well, Steve, it's Jim. I'll try to tackle that, although it's not clear. But we are excited about Genting, in particular, because we believe given the sorts of the capital, location of the company, it will drive incremental and new customers to Las Vegas. And we're rooting them on. We like it to be open sooner rather than later because we don't believe it will just necessarily cannibalize existing capacity. We do believe it will drive new customers, and we think we'd be a beneficiary of that. So we're sure leading that one. The other one that we're aware of that is tangible is James Packer and our partner and friend, Andy Pascal. That's going to be a much smaller, more boutique-like property, probably Las Vegas standard boutique and focused, we believe, on the higher end, and higher-end non-gaming, which I think is a good strategy, and we're encouraged for that. But for those 2, we really don't see anything. The Fontainebleau remains a haven for wild animals. It doesn't seem like there's any activity going on there whatsoever. We don't hear of any other properties that are on the horizon. So if you were to add those 2 to the mix and include only those 2, that's a pretty small amount of capacity adding to the market and it's many years away. So we think that as the Las Vegas visitation continues to grow even in a low single-digit rate and that the citywide convention business steadily recovers to its postrecession level, which we believe will occur in the next couple of years, the existing properties, all of which will do well, ours and our competitors. And our hope is in that rising market, we just continue to take more and more share through the investments that we're making to try to make these properties more adaptable to the current consumer which, as you know, is more spontaneous, more experimental and more fickle. And so by creating these outdoor spaces like Caesars has with The LINQ, and we're doing at our properties, we think that is going to drive incremental visitation to our properties within that rising market.","Operator","And our last question comes from Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first one on Cotai. In your release, you slipped in the word \"fall\" into talking about the opening day. I think, last quarter, you talked about just being 2016, which kind of suggest maybe better visibility. But also in the last couple of days, your partner was quoted saying that there may be delays. And so I wonder if you could tell us about how you feel about the visibility of -- in the opening date there. And then I have a Vegas question as well.","Sarah Rogers","Grant, you want to take that one?","Grant R. Bowie","Sure. Thanks, Robin. As you well know and you heard, that we're pouring an awful lot of concrete and a lot of steel. And you are correct, we are just refining the plans, we're very comfortable working with the contractor that we now got a lot more accuracy and a lot more sense. Still some challenges as to licensing, but even that process we are starting to get more comfort in understanding how that process is going to work. So that's really what it is. We're just trying to provide a little more guidance.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And to the comment about -- recently about like potential delays, would you say that you feel better now than you did a few days ago in terms of that? Or I'm just trying to understand how...","Grant R. Bowie","I think the fact of the matter is that program is pretty accurate. We're not seeing any delays. Our contractor is pretty comfortable and confident in terms of labor. In fact, they got lots of more bodies coming onto the site as the work gears up. Materials sourcing is right on track, and we are working through that process now. So we're pretty confident. I think the comment was a general observation for the market, but we're pretty comfortable -- we're pretty well honed in on what we need to do to get the job done.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my Vegas question is, when you look at the quarter, REVPAR up nicely, but the gaming revenues even as kind of looking at slots as maybe a measure of broad markets since I knew there were pieces moving on the hold on the table games business. But does it seem like -- when you look at the trends overall for the year that, are convention visitors maybe kind of crowding out? Is there a tradeoff here where if you want the 5% higher REVPAR, you give up the gaming revenue growth maybe? And that may be the best decision. I'm just wondering if that's what you feel is happening when you look at the tradeoffs in REVPAR versus gaming revenues.","Corey I. Sanders","Robin, it's Corey. With regards to convention customers, depending on the convention, some play, some don't play. The REVPAR -- our slots were up on the Strip in a very tough market and even to the increase in convention mix. And it's been that way all year long, actually. There used to be on an all-period that it was a one-for-one tradeoff, but I don't believe that's necessarily the case anymore.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I don't even mean for MGM. I guess I just mean market in general. I mean the market spot and revenue growth on the gaming side, hasn't been as good -- has been fairly flat versus the REVPAR increase. And so it's not even sort of as something different for MGM, but just kind of a market dynamic.","Corey I. Sanders","I think given the dynamics in the United States on gaming revenue due to how positive growth in slots is really a positive sign for the city. And I think it shows the power of our M life program that we're able to have games and slot revenue with increases in the convention market.","Operator","Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing comments.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, all, for joining us. And thank you, Grant, for being on the call as well. And as always, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to any of us for follow-up. We look forward to seeing and talking to you soon. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

After the company\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note, this event is being recorded.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mrs. Sarah Rogers. Please go ahead.","Sarah Rogers","Good morning, and welcome to MGM Resorts International\u2019s first quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at mgmresorts.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website. We furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today\u2019s press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website.","Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Murren","Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Well, it was a quite weekend here in Las Vegas. First weekend of May is always busy here; we have a bunch of events typically, of course Derby and NBA Playoffs, but this weekend was unlike any other than any of us have ever seen, even Bill Hornbuckle, the old guy over there. We had of course the fight and because of fight, we achieved one of our highest REVPAR weekends ever in the history of the company. And since we had the sole rights to the close circuit parties, we hosted dozens of parties around our properties and sold over 46,000 tickets to our guests to watch the fight and then enjoy the rest of what a casino hotel has to offer.","From a gaming perspective, I can tell you that we had record front money coming in, tremendous drop in our properties from a very diverse and global group of players. And a lot of those players are still here. We look forward to talking to you about this on our next call and we\u2019ll provide you with many of the details and some fun facts. As of right now, we are still counting all the money.","This fantastic weekend gives us great confidence in the power of MGM Resorts and Las Vegas, the entertainment capital of the world. I\u2019m pleased to report the net income attributable to MGM Resorts grew 65%, EPS of $0.33 was an increase of $0.13 year-over-year. We achieved Las Vegas REVPAR growth of 1% which is not bad compared to the prior year which was up 14%. Our REVPAR growth was also better than the market as a whole. The LVCVA reported Strip REVPAR that was down 1.5% for the quarter. Obviously the story there is the big Con\/Agg affect which we will get into a little while.","Our regional properties achieved record EBITDA growth of 10%, very strong year-over-year and MGM China maintained its market share. CityCenter resort operations profit decreased year-over-year due to lower volumes and hold at ARIA; Vdara and Crystals actually had record EBITDA quarters.","We\u2019re executing on our plan to improve the free cash flow of our company and the balance sheet companywide. Our convertible notes converted into equity and that took a full turn of leverage off our balance sheet as we continue to improve this through free cash flow and dividends as well. I am happy to report that CityCenter paid its first dividend, a $400 million dividend on Friday. We have been working towards dividends from this project really since we began but now that the pending litigation is behind us, we\u2019re gratified that we\u2019re now able to accomplish that goal.","CityCenter is a rapidly appreciating asset and has demonstrated significant operating growth since it opened. And both partners believe that CityCenter\u2019s strong financial position and the ability to driver future free cash flow positions it to begin returning capital to its shareholders as evidenced as you also saw by the approval of an annual dividend policy of 35% of free cash flow.","MGM China has been a tremendous investment for our company. And while the market is currently going through obviously its only challenges, we are confident that our investments in Macau will continue to benefit our employees, the citizens of Macau and our company. MGM China\u2019s strong balance sheet is prepared to develop and grow in Cotai and beyond.","We recently announced that MGM China has reached an agreement in principal with its creditors to expand the credit facility by $1 billion to $3 billion and lengthened its maturity by year and a half. This obviously shows a great level of support from our lenders.","We believe that the expanded and extended credit facility will provide our company with the financial flexibility to continue to investment in the Macau marketplace whether at MGM Macau, MGM Cotai or future opportunities as they may arrive.","We\u2019re very excited with the progress we\u2019re making here on the strategic investments in Las Vegas. Our arena which broke ground about a year-ago is advancing incredibly quickly and this will open up in less than a year. This is a project that MGM owns 50% of and will invest around $87 million as a part of our equity contribution. We expect that it will provide an excellent return on investment for both ourselves and AEG and of course that will drive a tremendous amount of traffic throughout the neighborhood which we own.","The lower suites and have already been structurally complete in vault [ph] and we will soon see exterior glass curtain walls being installed and the roof will be complete in the next few months. During the first quarter, the arena secured three tremendous partners, Coca-Cola, Toshiba, and Schneider Electric. And at this point that represents about 53% of our pro forma sponsorship revenues already and we\u2019re still in negotiations with eight other founders including a naming right sponsor.","We have signed contracts for over half of the suites and are in contact on about another 30% of them. We believe that this is another validation of that this facility will be a game changer in the market and it will be the best in class seeking for entertainment, music, sports as well as creating opportunities to bring new events to the city. And as we saw this past weekend, events are key driver to visitation and profitability. This facility is certainly going to help MGM and help Las Vegas.","The plaza also received an official brand sponsor and a name, Toshiba Plaza. That two-acre outdoor public plaza will bridge the park and the entertainment district tying together New York-New York and Monte Carlo and of course the entrance to the arena. At Mandalay Bay, the first phase of the 350,000 square foot expansion of our Convention Center will open in a few months in August of this year.","The demand for meeting and convention space has been so high that, that additional space is already booked and will essentially start returning value on day one. And to ensure that our room offerings remained equally vibrant, we will begin renovating our Mandalay Bay rooms this June and that will be fully completed in March of next year.","This momentum is developing countrywide. The team has been very continuously reviewing our development initiatives and have green lit them based on the attractiveness from a return on invested capital potential. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to achieve attractive returns on investments in these new markets as we have had before.","Projects underway now are in many ways similar to MGM Grand Detroit. If you recall, we built that project in 2007 for around $800 million and that property has historically made around a $150 million each year, creating tremendous equity value to MGM resorts, which brings me to National Harbor? I was just there last week and as anyone that knows that area and has been in DC in a while, knows everyone\u2019s asking when MGM National Harbor is going to open.","We recently celebrated the hiring of our 1000th member of the construction force and we are moving forward very steadily to a fourth quarter of next year opening. All the design is reaching completion, architecture is now being seen rising from the ground and we have formally contracted almost 50% of that work.","In Springfield, Mass, we broke ground couple of months ago and we\u2019re targeting a late 2017 opening. That project is progressing really well and we will start ramping up our efforts to secure a local contractor which will move forward with construction this summer. This development project feels to us a lot like MGM Detroit in many ways from a return in revenue perspective, and we\u2019re very excited about it.","And in Cotai, we\u2019re obviously well under way with our construction and we\u2019re thrilled to see our distinctive architecture coming to life. Our towers have reached the 19th floor with a target to top it off by the end of November. We\u2019ve also been making great progress on our spectacle roof which is now being raised and well been in place [ph] 25 meters in a year, amazing to see. And we remain on target for fourth quarter 2016 opening.","With clearly priority of like diversification in our minds, we\u2019re taking steps there to complete our designs with a major focus on non-gaming amenities, our atrium for example, situated at the heart of the resort is going to be enriched with unique elements that we think will mesmerize our guests. The theater will be one of a kind space, never constructed before and we\u2019ll transform that entertainment experience to our guests. This will be a world\u2019s first and we we\u2019re ecstatic about offering that to the Macau marketplace.","Our joint venture with Diaoyutai of course is building hotels throughout China and has made great success, most recently developing the Bellagio in Shanghai which will open next year. And of course, we cross-market our properties in Asia, in Las Vegas and beyond.","And before I turn it over to Dan, I have to have a few moments here about our friends at Land and Buildings. In January of this year, Land and Buildings asked for a meeting with me. You all know me well and you know I enjoy speaking with shareholders, large and small; analysts; investment banks; everyone, we\u2019re always learning, we\u2019re always open to ideas and I communicated that at the time. The next step was that Land and Buildings filed to nominate four directors to our board, and then the deck was put out without anyone at our company reviewing it, including myself. It suggested that MGM Resorts pay a $2.6 billion special dividend out of MGM China, sell assets, create a REIT and whole bunch of other stuff. The pitch was filled with mistakes and very poor assumptions and we said so at the time. But let me be very clear. The concept of a REIT is not a new one. Our board has evaluated REITs for years and there\u2019ve been many reasons for not pursuing them in those prior years. Obviously during the recession, those reasons included very depressed multiples; we weren\u2019t even a tax payer; we had unduly high leverage; and many others.","That said, our business model is evolving and so has the market and it is important to regularly view all opportunities. And I think our board has reflected that in these many years we\u2019ve been together. We\u2019re persistent in looking for ways to unlock value. The company\u2019s done so in the past, will continue to do so in the future. We regularly engage with our very smart financial, tax, legal advisors to review opportunities in our company and we are doing that again. In fact, we\u2019ve been doing that intensively for the past year. These outside advisors are exploring a REIT structure for our company. It\u2019s complicated, it will take some time to thoroughly evaluate it, we\u2019re not sure of the current outcome of that. We\u2019ve added another advisor to our already large team. We announced Evercore recently and they\u2019re working with our other corporate finance and capital markets advisors and legal advisors to review what our other advisors have been working on.","So, in summary, I can tell you that the existing board and management team is taking all the necessary steps to create shareholder value for you. In fact, two of our largest shareholders have board representations and are supporting our board and our management team. We\u2019re aligned with our shareholders in the desire for sustainable value. This proxy contest is truly unwarranted as the board and the management team are well equipped to create value, have done so before and we\u2019re well equipped to look at REIT\u2019s and any other opportunity. The stock has done very well over the last five years, up 135%. And I am proud that we were able to rebuild this company throughout this post recession period. We\u2019ve rebuilt it for our shareholders, our employees and the communities in which we serve. And I have to just say that I am sorry that we\u2019re going through this; I am sorry that it\u2019s devolved into a tabloid like campaign and it shouldn\u2019t happen.","But with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan D\u2019Arrigo and you can talk about our operating resorts.","Thank you, Dan.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Overall, net revenue for our wholly owned domestic resorts increased slightly which was driven by our non-luxury Strip resorts and our regional properties, while being offset by our luxury Strip resorts.","In Las Vegas, we had a really strong January with REVPAR up double digits; February was in line with our expectations, low to mid single digits; but March was more challenging than we had anticipated. As you know, the entire city faced the tough comparison in March, given the large city wide that Jim mentioned earlier, was in town last year last year, and rotates every three years. Excluding that one week of Con\/Agg on a year-over-year basis, our REVPAR would have been up 6% in the quarter. Our convention mix, for the quarter, improved year-over-year resulting in a record at just over 23% of total room nights. But with less city wide convention room-nights year-over-year, we weren\u2019t able to hold occupancy as we anticipated and that impacted all of our business segments.","Looking at the second quarter, our convention business continues to build and we are expecting a slight improvement year-over-year in convention room-nights. We expect REVPAR growth of at least 5% in the second quarter, driven by growth at corporate meetings and convention business, a strong event calendar and the trends we are seeing thus far. Our regional properties, as Jim pointed out, had a great quarter as our best in class resorts continue to drive revenues via incremental expanded visitations supported by the strengthening domestic consumer.","[Indiscernible] had its best first quarter EBITDA since 2007 and our wholly-owned U.S. regional property EBITDA grew 10% year-over-year. Geographic diversity has been a key strategy for MGM Resorts and our success in the region only supports our expectations for return on investments in both Maryland and Massachusetts.","CityCenter\u2019s resort operations in terms of its EBITDA decreased by 14% year-over-year due to lower table games hold and volumes at Aria while Crystals and Vdara had at least record results. Aria\u2019s reported EBITDA of $61 million was a decrease of $14 million year-over-year, primarily due to 250-basis-point decrease in table games hold and lower volumes as a result of some of the impacts we\u2019re seeing at a Mainland sourced Chinese front end business. Aria\u2019s hotel business continues to improve with the record REVPAR of $219. They were able to achieve 4% REVPAR year-over-year driven by a 9% increase in convention room-nights and a 7% increase in ADR. Vdara had a record EBITDA during the quarter, driven by a 5% increase in REVPAR and Crystals\u2019 also had its best EBITDA quarter ever with $12 million recorded during the quarter, a 6% increase year-over-year.","As we announced on our last earnings call and as part of our global settlement related to the outstanding Perini and Harmon claims, CityCenter reported $116 million gain in the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, CityCenter paid its first dividend of $400 million on Friday and we received our 50% share or some $200 million. That dividend is one of many strengthening elements for our balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.2 billion, of which roughly $469 million was in MGM China. We also had $1.1 billion in available liquidity under our corporate revolver and approximately $1.4 billion of excess cash on hand.","On April 15th we successfully converted our $1.5 billion convertible notes into a net 71.7 million shares of MGM common stock. This conversion was a significant event for our company as we improved our domestic leverage by approximately one turn and improved our free cash flow by eliminating almost $62 million in annual interest expense. The conversion reinforces our improving balance sheet story as we continue to position the company for future growth.","At the end of March, MGM China had approximately $950 million of debt outstanding and $1.1 billion in availability under its revolver. CityCenter cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $524 million, total debt at the end of the quarter of approximately $1.5 billion and we\u2019d like to point out that this does not account for the $400 million special dividend that was paid out last week.","During the first quarter, we invested approximately $92 million in capital related to our domestic operations. We also invested approximately $54 million in National Harbor and MGM Springfield during the quarter. In addition, we invested approximately $19 million as part of our arena equity contributions. There in the first quarter, MGM China spent approximately $14 million at MGM Macau and $132 million on our Cotai development.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Grant for his MGM China report.","Grant Bowie","Thanks Dan, good morning, good evening.","Again in first quarter, MGM China performed relatively better than the challenged market with net revenue down by 33% year-over-year, while the market itself was down some 37%. Controlling cost and margin, a high on our priority list and we\u2019ve strategically put in place numerous initiatives and restructuring our cost base and also obviously managing cost specifically. But we still remain committed to offering the high quality experience that our customers have come to associate with our property here in Macau.","Despite these challenges, MGM China was able to maintain its outsized market share of 10% during the quarter, a situation that we\u2019ve been able to do consistently over the last three years.","MGM China is all I think strong in our mass market and we continue to outperform. But our main floor table games revenue was declined by 14%. This is in comparison to the broader market decrease of 19%. We continue to compete with the focus on targeted marketing efforts and high quality offerings and best in class services and standards.","Our mix shift towards the higher end margin main floor business continued in the quarter with 50% now of our revenues and approximately 80% of MGM China\u2019s EBITDA contribution coming from the mass market. We continue to shift tables from VIP to the mass with additional 44 table units being moved to the main floor this year versus last, representing now approximately 55% of that table allocation.","On the VIP side, VIP table games revenue decreased by 45% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower turnover which declined 51%, while hold increased slightly to 3.3% from 3% in the prior quarter. To echo, Jim\u2019s earlier comments, we\u2019re thrilled to see the progress we\u2019re making in Cotai. And when I go out on the site these days, it\u2019s tangible to see the changes that are taking place from visit to visit. And we remain on schedule to open in the fourth quarter of 2006. This timing remains contingent on our saving the necessary government approvals, including our future life of quarters. [Ph]Our objectives in bringing diversification to Macau is undeniable on the offerings we have planned MGM Cotai, and it is clear that our current high standards will carry through in the quality of the non-gaming amenities that we\u2019ll offer at our second resort in the market.","We look forward to our future of growth and more importantly, we want to grow our business with our team members, particularly our local talent. In fact, 26 of our local managers at MGM Macau just came back from Las Vegas after an intensive 10-day operational cross-training and immersion program, where we\u2019ve been able to prepare them for the advancement in our organization as we mature and grow.","Right now, more than 80% of the management team at MGM Macau are local employees and we\u2019re committed to meet with our local young people as our business grows.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn back to Jim for his closing remarks. Thank you.","Jim Murren","Thanks Grant. Just a few things and then we\u2019ll turn it up to questions. And obviously, this weekend was tremendous and it was a very profitable event for MGM and the Strip; the city as a whole tremendously benefitted from this worldwide event. And I have to commend all the stakeholders in doing so, the first responders Metro; Fire Department, the County all collectively worked together to create an exciting and safe environment that only Las Vegas can deliver on.","And I think it\u2019s a testament to the collective energy of this town that we\u2019re able to deliver uniquely in the world, deliver this type of entertainment. And the party continues, Rock in Rio is coming to the north end of the Strip on our new festival lot. Over the next couple of weekends, tens of thousands of more people will be here. People that love to watch Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars and Metallica and the list goes on, and then of course we have some major performers in our arenas Bette Midler and Eagles. It\u2019s really a great line-up in the second quarter.","Our convention business continues to show very strong demand. Our lead volumes were up 70%, over the first quarter of last year. And corporates are driving over 60% of the booked room-nights. And you know how important that is from an ADR a non-gaming spend perspective. The completed expansion in Mandalay based convention center will clearly help us capitalize even further on this strong corporate demand and that bodes very well for all of next year.","This company operates on a core set of principles and values that have guided our business and have ultimately led to our success. Over the past five years, we have dramatically improved the balance sheet, as consolidated leverage is now approximately five times and our cost of borrowing has been cut in half. Our EBITDA margins have increased by 320 basis points in the wholly owned properties from 2010 to through 2014. And we have also one very competitive bids for key gaming markets that will drive future growth; of course, in Massachusetts and in Maryland. Our board and management has worked hard together and we will continue to deliver sustainable long-term value to our shareholders.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Emily to move into the Q&A section of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Joseph Greff with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph Greff","Question for you all with respect to your outlook for the last Vegas trip and Jim some of this may be you answered in your closing comments. But when you are internally forecasting across all metrics for the last Vegas trip, is it getting easier; is it improving; is the visibility improving? And maybe I ask in the context of that mainly mainland Chinese player or resort guests and particularly non-Chinese international guests that might be impacted by FX. And then when you kind of roll up the 5% REVPAR growth for the 2Q, must have added about 16 on as you mentioned it Jim. How much of a benefit you think you received from this past week and what obviously was tremendous? Thank you.","Jim Murren","Well, maybe I\u2019ll start and then anyone jump in; I think Bill wants to talk about China and Dan or Corey can jump into. Our REVPAR guidance, we\u2019ve made it a point to get as specific as possible over these many years. We\u2019re getting better and better at forecasting this on a REVPAR perspective. I think some of you thought we are sand bagging here because we kind of beat our REVPAR guidance for two years, or three years in a row every single quarter. And we\u2019re a bit short of it this first quarter and the reason for that was some softness in March. But we were up; we knew it was going to be tough; everyone knew it\u2019s going to be tough but we fell little bit short in the month of March. We had a tremendous January, tremendous February and a little bit of weakness. April, we were up, what 4%? So REVPAR in the month of April snapped right back. And obviously we had a very great weekend and forecast for REVPAR we gave you for the quarter, we feel very good about it.","We don\u2019t understand the more negative views that I\u2019ve heard about what\u2019s happening in either of the current quarter. And certainly, it\u2019s perplexing to have any kind of constructive opinion on the summer at all given the fact that those booking windows are so short. What we can say is we have a tremendous amount of business on the books for the third quarter as well in the convention side.","So, we\u2019re feeling with 42,000 rooms very comfortable with our guidance in terms of REVPAR even taking into account the negative impact of stronger the dollar and undoubtedly a negative impact of mainland Chinese customers coming to Las Vegas. But I\u2019ll turn it may be over to Bill for it. Do you want to say something there?","Bill Hornbuckle","As it relates to Las Vegas, China business, I\u2019ll remind everybody because just came up on the last call, we used less than 5% of our total cash flows in Las Vegas. So put it in perspective and keep it there. We were down about 30% collectively; it principally obviously showcased itself through Chinese New Year. If you put all that together, it\u2019s maybe 15 million or 20 million in net gaming revenues. I think the other thing Joe to your question is to just understand the value of the dollar going forward and watch Middle East, Europe and Latin America, we\u2019re watching that closely, the value has gone up between 20% and 30%, depending on the market which I think if we go through the balance of the year, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll watch. And then the balance of Asia: Japan, Korea Taiwan has responded exceptionally well as we\u2019ve refocused our energy and our people towards those markets.","Corey Sanders","And Joe, this is Corey. What I would add is the March softness was really isolated to the first few weeks and in particular the Con\/Agg week which was here last year. We could identify the weakness to those periods. And actually if you look at the past five years from an occupancy perspective, the first quarter is pretty much in line with where it normally is without Con\/Agg expo. A few other points that give us some comfort, air capacity is growing at 3%. When you take the citywide out of the visitation which we were down 110,000 just and Con\/Agg was 160 of that, we\u2019re actually up in visitation when you take that week out also. So everything we see in our business, there hasn\u2019t been much of a change from what we see.","Sarah Rogers","Joe, on your question about REVPAR at the Mayweather weekend, Mayweather benefits us by about 1% for the second quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Corey, a question for you just on the cost side of things, and I know it\u2019s hard to talk about flow through this quarter. But as we think about the 50% goal, I am wondering if that still stands for the year and where are you seeing most of the cost pressures and what are you doing to offset those?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Felicia, I am going to jump in first and then turn it over to Corey. I think when we look at our overall cost structure, it\u2019s pretty much in line with where we expected, our costs were up about 2% in the quarter, our FTEs were flat year-over-year. So, we feel good about how we\u2019re managing our costs and there is always room for improvement that maybe Corey can touch on as well, but that\u2019s part of our normal process. I think as we look at follow-through, again we look at it from and I know we said this in a past, a longer perspective. And we continue to look at the longer opportunity from a margin perspective and continue to look at flow-through for longer period of time because quarter-by-quarter we\u2019re going to get these ups and downs and that happens from time-to-time.","Corey Sanders","And Felicia, we\u2019re very focused on margin; with that flow-through will happen. Once again, as we look at the quarter our 2014 was a very tough quarter because it drove occupancy and high rates plus we had higher table game win, all that stuff would impact margins. When I look at it more towards normal quarter like Q1 of 2013, we\u2019re actually up almost 6 basis points on the Strip in margin.","Jim Murren","And I would say on the flow-through, we still feel like the annual 50% is a good number to use. And we expect margins will be up this year as a company, as they have been over the last four years.","Felicia Hendrix","And Jim, why have you -- when you think about your portfolio of properties under Strip and notwithstanding all that ebbs and flows just quarter-to-quarter and different things going on like tough comps and stuff like that. Are we at the point of the lifecycle right now in the Strip where we\u2019re going to see better improvement, better recovery and your low-end? How should we think about that as for us modelers going forward?","Jim Murren","A few things, so on the quarter, we\u2019re talking about Bellagio\u2019s margins were 29.5%, and that was better than their peer group; that was better than win in the Las Vegas stands in Las Vegas in the first quarter. We think that our flagship properties, our luxury properties had the ability even during a tough convention comp like in the first quarter to drive revenue. And we expect those margins to improve as well.","So, I would look at the Strip, maybe three categories of properties we have, the luxury properties; growing revenues; and margin because we\u2019re getting better mix. And then particularly as it relates to Mandalay, a tremendous impact on mix given this large convention expansion which not only should help Mandalay, it should help Luxor and Excalibur, as you are driving business. But one is, the properties at the luxury end have been more isolated, less vulnerable to swings and citywide conventions.","On the next group of properties, we call our core properties, those are the ones that really benefits from inherent demand in citywide convention business and have the ability to grow margin and EBITDA greater from their current base. And we feel that way because we see what happens when we do have a large convention in town or mega fight or something of those metrics; we just get huge snapbacks in revenue and profit at those core properties. And so looking at it as a portfolio, I think that we can grow everywhere but mostly the core properties can do, I think better as the convention business improves. I think that REVPAR in the first quarter for core was actually up, it was up 4% and that\u2019s without Con\/Agg obviously being here.","So looking forward, I feel the power that we have and the opportunity is the operating leverage of 42,000 hotel rooms and using them as a collective portfolio, we can drive revenue in all of them but it\u2019s clearly the core properties are more dependent on the city-wides than the luxuries are.","Corey Sanders","And I would add, I think it\u2019s been at least the last three quarters where the quarter\u2019s percentage increased and REVPAR had outperformed the luxury. And so I think that\u2019s going to continue; they have a lot more to go from peak. So that\u2019s why I think they have that opportunity to continue to grow more.","Felicia Hendrix","Just last housekeeping, the $8 million hold -- negative effect on EBITDA from hold in the quarter, was that from one particular property or could you just tell us where it was from?","Corey Sanders","It was kind of sprinkled around a few Felecia, with actually Bellagio, Mandalay and believe it or not, MGM Detroit as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Carlo Santorelli at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santorelli","A two-part question actually. If you look at the 2Q and the 1Q sequentially in years past when we look at periods that include Con\/Agg expo. I get the sense that even if we were to ignore the 100 basis-point benefit from the Mayweather fight that the plus five is conservative based on some of the historical seasonal trends. If you guys could address how you\u2019re thinking about it with a plus four for April with the 100 basis points for Mayweather and the seasonal sequential changes in dollar REVPAR on the Strip that would be helpful. And then just one quick follow up, when you guys think about flow through and you think about the 2% kind of cost escalation, net revenue on the Strip north of 4%, is that fair to say in terms of being able to drive that 50% flow through you guys have spoken about?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Hey Carlo, this is Dan. I think you\u2019re fairly accurate in terms of kind of where the REVPAR the -- the overall net revenue growth would need to be to kind of get to -- get in and around that 50% level with a plus or minus 2% kind of increase on the cost side. I think when you look at the REVPAR characteristics going forward, we always knew that the first quarter was going to be our most challenging quarter and that the comparisons for the rest of the year were going to be stronger because of Con\/Agg. And I think as you look at April and May and the second quarter being the driving months, June actually shapes up pretty well for us, given our group business that\u2019s on the books but it\u2019s typically the -- and normally the weaker of the three months in the quarter, in terms of that flow.","Carlo Santorelli","And then just on the 3Q, as you think about the book of business for the 3Q; what percentage of your room nights at this point in time are generally on the books for the third quarter.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Remember, the city as a whole is about a 60 to 70 day -- inside 70 day kind of booking window, so in terms of the visibility. And so you start getting into August and September and we\u2019ve got good visibility in terms of our group bookings. We feel good about how the leisure\u2019s shaping up. There is a little bit of softness in some of that international leisure travel but we think we can fill it up with some of the domestic business that we\u2019re seeing and some of the airlift that we\u2019re going to see in the summer months that Corey mentioned earlier as well.","Jim Murren","I think we just booked a really big piece of business in August, didn\u2019t we?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yes. In the year, for the year.","Jim Murren","So, we\u2019ve been booking in the year for the year pretty effectively here. So, I would say that the third quarter\u2019s looking pretty solid for me relative to, seasonally relative to where we were even last year.","Carlo Santorelli","Yes, thanks Dan, thanks Jim.","Operator","Our next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Was there any suggestion that 1Q is impacted by high rollers that delayed their trips to come for some of those special events this month? Thanks.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Thomas, this is Dan. That\u2019s definitely a fair and accurate statement as folks delayed some trips to come in for this weekend\u2019s fight for sure. And they came.","Thomas Allen","And came?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","And as Jim said, they\u2019re still here.","Jim Murren","I got one little fun fact. So, I asked aviation to look at this, I sent Sarah a picture of this. So, the most planes we ever had at Atlantic Aviation was 350 planes, that was during the Super Bowl weekend. This past weekend, there were over 500 planes. And Sarah can send around the picture. I cannot believe how they shoe horned these planes. And by the way by 10 o\u2019clock yesterday morning, they stopped receiving planes in Las Vegas and they were diverting planes to North Las Vegas, an airport I\u2019ve never been to, because the demand was so great. So there was a tremendous amount of play in here. I guess having planes is a good thing, because we certainly, we were flying all night, all day long and so were our competitors but we saw a lot of tails out there that we\u2019ve never seen before and that was clearly a reflection of people coming in for the fight.","Thomas Allen","I saw a similar picture; that was very impressive. So, just as a follow-up. In the past you\u2019ve talked about potentially monetizing Crystals; can you give us your latest thoughts there? And when you talked earlier about considering a REIT option, would you consider REITing out the whole company or just putting the company up or would it, maybe just the regionals or just a Strip or anything like that.","Jim Murren","Sure. I\u2019ll tackle Crystals and then the REIT ideas. We had explored the potential sale of Crystals a couple of years ago. And we had high level of interest for the issue that potential buyers had at the time was what is the growth story and how does the Perini litigation impact potential ownership of Crystals, and what you are going to with that Harmon site, it\u2019s about 2.2 acres once you resolve your issues with your contractor. We didn\u2019t have any answers to those questions at that time. We were in middle of that litigation. We didn\u2019t have a plan for Harmon what that site would be. And so we just got to a point where we didn\u2019t feel as owners we were going to get paid for the potential growth opportunity of Crystals.","And so fast forward to today, it was only last month that we settled with Perini. And almost immediately after that the CityCenter board started working on plans of what to do with that land which obviously could include expanding Crystals and making it a growth vehicle for a potential owner. We have a keen interest in finding the right buyer for Crystals. And we have been smart to wait because the NOI has been growing steadily at Crystals and the tenant mix is improving. And now the growth story is very much intact. And so, I would anticipate we along with our 50% owners of CityCenter will be viewing that as a very strong opportunity to monetize what is -- easily well over $1 billion asset to the owners. And so that\u2019s where we stand with Crystals; it\u2019s being actively discussed at the board level; and we hope to have something to report at some later date.","As it relates to REIT, I\u2019ll go back to \u201807 when we first started talking about that as a company. And then of course the recession hit. We were building CityCenter at the time and I guess we didn\u2019t have a crystal ball to know that we were going to have the global recession and financial crisis that we had. But it was always part of the plan to find ways to monetize some of our real estate, certainly CityCenter was based in part on that when we developed condominiums that we expected and hoped to sell at a nice profit. Now here we are on the other side of that great recession. We have more opportunities than ever before. We are a very much a real estate rich company.","About the only thing I did agree with in the land and buildings discussion is that we are undervalued and have undervalued real estate. Now, how to unlock that value is something that we along with a very strong group of investment bankers and our team here have been working on. And REITs could easily play a pivotal role, a central role in fact in how we unlock value, whether that is at our regional properties; whether it\u2019s at our core properties; whether it\u2019s at the company at large or elements of our portfolio. And it\u2019s certainly attractive but also asset sales are attractive. As we have sold assets in the past, there is no reason why with rising cash flows and rising multiples the value of real estate here in Las Vegas has gone up as witnessed by REITs in trades even this year of two older casino properties that have been transacted at really nice values per acre.","So, we are in a position of strength, a very different place than we were back in \u201808 and \u201809 when we were in a position of weakness. We will use our strength to the advantage of our shareholders in negotiating the best possible values for any of our assets. And I think we\u2019re well advised legally from a tax perspective and from an investment banking perspective. And I think we have been well known as a company that\u2019s active in either capital markets hitting windows when they\u2019re open, transactions, joint ventures, asset sales and we are very busy right now I can say.","Operator","Our next question is from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","Just as a follow-up on that point. Dan when would you expect to be cash tax payer?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Harry, we\u2019ll take some taxes this year; it\u2019s less than 50 million this year in cash taxes.","Harry Curtis","And so 2016, any idea what\u2019s your cash tax rate might look like?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","From a cash tax standpoint, go up a little bit but nothing substantial in \u201816.","Harry Curtis","I wanted to also get an opinion from Grant. There is a bulging capacity and Macau begins relatively soon. And I am wondering what your contingency plans are as you think about maintaining the market share that you\u2019ve so far successfully defended?","Grant Bowie","I wouldn\u2019t call it a contingency plan because it\u2019s actually cited [ph] plan. The critical point, I think we all are focused on is that we just need to continue to grow. I think the thing that we\u2019re obviously now also managing is the speed at which we need to diversify into the non-gaming. So for us, it\u2019s really about acquisition, broadening our base, we obviously now are very strong in premium mass and mass business and we obviously continue to do that. And I think that\u2019s a discussion you and I had probably 18 months ago. We\u2019re putting those structures in place, very pleased to have those coming together. And I think that\u2019s a critical point. We all know what\u2019s coming on stream and structures we\u2019re putting in place is responding to that as well as allowing us to double the size of our own business. Does that help?","Harry Curtis","It does, but you raised an interesting point about the non-gaming element of it. What indications have you gotten from or definitions maybe, have you gotten from the government on how you fulfill their definition of non-gaming amenities?","Grant Bowie","I think that\u2019s what we are all working through, but I think if you look at each of the companies and I know from our perspective, we\u2019re very focused on entertainment and building the entertainment base for ourselves and then on top of that we also add food and beverage and the retail concepts; others may be looking at other areas. Clearly in Cotai, we\u2019re also looking at building out targeted mass business, particularly focused on the incentive component of that. So, I think the critical point for us is that I think all of us who have been in the tourism and leisure industry understand what the landscape looks like. I think what we\u2019re doing is making sure that we pickup components that fit comfortably with our strategy and that work well with the type of product and the type of customers that we\u2019re targeting. And from the work that we\u2019re being doing today and as Jim indicated, we\u2019re very comfortable in terms of being part of the creative process and tapping into that consumption growth of China.","Operator","Our next question is from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead. ","Robin Farley","One Vegas question and one Macau question. For Vegas, on the last call you talked about the remaining quarters being up more than 2% to 3% of REVPAR; and I know visibility -- there is a less visibility further out you go but would you reiterate that about Q3, Q4 at this point or maybe just take more a of a wait and see. And then I have a Macau question as well.","Jim Murren","I am comfortable saying that.","Robin Farley","And then on Cotai, you mentioned that you are on track for the Q4 2016 opening, I\u2019m just wondering if you can give some color on the worker quarters that you have, does -- you are on track today, does staying on track require additional labors or can you still open at that scheduled point without any increase from what you have today?","Grant Bowie","I think the critical point is, is it\u2019s actually -- the labor pool changes from one set of skills to another set of skills, such a different group of people. So, the numbers we\u2019ve got, we\u2019re tracking well. We\u2019re very lucky we have a very strong contractor in China today and clearly that\u2019s part of their key responsibility. But I think we\u2019re conscious of the market conditions at the moment and we\u2019re obviously doing everything we can to make sure that we design, develop, and execute this to make sure that we can get this done as quickly as we can.","Robin Farley","So, it sounds like if maybe just to get the visibility on, you mentioned the labor pool that your needs will change over the next couple of quarters. So, it sounds like there are still kind of changes that will need to happen and with this labor as you go through the process?","Grant Bowie","There certainly will be. And as I said, we\u2019re all very conscious of those needs and our contractor has been very proactive in trying to anticipate where their needs will be and trying to work through those processes. So, as best we possibly can and in support and cooperation with the Macau government, we will certainly get there.","Operator","Our last question today is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Shaun Kelley","We\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, so I\u2019ll try and keep it short. But Dan, could you just let us know what the outlook is for MGM China dividend at this stage, particularly as cash flows there are under some pressure and then of course you are ramping up construction into Cotai?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","As you know Shaun, the board there has approved up to 35% of income annual dividend that\u2019s paid semiannual. So that will continue to be reviewed and looked at by the board. As a matter of act will be taking to the annual general meeting here in May in a couple of weeks the final 2014 dividend declaration and that board will continue to assess that piece. As far as special dividends, I think that will be something that that board will continue to look at, based on not only market and individual performance but based on overall needs as we continue to ramp up, obviously in Cotai and continue to invest in MGM Macau. So, that piece will continue to be assessed on a go forward basis case-by-case.","Shaun Kelley","Can you just remind us if there is a -- is there like a leverage maximum or any sort of leverage constrain covenant wise that people should be aware of?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","In the bank agreement, it\u2019s -- I believe it\u2019s five times for MGM China.","Operator","That concludes the question-and-answer session today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Murren for any closing remarks.","Jim Murren","Well, thank you all for joining us today. And as always, we\u2019ll be around for any follow-up questions. We look forward to seeing you out here in Las Vegas, especially when our new arena opens; we\u2019ll have a party then, sure and obviously at National Harbor and all the activities we have going on throughout the year. Please feel free to give us call at any time. Take care.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Joining the call from the company today are: Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings, Limited. [Operator Instructions]","Please note this event is being recorded. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mrs. Sarah Rogers. Please go ahead.","Sarah Rogers","Hi, good morning, and welcome to MGM Resorts International's Second Quarter Earnings Call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at mgmresorts.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website, and we furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those -- in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, included in our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website.","Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. We think this quarter is a really good example of the power of being a leading operator here in Las Vegas.","Our Strip properties drove the bulk of our EBITDA growth this quarter with wholly-owned Strip EBITDA, up 12%; and CityCenter resort operations EBITDA, up 20%.","MGM China posted a real solid quarter and increased its margins and EBITDA, and that was driven by an increase in mix from the high-end main floor business. That high-margin business continues to grow for us.","Our key markets are continuing to grow, and we continue to invest and focus where we see opportunity.","In May, for example, MGM and AEG broke ground on our new arena here, targeted to open in mid 2016. This is going to be, really, a spectacular arena, and it will attract a lot of new events to the market and enable existing events that we host to grow in scale, and that is a very important component to our goal of ensuring that Las Vegas continues its leadership in entertainment, and we, at MGM, continue to capture an outsized share of that business.","In June, New York-New York unveiled its Hershey's store to great success, and it's adding 2 new restaurant venues, Tom's Urban and the ever popular Shake Shack, which will open up in December.","Mandalay Bay is winding down its remodel of The Hotel into the Delano.","At this point, over half the rooms are complete and the name, I'm happy to say, is up on the building. The official opening is scheduled for September 1, and we believe that the Delano brand, combined with a spectacularly remodeled property, will command far better rates and attract a higher-quality, higher-margin customers.","Ultimately, that's the business that we're in of creating unique experiences for our customers. And with that in mind, I'm pleased to announce the hiring of Lilian Tomovich. Hi, Lilian.","She is our Chief Experience Officer and she is reporting to Bill Hornbuckle. Lilian will join from us and has joined us from MasterCard, where she ran the Consumer Marketing in the United States. She's now responsible for developing and executing guest interactions across all marketing channels with a goal of improving the guest experience company wide. We're very excited for this.","On the development front, MGM National Harbor in Maryland has received all the necessary approvals, and we've actually begun construction there. We selected the Maryland-based Whiting-Turner as our general contractor for the project, and we've hired HKS as the design architect and Smith Group as the architect of record out of the D.C.","As you probably know, the mid-Atlantic market is driving and in finalizing our plans for National Harbor, we have recently increased the scope of the project, expanding the footprint from 2.8 million square feet to 3.3 million square feet.","In addition, we have modified our plans to create structure and flexibility to build out yet more incremental space on the second floor if demand in the future warrants that, and we think it will.","Based on these more detailed plans, our budget now is $1.2 billion, up from the $1 billion that we announced earlier and almost all of that is due to the increase in scope. We think this will be one of the most successful U.S. resorts outside of Las Vegas.","I just got home from a couple weeks in Japan and Macau. I have to say, we've been spending quite a bit of time in Japan, and we remain quite optimistic for legislation this fall. We're looking at all the markets there, and we now have a full team deployed there, with offices in both Tokyo and Osaka. I think that MGM is really well positioned in Japan, given our globally recognized brand, the market leadership we have in the convention and events business here in Las Vegas and a recognized award-winning builder of sustainable, integrated resorts, which is a key core value of Japan.","We have also proven, which I think will help us there, in multiple jurisdictions around the globe to be a successful partner with key local stakeholders, and we've been meeting with several local companies over the past year.","From there, we were in Macau, and we visited with the 1,200 construction workers that are actively working on MGM Cotai. There is actually a tremendous amount of work of being done there and has been on a daily basis since we began construction.","Remember, we went down 3 floors and a substantial amount of superstructure work, basement work had to be completed, and now we're moving up into the tower. We'll talk about that a little bit later on.","And so with that, I'll turn it over to Dan D'Arrigo to talk about our operating results.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We are continuing to deliver consistency and improved operations as this is MGM's seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year Strip EBITDA growth and margin improvement. All of our properties on the Strip showed year-over-year improvements in EBITDA.","We are seeing a more unified recovery as luxury Strip properties grew EBITDA 13%, and our combined mid-tier and value resorts increased by some 8%.","Our mid-tier and value resorts actually outperformed the luxury portfolio in terms of REVPAR growth for the second quarter in a row.","On the casino side, the market was led by extremely strong Baccarat growth. Our wholly-owned Baccarat win was up 64% in the quarter and non-Bacc table games win was up 10%.","Clearly, the customer relationships we have developed in Asia are benefiting MGM Resorts in Las Vegas, and we expect this trend to continue.","On our last call, we guided for 5% Strip REVPAR growth during the second quarter, and we actually achieved 6%.","We were able to grow our convention mix by about 1 percentage point year-over-year during the quarter. The in-the-year, for-the-year convention businesses is filling in nicely, and we now expect our full year convention mix to be above 16%, 1-6 percent, and actually above prior peak levels.","Looking at the third quarter, we expect to continue to grow our convention mix and anticipate REVPAR growth of approximately 5% in Q3.","At CityCenter, second quarter EBITDA from resort operations increased 20%, led by ARIA's strong 23% increase in their EBITDA contribution, driven by increased table game volume and hold.","REVPAR at ARIA increased 6%, including record quarterly occupancy of some 94.4%.","Vdara had a record quarter, driven by a 10% increase in REVPAR and occupancy just inside of 95%.","Crystals reported another strong quarter of $11 million of EBITDA, up 12% compared to the prior year quarter.","As you saw in the release this morning, MGM China announced its semiannual dividend of approximately $136 million, of which $69 million will be distributed to MGM Resorts on or about September 1.","Including this declared dividends, MGM China will have distributed approximately $762 million in dividends to its shareholders this year alone.","Moving over to the balance sheet. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.4 billion, of which approximately $658 million was cash at MGM China. We currently have approximately $1.2 billion in available liquidity under our corporate revolver, while MGM China had approximately $1.4 billion in availability at the end of the quarter under their revolver.","CityCenter cash at the end of the quarter was $346 million, of which approximately $157 million was restricted cash.","During the second quarter, CityCenter prepaid approximately $150 million in outstanding debt, lowering its outstanding debt balance to approximately $1.5 billion. Leverage at CityCenter at the end of quarter was 4.7x.","Just last week, we successfully repriced CityCenter's Term Loan B, reducing annual interest expense there by approximately $12 million going forward.","A little bit of an update on CapEx. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $114 million in capital at our domestic operations. MGM China spent a total of approximately $64 million, of which $4 million was spent at MGM Macau and approximately $60 million on the continued development of MGM Cotai.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Grant Bowie.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Dan, and good evening, and good morning. MGM China property EBITDA was up 3% year-over-year, at $225 million before branding fees of $14.5 million, and that was on net revenues of $828 million, a decrease of about 1% year-over-year due to a lower VIP hold and lower turnover.","Our EBITDA margin increased by 90 basis points year-over-year due to the higher contribution, as Jim indicated, from the high-margin main floor business. The VIP turnover decreased by 10% year-over-year. Our overall hold rate was 2.7% with -- compared with 2.9% last year due as we indicated to lower in household.","Hold negatively impacted our EBITDA by roughly $14 million year-over-year. A number of lower performing junket tablets were relocated to main floor since the beginning of the year, a strategy which we will continue as we balance our allocation to maximize our yield.","We had a record quarter on the main floor operation. Main floor table games win increased by 41% year-over-year, and this is the second consecutive quarter of outperforming the overall market growth.","And this growth was being driven at MGM and on the Peninsula, in general, and is reflective of a sustainable appeal of the MGM and other quality venues on the Peninsula. The main floor table games and slots continue to grow as a percentage of our EBITDA and during the second quarter, represented 77% of EBITDA, up from 70% last quarter.","This high contribution from the mass has certainly increased our stability and improved margins.","Slot handle increased 13%, but our slot revenues decreased by 11% year-over-year due to lower hold. But we continue to be one of the top market share properties in the slot segment.","The Peninsula, clearly, continues to be an attractive and growing market. To maintain this in the future, we will continue to reinvest in our MGM Macau property, leading up to the opening of Cotai.","MGM Cotai construction is moving along at full steam, as Jim indicated, and we are nearing the completion of that extensive basement work and now we can move at pace on to the construction of The Hotel tower. And this project is on budget and on schedule to open in 2016.","Meanwhile, the Peninsula, we are continuing to execute our yield focus optimization initiatives, and we still see opportunity to further improve the efficiencies at MGM Macau.","We continue to identify additional table yield improvements in both VIP and in mass, and with product upgrades, we are refining the management -- the MGM experience for our customers.","We're also focused, as we've indicated in the past, on building our customer base to drive growth, which will help us to prepare for the opening of MGM Cotai. MGM Cotai will greatly expand our operations in Macau, as the property will have nearly quadruple our room base and triple our growth floor area, which will allow us to expand our reach into the retail and entertainment. These will all create opportunities for earnings and margin improvement.","And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren","Thank you, Grant. And I just got to also thank you for your efforts there. It's quite clear to all of us, and I'm sure it is now to investors, that Grant and his team are the most seasoned operators in Macau. Grant himself has been a pioneer in the marketplace. He invented the sky casino concepts that others subsequently copied. He invented the premium mass segmentations with our supreme and platinum lounges, which have been so successful for us and others have taken note and copied.","MGM has the best win per day in the market in the mass segment and as Grant mentioned, we're consistently one of the highest market share companies in slots.","And we've always outperformed the market when we have seen periodic slowdowns in the VIP business in Macau.","We've never had a more integrated set of operations between MGM China and MGM Resorts as we do right now, and that combination is yielding very strong cross-marketing results.","We're seeing it also accrue to the benefit of our employees as they move back and forth between companies. It certainly has helped us on customer acquisition going both ways. It has helped us tremendously in employee retention in Macau and also here in Las Vegas.","A little more on MGM Cotai because we've made great progress there, and it's such a dynamic market, I know there will be questions and updates. We're happy to say that we've now awarded about 50% of all the contracts, which is why Grant has more clarity on the $2.9 billion budget. We haven't missed a beat on construction, and we have received our permitting, both for the superstructure and for the MEP, and we continue to be the kind of company there, the government expects us to be, which is always highly compliant in doing all the right things.","We're 3 floors below grade. That creates a lot of work for us, but ultimately, when opened, it creates great operating efficiencies for the employees, and we think that will have a benefit on margin once we're open.","We're also pleased to announce a couple amenities that we haven't disclosed before. We have engaged David Rockwell, a world-class designer, done a lot of works for us and others in our industry. And his team have been working on the spectacle. This is the large entertainment experience, and retail experience that is at the heart of MGM Cotai that we believe, will be over the top and drive significant interest on the mass side.","We've also designed in and brought in a great architect to provide a SKYLOFTS product as part of our room inventory at MGM Cotai.","SKYLOFTS, for those who know us here in Las Vegas, has been a highly priced part of the MGM portfolio and these rooms and suites with its own VIP lobby, again, we think will be quite attractive to the premium mass customer.","And because we're so far along on MGM Cotai, we're very happy to say that we have been focusing on the second phase of MGM Cotai, which will be all nongaming, continuing to diversify and add likely over 700 additional guest rooms.","This is really meaningful to us because, as you know, MGM has the highest EBITDA per room in the Macau market, and MGM as MGM China will experience the most rapid growth in guest rooms over the next few years, even more so if we're able to build this Phase 2 project adding on to the 1,500-odd rooms that we're building at MGM Cotai.","We have been building up our bench for growth. That -- MGM China has benefited from MGM Resorts in that regard. People have moved over for the opportunities. We're continuing to build on the integration of marketing between the 2 companies. We're continuing to expand our Asian footprint with our hospitality division at MGM Resorts with 2 hotels opened now in Mainland China and more under construction. We're excited about opening MGM Cotai because we know how meaningful it will be to the profitability of MGM China and the benefit that MGM Resorts will get as a result. And we're very pleased with the progress that we continue to see here in our home market of Las Vegas.","So with that, operator, I'd like to turn it over to you for our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Since you entered in Macau, I'll start with Macau. Grant, just a question on your margins. They were definitely better year-over-year. Just the flow through was a bit lower than what we were expecting. Was that mainly driven to the low hold that you discussed, or were you seeing also higher operating costs? And if it was higher operating costs, both WYNN and LVS called out bonus accruals in their releases as partially driving lower EBITDA, and I believe that you guys also pay a 14-month bonus, but I didn't see any commentary in the release about that.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Felicia. I can always know you to keep the pressure on. In terms of the margins, they are pretty claimed. There's really nothing exceptional in there. I think we indicated that we actually had fully accrued into last year's results the 14 months that we actually paid, so we didn't have any adverse effect and, by and large, the performance in the costs are pretty consistent. You are correct that obviously, the low hold had an impact on margin, but the strength for that 41% increase in the mass table games certainly provided the bulk of that improvement. So overall, the revenues were moving faster, the mix change had impact, so I think it's a pretty clean margin number, and we really don't have any unusual costs sitting in our -- any unusual costs that will have a one-off effect because we actually planned for and actually accrued it into the periods.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Perfect, that's really helpful, I appreciate that. And then Jim and team just moving over to Vegas. Most of your retail properties performed better in the quarter than we expected both in terms of REVPAR and flow through. I was just wondering if you could talk for a moment about what's driving that. Would you say it's more coming from company initiatives, or is it more of a general return to the market segment? Is it both? And then also just in answering the question, the one property that did stand out to us as having lower flow through was Monte Carlo, so just wondering if there was anything specific going on at that property.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Sure, Felicia. This is Dan. Yes, when we looked at the second quarter, we were overall pleased with the results. There is always things up and down in each and every quarter, and you're pointing out one of them, which is Monte Carlo. I think overall, we're pleased with the performance, but we still continue to stay laser-focused on the expense side and on the flow through. I think for the quarter, we came in at about 37% flow through in the quarter, which is a little bit below our previously stated range. Monte Carlo did impact that as we continue to kind of position that property going forward. In the second quarter, we had quite a few restaurants and retail outlets that opened up and really are repositioning that property in the second quarter to actually give it a front door, and now we're working through the ramp-up of those facilities and the traffic patterns with a new configuration. So that was impacted in the quarter and clearly, that's something that over time will rectify itself as those facilities ramp-up and take hold. The other piece is probably something to kind of mention, is also about the -- at Mandalay, the Delano impacted our flow through. As we reposition and rebrand that property, you're incurring expenses given the hotel, within a hotel concept that are just hitting expense and aren't pre-opening or aren't capitalizing in any way, shape or form. So as we reposition that property through September and October here to its official launch and fully complete it, that, too, impacted the margins. But longer term, as these properties continue to kind of work through those issues, we think that guidance-wise, flow through is still in that 50% to 60% range.","Corey I. Sanders","And, Felicia, this is Corey. It is partially -- the economy is positive for us, but our company initiatives have really paid off, especially on our yielding front and how we're attacking the convention market. We've been very aggressive in buying back space and utilizing that space, the best we can. I think you've seen us gain even some market share in the convention business, as well as market share in growing our REVPAR.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If you back out Mandalay and Monte Carlo, I think flow through is just about 50%. When you look at the 3Q and the 4Q, obviously, the Delano is going to open up September, October, as you've mentioned, do you expect some of the expenses or some of these challenges to continue in the near term that we should be mindful of, that would get you below 40% to 50% of flow through?","James Joseph Murren","Joe, it's Jim. That's entirely possible. I mean, I think I would look at it in the following ways that the Japanese have a word called Kaizen. It means continuous improvement. And we're doing that on these properties, which means periodically, 1 or 2 of them are going to fall below our target of 50%. And in the case of Monte Carlo and Mandalay, they probably will in the third quarter as well, those 2. We're not giving up, but they probably will as a result of the fact that the lobby at The Hotel, now, Delano is completely ripped up, and we've had to be very generous to our customers to reward them for staying in a property that has been less than appealing going through that process. In the case of Monte Carlo, a lot of start-up expenses as we've been promoting some brand-new restaurants that are new to the entire market. So there's some brand awareness spending that we've been doing. But that target is, I think, a worthy one. And I'd make a couple of points on margin, because really I think that's what you're getting at in terms of the operating leverage in the business. I look back on this, but -- you probably know, but our wholly-owned margins, they peaked at 34% back in the first quarter of '06. Those were good days back then. We all loved those days. And then they troughed in the fourth quarter of '10 at 19.7%, so we went from 34% to under 20%. In this quarter that Dan was just talking about, they increased 80 basis points year-over-year to 25.3%. In fact, that's the seventh quarter in a row that they've been increasing year-over-year. But on a peak basis, if you look at annually, our peak margin, annually, on an annualized basis was 2006. And now, it's 33%. And in 2010, it was only 21%. And I guess, my point here is that our margins have been increasing every single year since the trough. And why that has happened is that we drove revenue through the recession, we just felt we had to do that and revenues have actually held up pretty well as a result of that. But now, as Corey and Dan and others have talked about, we're continuing to improve the mix, and that's why we've done better than we thought on ADR and on REVPAR, convention mix is better than we thought, and we are really managing our costs. Our FTEs, by the way, are up deminimusly versus last year, and they're still down profoundly from 2007, and that is our biggest, obviously, costs. So we're continuing to manage our costs. We're continuing to improve the mix of our revenues, and that's why we continue to expect margins will increase going forward. And why this is so critical, as we know as well as you, that every 100-basis point increase in margin, just using last year's revenue as an example, every 100-basis point increase is $60 million of EBITDA, right down to the bottom line. So I can assure you that, that is an intense focus of ours, we're proud of the improvement in margins. We cannot reasonably expect that every property will have a good flow through every quarter, but as a portfolio, we believe, that they will, and we certainly expect as a company our margins will continue to improve.","James Joseph Murren","And Joe, Delano will open officially in September, so fourth quarter should be fairly clean from those pre-opening expenses.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Corey, how does 2015 look and shape up in terms of group, if you can talk about group pace? And then another question. Jim, you mentioned the CapEx going up due to scope changes in Maryland. Have your EBITDA returned assumptions or under underwriting assumptions changed, along with those scope changes? And that's all for me.","James Joseph Murren","Well, I will take the second one, and I'll turn it over to Corey. Yes, so I mean, the great results that Maryland Live! has generated, our market analysis that's been more precise we're doing quite a bit more work in the Virginia-D.C. market in terms of market potential. Moving over some great personnel into that marketplace. We mentioned earlier, Anton Nikodemus has been involved in the regionals, combined with Lorenzo Creighton and our team. We've put more marketing effort behind here, and we're highly bullish on this particular location, which is why we feel it's very prudent now to not only expand out the public space, which will accommodate more gaming and entertainment, but to create the support structure to build on to the second floor, build the second floor expansion that could include gaming and convention space for the future. So almost -- well, 75%, 80% of that increase is all simply through increasing the square footage of the project.","Corey I. Sanders","And on the convention side, Joe, for 2015, our pace is up double-digit, with rate being up also, and that's despite a tough comparison with CON\/AGG.","Operator","Our next question is from Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Over to Macau, if you could talk about the competitiveness in the mass segment. There's some discussion about it becoming more promotional and, Grant, if you could give us some perspective on whether or not that's true.","Grant R. Bowie","I think it's quite true that as things develop, it always becomes more competitive and I think we all are pretty sensible in this market, and we need to be very focused on the reinvestment rate. As you can see, we have not really seen any significant change and I think our focus will continue and I know a number of other venues are going to be about the quality of experience and the quality of the property rather, than just simply hitting the price button. So at the moment, yes, it's competitive, but I think the focus tends to be on competitiveness through quality of delivery. And different organizations have different constructs, but at the top end, the quality end of the market, I'm pretty comfortable and pretty confident that we can hold the position.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So you see the margins in mass bottom line staying pretty stable?","Grant R. Bowie","Yes. I think if you look through the different groups, the different organizations, Harry, there's already different margin arrangements. And so I think the relationship between the organizations, I think, are pretty stable.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then, Corey, just coming back to your comment about next year. You mentioned the group pace being up double-digit. Can you give us a sense of what sort of pricing you're seeing on that? And specifically, the first quarter is really tough. Can you discuss how replacing CON\/AGG is going from a pricing perspective?","Corey I. Sanders","Sure.","Sarah Rogers","I'll just -- rates for 2015 look to be up kind of low-single-digit percentages, which is actually very good because you're comping against CON\/AGG in the first quarter.","Corey I. Sanders","And first quarter is filling in nicely, Harry. We're actually up in rooms and looking at the first quarter. We're in the middle of our budget season right now, and we'll have better information later on.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So if you're up at this point, low-single digits, you would expect that to lift as we get closer to the beginning of 2014 or '15, rather?","Sarah Rogers","One would hope, but we're also against the challenge of that big week, where you had major rate inflation last year.","Operator","Our next question is from Grant Govertsen of Union Gaming.","Grant Govertsen - Union Gaming Research, LLC","Could you talk about trends in regards to high-end Baccarat play at your Vegas properties? Specifically, are you seeing any incremental VIP play migrate from Macau these days, given the current Macau and China dynamics? Or is it simply the continued ramping of general demand from China and elsewhere, including from your hospitality JV in China?","James Joseph Murren","Well, there's no doubt that we're getting more high-end business here in Las Vegas as a result of our increased visibility in Macau. And the combined efforts of the U.S. operators that are in Macau, bringing customers to Las Vegas benefits all of us here. So we get a good share of that play regardless of who brings them over here. And our competitors get a good share of our customers' play when we bring them over. It's the nature of this business. So that will be the primary impetus for seeing some good Baccarat play. Also, our events have been very compelling. So when we had the Mayweather fight in May, you saw a tremendous Baccarat number in the city and many of us benefited from that. We have another Mayweather fight, by the way, next month in September, which is shaping up to be a highly sought-after event, which is encouraging for that quarter. On the hospitality side, I'd say less so. It's still early days on hospitality. Once we open a hotel in a major market like Beijing or Shanghai, the 2 projects that are under development right now, that will have a bigger impact. But as we stand right now, our 2 hotels are in Sanya, which is in Hainan Island, which really more benefits MGM Macau because of the cross-marketing and the proximity between those and a really small hotel in Chengdu, which is a very luxurious property but very small, and not intended to send a lot of customers here.","Grant Govertsen - Union Gaming Research, LLC","Understood. And then just a quick one for Grant in Macau. You mentioned that slot volume was up notably, but revenues were down. Was that a function of a couple of high rollers dinging you a little bit, or is that the mix issue with more e, electronic, table games and, correspondingly, lower hold rate?","Grant R. Bowie","As you know, we are obviously very strong in the premium end of the market, and you are correct, we did have some players who were very, very lucky. I'm not sure if people understand that those games that they play are reasonably volatile games too, with quite high returns on it. So it's a stabilized, and we have seen coming into this month that we've actually won quite a bit of that back.","Operator","Your next question is from Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have one Macau question and one Vegas. In Macau, I guess, some in the market had thought that July was showing some signs of improvement during the month and then it doesn't look like the month ended that way. And I wonder if you could just give us your perspective on how you see things shaping up in Macau as you sort of look out over the next few weeks? And just to get a sense of whether things have, in fact, stabilized or kind of we're still seeing more June and July trends?","Grant R. Bowie","I think there's been some continued observation that the premium business, the junket business, is still consolidating, still stabilizing. We're seeing volumes begin to increase again. But I think there's a whole series of issues going on that we're well aware, and in China that has taken some of the energy out of the sector and I think we just see that continued consolidation. In the mass business, it just continues to be very strong and I also would see that would likely ramp-up. We're obviously in the summer season, and in some ways, we've seen a couple of years, the summer season, we see some of the business slow down somewhat. We are almost getting some of the trends we're seeing in other marketplaces that during the summer the business is not as strong. But overall, still continue to be very positive on the mass market, looking very strongly at it. Confident in the junket business. See this as a period of consolidation and a comparative realignment, and as we work through this, as we saw back in 2008, 2009 that there is a general confidence still within those operators that as we get into the end of the year and into 2015, they are particularly positive themselves about the growth opportunities going forward.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then on Vegas, just to circle back on you talked about rates being up in Q1 against CON\/AGG, I guess, that was convention rate on the books for Q1 being up year-over-year. Can you give us any color on convention room nights in Q1 on the books versus prior year, because I think would -- I think that will be a difficult comp as well?","Corey I. Sanders","Well, right now, just based on pace, we're up 16,000 rooms in Q1.","Sarah Rogers","Yes. So the General commentary is just across the board in 2015 pace is looking up year-over-year, with a slight increase in rate and that applies to the first quarter as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to try and close the loop on Las Vegas and the flow-through commentary. So just to go back to that for a moment, it sounded like you're a little bit less confident in the third quarter, flow-throughs you guys might see just given some of the same issues with Delano renovation and Monte Carlo. Do you think 50% to 60% is achievable for the year, or with kind of Q2 and Q3 disruption, that's probably not going to happen this year, but then, I guess, do you think it's possible next year to hit that rate?","James Joseph Murren","Well, first, we're just talking about 2 properties. I think, year-to-date, we're 45% right now, even with disruption we've had in 2 of our 10 properties here. So we certainly don't, at this point in time, expect us not to achieve our goal for the year. We were just highlighting in the second quarter, a little bit into the third, but not the full third in the case of the Delano. You can have -- you most likely will have a very strong September as a result of that swinging into very incremental, very additive operations for us, and for Mandalay, in general. So I think we're just trying to highlight the fact that, since the question was asked on why we were a little bit lower than your goal? It was because of those 2 properties. We have -- we know what our expenses are going to be. We have a very good handle on that. We know that room mix is improving, we know that our REVPAR is going to be up this quarter. We know that we're getting out of the summer months soon and getting into the fall, with convention business looking quite strong in the fourth quarter. And so there's no reason why we shouldn't expect to be able to achieve our long-term goals. And in fact, the focus being on margin continued to show the consecutive growth in operating margin.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I think that's a helpful clarification for people. And then the second question that I have would just be, obviously, the Delano is a pretty extensive renovation. You guys have done a lot of work at the Grand and at the Bellagio. As you look into next year, kind of, are there properties that you kind of know or slated for possible renovation activity where you kind of would expect to be more focused with some of your -- probably, your maintenance capital dollars?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","I think, Shaun, as you look out into next year and we will be presenting to our board later on this year kind of the game plan for capital, the one that kind of comes to mind is the standard room tower at Mandalay for next year. So as you think about the Four Seasons has already been done, the Delano is obviously being done right now and with the expansion of convention facilities and the new restaurant product, the logical next step would be the standard room tower at Mandalay for next year, and that's probably the one that would be the priority right now.","James Joseph Murren","And I don't think we -- well, I know we didn't talk about it on this call, we talked about it on the prior call, but remember that we're adding 300,000 square feet of convention space to Mandalay Bay, which is already very well occupied and large. And that breaks ground in about 1.5 months, and that opens up in the third quarter of next year, so we want to make sure when that opens up, that the entire campus is in great shape. We have received a tremendous amount of feedback and support for all of our major exhibition companies that we partner with. And so we think Mandalay is going to have a great year next year anyway, but there will be some disruption because of some room remodeling going on there at the main tower. But that expansion to the convention center, combined with the room product as we progress into '15, will, we think, accelerate the momentum at Mandalay and have, really, quite a monster year in 2016.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. My last question would just be on the Cotai. It's pretty specific. But I think as I look through the circular for MGM China and then versus the Annual Report, it looked like -- in the Annual Report, you referred to early 2016, and now, you are referring to 2016 as the target opening. Am I reading too much into that, or is the timing getting pushed out a little bit there?","James Joseph Murren","First, I commend you still reading that. That's a -- it's a skill so often missed in today's analytical community. But yes, the issue with the timing and the problem with clarity is that -- and we're all faced with this, is that the permitting process is so uncertain as to future permits. There is such a backlog because there's so many towers, so many cranes, so many projects under way right now in Macau that I don't think anyone can, with any kind of precision, tell you exactly when they're going to open. They may say so, but they really don't know. I can tell you that because after spending a couple of weeks there, they just don't know. We have not missed a day. We have China State Construction building our project. They're highly experienced in that part of the world. Labor is always going to be one of the inhibiting factors. We feel that we have the right contractor to get the right kind of labor for the project, and we have received very critical permits, like the superstructure, like the MEP, which is a differentiator for us and very important. And so we feel like we're going to be able to continue to plow through and build this at a very rapid pace. But no one knows for sure exactly to the month or certainly not the day when you can open. We know we're open in 2016. We know that it's going to be in some respect outside of our control. We just feel like rather than to pin down a number or a date, we just have to be a little more general at this point in time. What we will say is that it will be perfect when we open. We're not going to rush an opening and have Coming Soon signs everywhere. So I think that, I wish we could be precise. I don't think any operator can, and we like our chances in that marketplace. But you're right. We have -- we've broadened our language on the opening date because we just -- it's beyond our control, it's beyond any operator's control in that market, and we just feel like that was the better course of action.","Operator","Our next question is from Joel Simkins of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","David Michael Solomon Khabie-Zeitoune - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Michael on for Joel. I just want to get your thoughts on the recent Crown transaction. First, what do you think this signals for Las Vegas Strip land values? And second, perhaps, what do you think it means for the epicenter of the Strip and how you guys are positioned longer term?","James Joseph Murren","Well, we don't have all the information yet on the exact numbers. We saw what was going on. We've talked to some of our buddies, including a couple of principles there, but, clearly, the valuation is north of $9 million an acre. We're not quite sure, exactly, what the number will end up being, but for a company that owns 800 acres on the Strip, we kind of like that a lot. And we have a lot of undeveloped acreage, some of which we bought at even higher prices, back in -- before the recession. But it's certainly a bullish sign for investors that want to come into the market. We have to believe that, number one. Number two, my guess, it's only a guess, it will stimulate the beginning of the Genting project. As someone that lives here, we haven't seen any activity there, but we know it's coming, and that's also, we believe, compelling. Genting and Crown bring tremendous diversity to the customers that we receive in Las Vegas, and we have high hopes for them to grow the market in both cases. And in the case of Crown, they are partnered with Andrew Pascal, who is literally my neighbor and our friend, and a great operator and a great guy, and we know that they'll do something compelling and different. What it means is really not much for today, right, in 2014. We're talking about what Las Vegas might look like in 2017 or '18 or '19. But it does mean that there'll be thousands of jobs created, construction jobs. It does mean that it will help the local economy here, and it does mean that there will be thousands of permanent jobs, when these projects are opened and a lot of marketing dollars spent to bring people to Las Vegas, and more likely more airline lift, particularly internationally given the Genting and Crown relationships in Malaysia and in Australia. So after 3 years of people running away from Las Vegas to see cosmopolitan trade at a good valuation; to see SLS, which I've been through several times, looking, really, cool and great, opening up this month; to see new investors that are savvy, and experienced in gaming and have their eyes wide open in the case of James Packer and Andrew Pascal and willing to invest significant dollars into Las Vegas; and with one of the most powerful gaming companies on the globe, Genting also doing the same, I have to like this. And as someone that has -- we have 42,000 hotel rooms here and better than our fair share of the market in, most, every customer segments, we think that's a very big positive, particularly for the portfolio projects that we have, not only where we are, which we are the epicenter not there -- not only where we are, but what Mirage is all about and further to the North, the benefits to Circus Circus, which has been a lonely soldier up there in the North for quite a while and now getting some much-needed company. We think that's good for our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","After that comment, Jim, maybe you could just talk about your thoughts about Crystals and CityCenter, since performing so well. Any thoughts on either monetizing that asset or buying back the other 50%. I couch that with the great job that Dan's done on the balance sheet, where it's not as necessary as it -- maybe we thought as necessary a few years ago. So values are going higher, it seems like things are going well, why not do something with CityCenter and Crystals at this point?","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, and I'm looking at Bobby and he's done a -- yes, we've done a great job. Bobby has done a great job over there. Obviously, the place is generating a significant amount of free cash. If someone would sit down and figure out what the cash flow is of CityCenter against its cash interest, you'd see what the gift that has arrived for us for both owners, for both for Dubai World and ourselves. So as a major free cash flow generator, we view it as a source of great capital to deleverage the parent, much like we look at MGM China to help do the same. So I think both partners have never been more pleased, particularly given the journey that we've been on, to envision a scenario where free cash flow is generated not only to reduce the leverage at CityCenter, which is already quite low, but the dividend money back to the parents, which would accrue to both parties. Crystals, we did explore potentially selling last year, when the window of opportunity was briefly there at sub-5 cap rates for Crystals. By the time we got our documentation in order, cap rates had moved higher, and we missed that opportunity, and we're glad we did because the NOI of Crystals has gone up dramatically since that time, so -- and cap rates have come back down. We believe that Crystals is a very valuable asset. I think its NOI is like $45 million on a trailing basis. We think it's going into the $50 millions in short order. And so the question for us will become, do you sell Crystals for $1 billion, say, today, or do you wait and grow it and see how you can expand it further, which has potential? But we'll evaluate that. It was always intended to be separate from CityCenter and could always be sold. And so it's certainly an opportunity for us. As it relates to buying out our partners, I think we'll both like owning half of it so much, I'd like to own 100% of it, but you have to have somebody that wants to sell when you want to buy. And our partners don't want to sell, they like what's going on there, they like the free cash flow, they like the growth potential, they see ARIA becoming even more profitable than it is today, they like the fact that Mandarin and Vdara are making money and Crystals having a big growth path. So never say never, but these are discussions that we've informally had in the past, and you have to have a willing partner in a transaction, and both of us like being owners at CityCenter at this point.","Operator","Our last question today will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just some clarifications on your 2015 REVPAR trends in Las Vegas. You guys have talked in the past about how you saw 2014 as kind of a stepping stone and CON\/AGG did create a tough comp, but you really helped to build on that. And so just given your commentary around driving kind of low single-digit rate growth and then, obviously, you're already at pretty high occupancy. I mean, with kind of a low single-digit of REVPAR growth, do you view it as a disappointment? I mean, can you do something better than that?","Sarah Rogers","Yes, and I want to make sure that it's clear that the convention rate and mix isn't necessarily the only driver of REVPAR growth. So next year is a tough comp. We're coming up against CON\/AGG, which is a great driver for convention business. Mike Dominguez and his team are very focused on driving the mix within convention, so corporate continues to be an increase in terms of the percentage of mix and is up from about 55% of bookings to 60% of bookings, and these are corporates that have greater F&B budgets, greater entertainment budgets, et cetera. But absolutely, REVPAR growth can be beyond what we're seeing in terms of convention rate growth. It takes time to push out some of the association business that is in there for multi-year contracts, but we continuously are increasing our pricing in convention regularly.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And, Tom, if I would just add, I would remind you that last time that CON\/AGG was in, we were able to grow REVPAR by some 13% in the following year quarter and that first quarter, we were able to grow REVPAR by 4% on top of that in terms of the year-over-year growth. So the ability is there, and we're going to continue to push on rates, as you see occupancies in these buildings are approaching and in some cases are at all-time peak levels again.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Macau. I mean, you guys talked about Cotai Phase 2, I think this is the first time you really gave us any detail around it. Kind of what are you expecting to spend there? Any timing around it? Any incremental color would be helpful.","James Joseph Murren","Yes. We're going through the planning process of that now. And you're right, this is the first time that we have talked about it, and we've designed it to be able to accommodate this additional tower with several hundred hotel rooms and more entertainment. Probably in the next quarter, we'll be able to give you a budget on that. We have preliminary numbers, but I'd kind of like to show it to my Board first. So I think that what the important point is on that comment is that we have been preparing our submission, we wanted to make sure that we had our permits in place, superstructure, MEP permits in place, we have those. We're now prepared to put together the document that we'll submit to the government. The government process is very specific and has changed, actually, over the past year. And so we want to make sure we submit a perfect document that will be the key to speed for approvals and for construction, and that will be the focus over the next 1 month or 2. And then next quarter, we'll be able to give you a budget on that. I would say that we're very excited about this. We have been a tremendously capacity constrained on hotel rooms in Macau. We have the smallest number of rooms. It's a problem. We continually rent rooms out at the Mandarin Oriental next door and in the city itself. We know that we can drive more mass business, which we've been the innovator on and leader. When we open up Cotai with the triple the number of rooms that we have in our current facility, and if we can expand it even further, then we think the ROI there is pretty spectacular. So we'll give you the budget on that, but the point is that we're now so far along on Cotai, with 50% of the project let out and, really, rapidly a pace that we could get to the position where we can petition the government for the Phase 2.","Sarah Rogers","Thanks, guys.","James Joseph Murren","Take care.

Participants are in a listen-only mode. After the company's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please also note that today's event is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo. Please go ahead with your conference.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and welcome to the MGM Resorts International third quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and we have furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions under the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about our performance.

Finally, please be reminded that MGM Growth Properties will be holding a separate earnings call after this call at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. And can I say, boy, we've been waiting for this call. We're incredibly proud of the entire MGM Resorts team that contributed to these really epic results. And since they speak for themselves, so I'm going to keep my comments a bit more brief than as normal to make sure we have plenty of time for your questions. But let's just be clear on a few highlights. Revenues were up 10% year-over-year, and adjusted property EBITDA was up 25% to over $750 million. Our domestic resorts revenue increased 8% and the cash flows remarkably increased 31% on a same-store basis, and that was led here by continued strength in Las Vegas as well as the very productive hard work to grow our share really nationwide.","We delivered incredible growth from not only the top line, but as you can, see from an EBITDA perspective. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA growth and we produced the best same-store net revenues and cash flows at our domestic resorts since 2007. How did we do this? Driving on our profit growth plan with pristine execution, that was evidenced by our cash flow margins, which have consistently grown since we launched the plan. As of the third quarter, our margins stood at 31% on a same-store basis at both of our Las Vegas Strip resorts and our domestic resorts compared to 24% at the end of 2014, when our management team and board began this planning process, from 24% to 31%. And that, as you know, is well ahead of the plan we laid out.","In the third quarter, we achieved $78 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA and that includes $5 million of contributions of our 50% share of CityCenter. We're running run rate close to our $400 million target already today on PGP. But to be clear, this does not by any means imply that we are done. The profit growth plan was originally designed to inspire new way of looking at our business. We knew then it was not a simple quick fix, and it certainly was not just another cost-cutting effort. The plan required many months of careful planning across all 14 properties, each with thousands of employees as well as thoughtful coordination and messaging to guarantee its success and sustainability across our platforms.","We put in a tremendous amount of effort to get there, a really unprecedented level in our industry. And I think that's important to bring out because it has resulted in a permanent cultural change in our organization of which we all are proud.","We have changed this company literally at its very core. From the level of sophistication in the way we look at our business and our customers to the future of the industry, its evolution and what MGM's role is within this industry. We built the building blocks that have created the success we see today. We are leaders in innovation and operational excellence. We have the deepest commitment to corporate and social responsibility. We have the deepest and most sincere and concerted effort to invest in our people, the development of our corporate culture led by talented, passionate and experienced leaders, that's what has led us to where we are today. That is committing us to building this powerful destination brand that's really unlike any other in the entertainment and hospitality space.","We have been disciplined and very targeted in our capital investments with extremely high returning projects, such as the expansion of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center and the remarkably grossing arena, T-Mobile Arena. And we have scoured the landscape and have found accretive transactions, which we have made as an opportunity to participate both at the MGM Resorts' perspective as well as the premier triple net in the gaming space today, MGM Growth Properties, the company we own a 76% economic interest in.","And at MGM, again, we remained focused on generating free cash flow, strengthening our balance sheet, and we have a very near-term goal of becoming investment grade. But we didn't get there overnight. We've been working on that since the depths of the recession. It has been the result of the dedicated effort of over 70,000 men and women that work at MGM Resorts, many of whom are listening today. And to them, I say thank you for creating the company that we have today, a stronger company, far more capable of growing than its peers, far more capable of winning in the future.","We're excited about that future. We're excited about the future of Las Vegas. We're excited about the future of MGM National Harbor, which will open up in just about a month in the Washington, D.C. area. We're excited about MGM Cotai, which is going to help expand and define the growth of the Macau market. We're excited about MGM Springfield, which literally almost singlehandedly will turn around the fortunes of a once proud but struggling city. And we believe we'll do well in that marketplace as we employ 3,000 men and women in that market. And we know we can win, as we have won before, if selected high-value markets open up because MGM is the company that represents the present and the future in the gaming industry and we're continuing to be dedicated to providing value to all of our shareholders.","And so with that, operator, I'd like to get right into the Q&A. I'm sure we have a bunch of questions that we'd love to answer.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question today comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions, one in Las Vegas and one for Macau. In Las Vegas, looking into next year, if you could discuss your visibility into the pricing power next year. This year has been a terrific success. And maybe direct your answers to demand after ConAgra so we can get a sense of the same store \u2013 what the same-store results might look like on a more normalized basis.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure, Harry. This is Dan. I'll take that one and Corey you may chime in as well. But 2017 is shaping up quite nicely across the board. As we look at our convention group business, we're sitting on today roughly about 90% of the contracted room nights in that sector already on the books and usually by this time of the year we want to be at about 80% to 85%. So we're ahead of plan there overall. And obviously, ConAg is a big benefit in the first quarter, but the rest of the year looks equally as strong overall. So we're pleased with the way 2017 is shaping up.","Probably a little too early to give specific 2017 guidance, but based on what we're seeing right now, I'd say generally speaking, we're seeing kind of plus or minus mid-single digit rate growth into 2017, which is pretty consistent with what we've seen over the past few years here in the Las Vegas market. So I would say it's pretty much steady as she goes at this point and 2017 is shaping up to look as good, if not better, than 2016.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","And my follow up is for Grant. For the time being, the MGM Cotai will have a locational and infrastructure disadvantage, but how long do you think that's going to last? And how are you marketing to overcome any temporary disadvantage?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Thanks, Harry. Hi. I don't see anything like that as a disadvantage. Clearly there are some challenges. We obviously will be very excited to be opening in what we see as being the sweet spot of Cotai over time. When it's come on board, it's obviously going to keep developing and we're looking forward to coming on board. We understand that we need be very focused on connectivity and transportation and we're working through all of those things. And as a result of that, we acknowledge that all the new operators coming to the market have ramped up a little slower than expected. And what's critical for us is that when we launch our programs, we basically see our opening as only the start of our whole activity. And we will be presenting many different activities, introducing and reintroducing as we bring on board some of the other facets of the property.","I think we've indicated before that The Mansion and the theater will be coming on in a staged approach, and therefore, they give us opportunities to have many additional opportunities to create first impressions. So we're very aware that we need to maintain the marketing and noise intensity in the marketplace to drive visitation. It's not a one-off exercise. It's a planned, consistent execution and we pride ourselves on those facets.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Can you give some specifics on which segment or segments you're targeting?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Firstly, we want to focus on the segments where we can drive traffic ourselves. So the mass market is something which we have great strength in and we want to look at that as well as opportunities that we may have for our other in-house VIP traffic. We've already indicated that we are not likely to open the property with junket, but we're still in discussions with junket operators because we understand that it's best that we build the momentum of the property and then we bring those participants into the business. So focus on the things that we're really good at, focused on the things we can control, drive foot traffic through the food and beverage operations focusing both on the Macau market, Hong Kong, and then expanding that reach into China, drive trial into the hotel because we have a lot more hotel rooms.","So everywhere we're looking, we're wanting to tap into the opportunities of increasing momentum and making sure that we lock in a customer group before we move on to other areas. We have a very extensive program already laid out and we're now working through the details of making sure we can communicate that consistently and accurately. Remembering, Harry, that as we've indicated to you, we drive the MGM brand and we want to make sure that we maintain the intensity on Macau as well because it's very, very important to us. So whenever we go out of market, we'll have a new property in town but what we're looking to do is also drive incremental business into the Macau property as well.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Harry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And Grant, while you're kind of in speaking mode, anything on the mass side at the property? Clearly, tremendous growth in your mass table footprint. Is there anything you can kind of comment to provide a little bit more color on that end?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","I think it's actually looking like there's a number of sweet spots emerging. The high end premium mass has obviously been a little quiet for some time, but we're starting to see strength in that area come back, repeat visitation, increased frequency. But the area that we've been working on for quite some time is that mid-upper mass business. And it's starting to get positive traction and from us, we need that to occur because obviously we need to build out for Cotai. But it really is starting to look to be some strength across the whole gamut. And obviously, if you look at some of the other operators that are maybe more focused on the bottom end of the mass market, they're seeing strength in that market as well. So I just think it seems to be across the board, and we, I think we'll look to seeing that momentum maintain. And that will be very positive for all of us.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And then Jim, Dan. Jim, you kind of talked a little bit about where you stand coming out of the 3Q on the profit growth plan and obviously through the bogey for this year, your exit run rate, are you guys, as you're moving through the process, identifying incremental things? Does the view still pretty much remain the same, that kind of $400 million is the target number, you're just getting there sooner, or do you believe there is the potential to maybe find a little bit more?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, it's hard to express how proud we are internally here because you'd have to see how comprehensive this has become on literally every property. Hundreds of senior executives, thousands of people have bought into it. A project management office of, how many people, Chris, do you have in?","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","15.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","15?","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","In project management.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","In project management, full-time effort; over 500 initiatives. And we have found some that \u2013 only recently that we haven't thought of a year ago. And so, we internally believe that we're always going to find ideas; that we're moving into a mode of continuous improvement here. And so, yes, we're ahead of our schedule in terms of the $400 million, but that doesn't mean that there's going be some finite end date to this program. We're going to continue to work through it and continue to find ways.","And I can assure you, we're operating this business in a more sophisticated, more thoughtful way than has ever been done before in our industry, which leads to other innovations and other ideas. So that's why I'm so incredibly proud of the effort is because I believe not only have we achieved more than we would have imagined, but we've achieved a cultural change in our company that rewards, inspires, innovative improvements, and I'd expect to see more of that in the future.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And, Jim, I would add many of those ideas that we've found will be applicable to Borgata also. And we've already began to line up those ideas.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","That's a good point, Corey. So the Borgata is just becoming part of this process. And there are two elements that we haven't discussed much about Borgata, which will accrue to our collective benefit, one is the programs we can put into place, but also the cross-marketing of Borgata with our East Coast presence.","Imagine the opportunity that we will have to cross-market between Beau Rivage, Borgata, MGM National Harbor and then Springfield, along with Detroit and Tunica. There's a \u2013 we already have a very robust charter program, an M life program on the East Coast, but the addition of Borgata in our database now, which as you recall, had very little overlap between the databases, and the soon-to-be opened MGM National Harbor will have a big impact we think on the revenues on the East Coast.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks, everybody.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Carlo.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody. Jim, on the topic of PGP, the benefits in the 3Q, maybe how have they evolved or are different than the benefits you saw earlier this year and last year in terms of where you're seeing those benefits being sourced?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, I'm going to give that one to Chris Nordling, who's been running the show.","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","Hey, Joseph. In the beginning, we were more revenue-centric in the beginning, and then as we drove through the operations and became more efficient at the operating expense level, we began to get our stride in that area. And now we're about balanced, about where we thought we were going be; one-third revenue, two-thirds expense. And a lot of the ideas took long ramp up. So, as we got into the second half of the year, we instituted a lot of programs that are going be full benefit in 2017, but we're seeing the run rate starting to hit here in the third and fourth quarter.","As Jim mentioned, the process was very comprehensive. This is an idea we had 800 PMO meetings over the course of the last 16 months and 100 steering committee meetings with our senior executives as we drove these initiatives through the organization. So it took a long time to get us up and running, but we're hitting full stride now.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Give them one example, Chris, maybe like zone maintenance or anything that would be a good example why it takes a while to ramp this up.","Christopher W. Nordling - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, zone maintenance would be a perfect idea. We had to go property by property in the operating engineer area, talk to our employee, our union constituents, our operators. We had to have series of meetings on what it is we're going to try to accomplish, line up our sourcing efforts to make sure supplies and equipment was there. And then we'd have to do that 10 properties wide in Las Vegas and then in our regional properties. So just that idea alone took about eight or nine months to get rolled out and get it set up.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. And then, Grant, obviously Macau came in much stronger than we and consensus were modeling. Either Grant or Dan or Cathy, can you run through maybe what the revenue and EBITDA impact was from the high VIP hold? Our method suggests that you may be held high on direct, perhaps. And maybe if you can quantify if at all there was some kind of benefit from collections, just to kind of get to a clean net revenues and a clean EBITDA number, adjusting for those two things? Thank you.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","So, yes, we had a good quarter. Mind you, we've had a couple of not-so-good quarters in the past. And if you look at the quarter, we probably exceeded normalized hold by about $15 million, which would have on an adjusted-margin basis would have brought it down to about just around 29%. In terms of the collection, it's really nothing huge. But we have obviously been able to continue the payment cycles coming through. So there might have been another $1 million roughly in terms of a $1 million, $2 million in terms of collections. So overall, on a regular basis, we're still looking at margins close to that 28.5%, which is where we think we're stabilized. I've always said that our numbers were somewhere in that mid-20s. Does that clarify for you?","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Good work.","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So Jim and team, in the quarter you outpaced RevPAR growth forecast by about 400 basis points. Just wondering what were the surprises that you didn't anticipate and what could surprise you in the fourth quarter?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","You want to start with that, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Sure. Yeah, I think part of it is the market was pretty strong, especially with the convention base that we had. So we were able to leverage our yielding off of that. In addition, I think we're spending a lot more effort on our marketing prowess and we've actually just changed out our marketing company and our buying company and we're really focused on our advertising costs and how we align it with the yield. So we've seen some power on that. And I think we'll be able to benefit in the fourth quarter from that because, as you know, the fourth quarter's going to be a tough comparison. But we still expect to see some growth from that.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","So we've seen \u2013 yeah, so the operational changes Corey's referring to have certainly helped. T-Mobile Arena has absolutely helped. T-Mobile I think was the highest grossing arena in the world.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","In September.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","In September. Can you guys imagine \u2013 can you believe that? Highest grossing arena in the world in September. Off to a great fourth quarter as well. That drives a lot of traffic in that neighborhood. We're opening up the Park Theater on \u2013 what, Bill? September 17?","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","December 17.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","December 17 with Stevie Nicks. So bringing in events drives that. The leisure business has been stronger than we predicted. And we're going to end up this year with a higher convention mix than I think we had predicted. Do you have that number, Dan? I think it's going be...","Unknown Speaker","Over 19%.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Over 19%.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","We'll be over 19% on the convention side, which will be a record. So better convention business. The leisure business, because of the operational improvements Corey had mentioned plus the events that are driving some really good retail stays, and overall improvement in our properties I think are the reasons.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. And then just while we're on the Park Theater, how should we think about Monte Carlo once that opens? Obviously, there's some construction disruption now, but once that stops and then once you have the Park Theater open, how much of an EBITDA lift do you think that property gets?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I think that Monte Carlo is going to be under significant amount of construction over the next three years. The Park Theater in and of itself will help a lot given the lineup of events we have there. I'm looking at Bruno Mars and Cher and Stevie Nicks. It's going be extremely well occupied. That's the good news. The challenge for Monte Carlo is we're literally renovating the property from the inside out and so it won't be one of our best-performing properties over the next couple of years. I think that New York-New York will benefit from this being next door and probably Aria will as well. But I think if I were modeling out Strip properties, I would say that Monte Carlo's the one and the only one that's really going be challenged from a growth perspective given the significant amount of capital we're putting into the property and construction that will be around it.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then with your relationship with MGP, how can we think about the Park Theater? Is it realistic that you could sell that real estate to MGP?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, they're going to have a call in a little over an hour and I would ask them that. One of the concepts that we developed was if we can develop, as an MGM Resorts, capital that generates significant cash flow and we can find a clearing price on an arms-length basis to the REIT, both parties would be interested in pursuing that. We have very, very high hopes and highly confident about the success of the Park Theater given the lineup of performers. And the success the Coliseum has had here for many years and Planet Hollywood. This is not an unknown phenomenon for us or for the market. So I think it would be quite easy to underwrite a level of cash flow and we'll have to see whether or not that that can happen.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to start with Las Vegas, so as we start to cycle the PGP investment and start to enter a little bit more of a normal environment in Vegas, my question is, I think operating expenses, as we look at them, and everybody's going to carve this up a little differently, but as we look at them, they're probably down maybe 3% year-on-year. As we start to move into 2017, could you just give us a ballpark or a sense, do you think operating expenses in Vegas are flat, up or down, as we think about again starting to cycle these tough comps? There's natural inflation in the business, but also you're still coming up with new initiatives.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I'll take a stab at it and I'll be corrected by to the left and then my right. I think that our revenues are going grow in 2017 by virtue of the fact that room revenues we believe will and we believe that the non-gaming amenities that we're adding, whether it's Park Theater or other amenities, will help continue to drive revenue. I think that margins will continue to expand, which means that our expense growth will be more muted than our revenue growth. And I think that comes toward two points. One is some of the higher margin business that we are creating, some this entertainment business, plus some of the residual benefits of what Chris Nordling was talking about earlier.","I think the city will do well next year and we typically do better than the city, that factors into my thinking somewhat. But also recall that there's really no new capacity coming on to this market. We talked about that again in our investor deck. But by having the limited amount of supply we have with room rates that are still below pre-recession peaks and convention business that's growing, and growing for us, that bodes well, I think, to margin growth going into 2017. And I don't know if you guys want to add anything to that.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","I would agree, Jim. Look, we have the cost of living increases, but we're going to offset a lot of that. And our goal is to keep it as flat as possible with labor initiatives that we have that going in place. Really the labor PGP component of our business is just really getting going. So I think you'll see the results of that in next year's numbers.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for that. And then, my follow-up is on Macau. Grant, I think as we look at the performances for the quarter, most people talk about stabilization. You actually mentioned the word strength for maybe the first time. So my question there is, could you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing recently, has what we saw in the late summer continued here into the fourth quarter and any meaningful impact from the Parisian and Wynn openings that's different than what we saw in the third quarter results?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","I think one of the critical points is, is that we've gone through quite a long flat spot or flat cycle. And what I'd say by strength is like everything else in our market, it's about confidence, operational confidence and also consumer confidence. And that's one of the things I would say that we started to see some of coming through this season. Parisian obviously had a very good opening, as we expected them to do, with the sort of mass operation that they were running. And it has obviously given everybody a good indication of the capacity that the market has that it can grow when you put it together.","In terms of impact, say, specifically on the peninsula, the impact from these openings has almost been nonexistent. Historically, there was for the first openings in Cotai, a short-term effect, probably six to eight weeks. This occasion, it hasn't and I guess it's worthy, again, remind ourselves that the peninsula is incredibly resilient. And if you look at the market share that it has relative to the properties that are on the peninsula, we're very excited about being able to offer two very high-class properties in the peninsula and in Cotai. And I think that's what we're going to start seeing coming forward. It is not an issue of saying that everything is in Cotai. I think what we see is that the opportunities are really in all of Macau. And we're really excited about having that sweeps position of being able to offer product in the peninsula, high quality. We continue to drive that business. And as we start to see some growth coming back into the market, that's going to lift us all.","Quite clearly what we all need to be focused on is the intensity of our execution. And I will \u2013 I want to acknowledge the team here that we've continued to do that really in a very solid way. But we've done it in a strategic way because everything, everything we're doing is focused around sustaining and maintaining the capacity of the Macau property, positioning ourselves for Cotai and taking on the \u2013 and taking up the opportunity that having that extra capacity has. It is just so exciting for us to be able to finally have a decent room count where we can really do some serious things about some non-gaming developments and bringing in more entertainment into the city. So, from our perspective, market indicators starting to move as much, pretty well all the capacity other than ourselves. And (35:31) which is probably 18 months further down the track, I think that we're in a really great position and we're very excited about that.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Grant, this is Jim. I'd like to add something if I could, because I just want to brag on Grant a little bit here. We have the best CEO in Macau in Grant Bowie. And we have the most efficient, we have the most sophisticated marketing machine in the Macau market. And you can see that in the results month after month after month where MGM is the market leader in mass on the peninsula and is a leader in win per units on the peninsula. And the peninsula is always going to be an important and relevant market.","There's been some commentary in the past where the business is going to shift from the peninsula to Cotai. That's just not going to happen. That's not the case. The peninsula will always be a very large gaming market. In and of itself, it's larger than all of Las Vegas. And MGM and Wynn are the dominant players on the peninsula. And we like being next to one another. And they both do well and MGM did particularly well this quarter.","And over in Cotai, Dan and Bill Hornbuckle and I, we just got back a couple days ago. I'd like to make a comment about the neighborhood; I think Harry talked about it. First off, Wynn Palace is beautiful. We spent two hours in a tour of Wynn Palace. The execution of the detailing, of the quality, the materials and design is spectacular. And we believe it ultimately will be very successful. As that market grows, it will do well. Obviously, we visited Parisian, too. And it has tapped into the vein of what is currently very popular in Macau and Cotai in particular, in the mass market. We think that's great for Macau. We think it's great for growing the market, and we believe that the Macau market will be up in 2017 versus 2016.","But let's be clear about what we're developing in Cotai. This isn't a project we started yesterday. We've been working on MGM Cotai for three years. We've known that we needed to diversify away from gaming. We knew that we needed to create an entertainment spectacle that is free to the public and that is something they have not ever seen before, and we are. We knew we wanted to bring the DNA of MGM's entertainment to build a theater that does not exist in the world, let alone in Macau; a multi-functional theater that can transition from a major ballroom to an exhibit hall to a theater for sports and entertainment, and into a nightclub.","We also have been working hard on food and beverage. Yes, of course, we're going have high-end restaurants, but we're also tapped into local cuisines with hot pots and regional Chinese food, and we certainly will have food in retail that will be diverse and approachable.","And I think that when we're done and the light rail is completed, it will dramatically benefit Wynn Palace. I'm sorry that we're not open now. It certainly hurts. But we've been there before because when the MGM first opened on the peninsula, we were surrounded by construction, and we knew that hurt. And so we can empathize with the neighborhood today. But it's not long from now where MGM Cotai will be opened next to Wynn, next to City of Dreams, and I would suggest that that's going to be the new epicenter of Cotai, just as the MGM and Wynn is the epicenter of the peninsula.","So, I just want to be clear based on what we've seen in our observations that we're ready, we're prepared for the market as it's growing, and we're going to provide the type of product that we know the customer wants.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much. Congratulations on a great quarter.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Shaun.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DeCree from Union Gaming. Please go ahead with your question.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if I could shift gears for a second, and we're about a month away from National Harbor opening. I wanted to get your thoughts, or at least initial thoughts, on how you're thinking about the early days there. I know reservations have only been being accepted for a while now, but any color you can have on how we should think about the ramp would be helpful.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Man, we're so pumped about it. I don't know if we've ever been more excited. It's crushingly beautiful. It will have and has gotten the kind of buzz that we've not seen in a new resort in quite some time. It's the only happy news in Washington, D.C. It's the only thing that everyone can agree on that National Harbor is going to be a big success. It literally is the talk of that market.","It opens December 8. We have a lineup of entertainment that starts immediately thereafter with Lionel Richie, Duran Duran and a whole bunch of big acts. The restaurants will be ready. The marketing is already in market now. We're getting good feedback from the McCann ad agency that's been doing our marketing. We're having a big party on the 8th. It's a good problem to have in terms of turning people away that we are concerned we're not going have room for everyone that liked to come. The rooms in the market outside of the MGM are all getting booked up.","Remember there's a 2,000-room hotel that Gaylord has. There's a Westin. There's another 1,000 rooms in general. Occupancy rates are rising all around National Harbor. Gaylord itself is building an expansion to its convention center because it anticipates far more demand into the market as a result of MGM National Harbor. So ramp up, yes. There's always a ramp-up in terms of making sure that we have plenty of labor. A lot of cost go into any new opening. And those expenses will start burning off after a quarter or two, but we have extremely high expectations for the amount of customer demand that we're going to get right out of the box when we open on December 8.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Thanks, Jim. That's helpful. And if I could present the same question about Japan. Obviously, there's been heating up interest in Japan and a little bit of commentary that we could see some legislation this year. Just wanted to get your kind of high-level thoughts, to the extent you can give us a little color as to how you're thinking about Japan today?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, also fresh off a plane from there. Bill Hornbuckle and I were there last week. Yes, there's been some very positive commentary around Japan and around the possibility that the Diet would introduce and perhaps pass what they call the Promotion Act. We'll know within the next few weeks if that occurs. And the signs today are favorable that the Promotion Act would be passed. Well, now what does that mean? It means that the bureaucratic machine gets geared into high gear and that the bureaucratic machine works on what's called the Implementation Act and they have a year to do that. In the meantime, Japanese companies, Western and other international companies, will work very hard to try to find the best path forward to present the most compelling RFP for a particular market.","The markets you hear about most often are Osaka, Greater Tokyo, because there are multiple locations there, and Yokohama. Those would be the three large metro markets. There's likely also going be opportunities if this were to pass in some of the smaller regional markets to create a more comprehensive opportunity for Japan. If an operator tells you they have an inside track on a particular market, let's say Osaka, for example, they're wrong. No one has an inside track and no one has been more involved in Japan than we have, although we do see Las Vegas Sands there often, Wynn and many others.","We're highly confident that if this were to happen, it will be done in an extraordinarily transparent, very deliberate way, a uniquely Japanese way and that you'll have plenty opportunities to game theory where integrated resorts could be and who would be able to participate in them. I have high confidence that MGM is going be a front-runner in one of these markets. We're certainly putting in the time and the effort to do that. And the reason why we all are, whether you're from Malaysia, or Australia, or the United States or in Japan, the reason why everyone's spending the time on this is that the potential is absolutely enormous. It would dwarf the Singapore market in size and could be extraordinarily lucrative for all the investors, real estate and operators alike.","So stay tuned. If the Promotion Act is passed, that's a highly, highly positive sign. It means that the machinery of Japan is in motion and that the Implementation Act has a very high chance of being approved, which would mean you'd see RFPs in local jurisdictions starting to develop their own framework and integrated resorts could emerge as early as 2022, 2023, 2024.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Thanks for all the color, Jim, and congratulations again on a great quarter.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. A Macau question and a Vegas question. For Macau, you've talked about opening with just kind of mass tables. And what are your thoughts on another operator in the market had opened with just a strategy for the mass market and is now adding VIP and adding junket tables. Does that affect your thinking about opening without them?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","I think what we need to do is we recognize it's about a ramping up process. I think we're going to be pragmatic and understand how the market builds. The critical point for us is that we obviously are dedicating a lot of time and effort to drive traffic. We're very committed to diversifying the product mix for us in Cotai. And so we understand that we need to deploy all of our \u2013 we need to take advantage of all the opportunities but what we believe is that we need to drive the mass and the premium mass business that we have and then we can take up other opportunities as they occur.","I guess the greatest challenge for us, for all of us in the market at the moment is we're still not seeing really any growth in the junket business. So simply to open junket rooms and dilute the market further and further doesn't seem to be a very strong strategy. But clearly what we're hoping and we are working with our existing operators that we're very comfortable with in Macau and we want to continue to work with them in our peninsula property, as Jim was saying, is to make sure that they're always profitable. And that doesn't necessarily mean just opening rooms for the sake of opening rooms. You've got to open them because there's some performance. We want to work collaboratively, understanding the realities of the market as we see it today. The growth is in the mass. We want to drive the mass and we want to get a very strong footprint in that regard. But we also want to make sure that we continue to work collaboratively with our junket partners, particularly as it applies to the operators that we have in the Macau property.","William Joseph Hornbuckle - MGM Resorts International","And, Robin, this is Bill Hornbuckle. Maybe to add a little more color. Remembering we have a massive international market that we supply with about 200 marketing executives throughout the world. That machine will still be in play. And when we open The Mansion, which is the product that will be unique to Macau like it has been to Las Vegas, that machine will be active. So while the junkets become the criteria on which we will judge for the future, everything else we do, whether it be Macau or back here in Las Vegas, all of that activity will occur from day one.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then for the Vegas question, just to understand a little bit better what drove such strong RevPAR growth in the third quarter. Can you give us color on what the rate increase was in convention business versus the increase from your other cash paying customers, just to try and get a sense of that?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Sure, Robin. This is Dan. Obviously, as you look at our overall results, all of our RevPAR increases at this point in time are really coming from rate side of the equation. We had one of the strongest quarters on the leisure side. I think Corey mentioned earlier, obviously as we continue to maximize our convention footprint and our room base there, that's given us the ability to drive leisure and retail pricing, and so third quarter is one of the highest for the year increases in leisure that we've seen in terms of our overall pricing. So in the third quarter, both convention and leisure were the big drivers for us.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And what I would add, Robin, is the fact that we were able to significantly increase the mix to where the summer was almost like a normal quarter from convention mix. That's allowed us to really yield. We're really replacing the lower end leisure business with that convention business.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. No, that's helpful. Do you think next year's convention mix will be higher than the level you ended up with this year?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","In total? Our goal is, yeah, I think we'll be at least at that level and our goal will be obviously with the in the year, for the year, to kind of push that slightly higher. But the real challenge, Robin, is the peak periods we're pretty much tapped out and maximizing. So now it's just around putting the right business in the right buildings and maximizing the footprint and really driving business into the shoulder periods. So that's why the third quarter is such a great outcome for us. Traditionally, it's never been a strong convention quarter, but you've seen the strategy there over the last couple of years really play itself out to help us drive that business in the third quarter.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And so the mix by the end of the year, Dan, what did we say, 19%?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","This year it will be right around 19%, a little over 19%.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","So 19%. So, Robin, to put that in context, obviously that's a record. We flew back with Mike Dominguez, who is probably listening in, who just won one of the greatest awards you can have in the convention. It's a lifetime achievement award, by the way, in the convention business. He runs our convention business. He told Bill and I that he just signed on a convention customer for five years with another potential five-year extension, a massive Fortune 50 company that will begin next year. And we're able to juggle a lot of stuff around to be able to accomplish that. And I'm sure Mike's going to get a press release on that one out in the next week or two. It's certainly worthy of that.","But the ability to juggle some people around within our facilities, the fact that we are expanding our convention facilities themselves, obviously as you know, with Aria being, coming online with its new convention space and a few other projects that we're looking at to further increase our convention advantage, that's going to help us continue to not only drive rate, but also have greater longer-term visibility, which helps us yield our leisure business better.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Unknown Speaker","We'll take the last question, please? Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just one question for me. So for your domestic U.S. casino revenues, it was up 7%. Last quarter, Jim, you talked about seeing some return in the Far East play into the Vegas market. Can you just parse out the performance between mass and VIP in Vegas or in your domestic properties in the third quarter? Thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure, I'm looking. So looking at the gaming in general, high-end play was up, right, in the quarter in terms of win and that came from the Far East and Korea, primarily. Right, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Mainly Far East, yeah.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Mainly Far East.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Korea was strong, too.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And in terms of non-baccarat play, our market share was about flat versus a year ago. But our shares are pretty high. And our slot play was up a little bit as well. So I think it's primarily some of our unrated play, table game play was up in the quarter. That helped. We saw some real nice increases in blackjack and a few other of our non-international play. Slots were up a little bit and the international based on Far East was also up and that helped us in the quarter. The hold, I think we mentioned in the investor deck in terms of what the hold impact was for the quarter, which was what, was it $30 million or something?","Unknown Speaker","$30 million.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","$30 million in the quarter.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So do you feel good about the overall trajectory of gaming play, both on the VIP and then for mass, going forward?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, we do, because it's event driven and we've got?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","5x the events.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah, so for this year, a bunch going into the fourth quarter, but next year we're going to have five times \u2013 I had to check this because I didn't think it could be right \u2013 but we're going to have five times the number of events in 2017 than we had this year in 2016. And you say, how can you do that? It's \u2013 well because we have the Park Theater open for the entire year. National Harbor is going to have a concert or an event almost every weekend. All the arenas here in Las Vegas are going to have more activity than they had in 2016. So this is a very much an event-driven business and we dominate on the event side. So I think that our national play and in some cases international play will benefit from all the events that we're having in these \u2013 the various facilities we have, which are very powerful.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And I'm hopeful on the domestic side, especially with the East Coast presence, because we really haven't had that up until this year. Even though we own 50% of Borgata, we're not able to access that database. So between that database and National Harbor database, we're hoping to get some cross-marketing play into Vegas.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Thanks, Thomas. And with that being the last question, I thank you all for joining us. And if there's any follow-up questions, we'll be around all day. And I'd like to remind folks that the MGP call, which is their first earnings call, will be at 12:30 Eastern Time here in a few minutes.

Joining the call from the company are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bill Hornbuckle, President; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; James Stewart, CEO of MGM Growth Properties; Grant Bowie, CEO and Executive Director of MGM China Holdings Limited.","Participants are in a listen-only mode. After the company's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please note, this conference is being recorded.","Now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Well, thank you, Keith, and good morning and welcome to the MGM Resorts and MGM Growth Properties' second quarter 2016 earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com and at www.mgmgrowthproperties.com, a lot of Ws. Both MGM and MGP furnished their respective press releases on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions under the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press releases and in the MGM and MGP periodic filings with the SEC.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about MGM and MGP's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in their respective press releases, which are also available on our websites. Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","And before turning it over to Jim, just one housekeeping item, as a result of the MGP transaction, we now refer to what we once called wholly owned domestic resorts as simply domestic resorts and wholly owned Las Vegas Strip resorts as Las Vegas Strip resorts. Any reference to domestic resorts and Las Vegas Strip resorts will continue to exclude CityCenter unless otherwise noted.","I'd also like to remind everybody that our supplemental earnings deck is posted on both our websites which we hope you'll continue to find helpful.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning. When we last spoke to you, I think it was about a month and a half ago, at our first ever Investor Day, one of the key messages we had hoped everyone would take away was the strength and the depth of our talented management team and the transformation they are driving companywide through our Profit Growth Plan.","It's been a year since we launched this plan, and looking back, it has and continues to leave a profound impression on this company. I'm proud that we have not only made tremendous progress to-date, but that the advancements we have made within this organization were achieved through innovation, teamwork and importantly with sustainability and perpetuity in mind.","This plan was the stepping stone to inspiring a culture of continuous improvement here and where the concepts of the Profit Growth Plan are permanently embedded into the core philosophy of MGM. For those on the phone, from MGM, thank you very much for your participation, it's obviously been a tremendous success. We delivered a great quarter.","Our domestic resorts cash flows increased 12% year-over-year, that's five consecutive quarters of double-digit EBITDA growth. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts cash flows increased 13%. EBITDA margins exceeded 30% at both the domestic and our Las Vegas Strip resorts. CityCenter resort operations EBITDA increased 6%. All three of our regional resorts produced record second quarter cash flows amazingly.","Here in Las Vegas, as you already know, we had an extraordinary May last year, that included most notably the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, we also had a couple of major music festivals, and of course it made for really tough second quarter comp.","And despite that our Strip RevPAR grew 3.1%, which I know was below what we had guided, but frankly, in any growth over that quarter last year would have been in our opinion a great improvement and it was, particularly, as we built momentum throughout the June-July period, because that delta was really isolated simply and solely to the month of May.","We had a good April, but even a stronger June and our third quarter is looking really terrific. You may have seen the earnings deck this morning, but have you not, I'm pleased to say we're forecasting our Las Vegas Strip resorts' RevPAR to grow by 7% in the third quarter. This we believe is an indication of the continued strength of Las Vegas markets certainly doing better than U.S. as a whole, and of course we're responsible for over 40,000 of the rooms here.","The important thing is that our underlying business remains strong and the market here remains very healthy. I'm really happy to say we just finished July and I can tell you we are off to a great start here in the third quarter. We had our best July ever in our domestic resorts in terms of adjusted property cash flow. And we've seen broad-based strength across all of our business segments. We are also encouraged by the early indications of activity that we are picking up back from our Far East business. We're hosting some folks from the Far East, over the last several weeks, some of which we haven't seen in a while and others we've never seen before.","Our leisure and convention group business continues to be strong. As a reminder, that's where the bulk of this city's hotel business lies. In the third quarter alone, we already have on the books, for MGM Resorts, 150,000 incremental convention room nights versus last year. This has, historically, as you know, been a shoulder period for group business and our sales team's efforts obviously are paying off. We're going to have the strongest convention mix in the third quarter in our history.","The fourth quarter is going to be another tough comp. Remember that last year, we grew RevPAR at 12%, but because of the strength here in the third quarter and because of the bookings we are seeing, we still feel very strong for the rest of the year, and as we'll get into 2017 is also pacing well and remember, CON\/AGG is returning in the first quarter. Of course, we continue to execute on our Profit Growth Plan.","Remember during the Investor Day, we increased our Profit Growth Plan target to $400 million from the previous target of $300 million and I am very pleased to report that we are tracking well against this increased target.","In the second quarter, we achieved $73 million of incremental EBITDA as a part of that plan and that includes contributions from our 50% economic share of CityCenter. And at the Investor Day, you heard straight from the men and women that are leading this effort to optimize our business across all the segments. And I heard a lot of feedback from you all, talking about the depth and strength of our management team, of which we are very proud.","This effort is bearing fruit, and we remain committed to exceeding 30% full year EBITDA margins by 2017. Obviously, the numbers speak for themselves here, we're clearly proving out our ability to achieve this goal. Over in Macau, MGM China's cash flows, pre the license fee, grew quarter-to-quarter by 4%. And that was lead by growth in the premium mass segment.","Despite lower hold in both mass and VIP, adjusted EBITDA margins remained healthy due to the strength in the mass and our continued cost efficiency efforts, led ably by Grant and his team there. And as you know, Grant will be available for any questions, but as I'm speaking, I could say that we continue to see very positive signs of health in that mass market, led by the premium mass. We believe that's the segment of the market that we focus on, and that has stabilized.","We're entering into the final stages of our construction of MGM Cotai. We've been working really well and closely with our contractor, China State Construction, to get this one over the finish line. We are going to be absolutely sure we make this resort the best it possibly can be, and it will meet our high standards and the high standards of China State. We're going to get it right the first time.","And working with China State, we now have great clarity as to exactly when we can open, and as a result of that, we have decided to push out the opening date a bit for MGM Cotai into the second quarter of next year. Recall that we'd said, we are looking for March. This will give us just a little bit more time. It does increase the budget slightly by 1% to $3.1 billion, but we think the time is worth it and both MGM and China State are committed and working well toward that timeframe.","Grant could speak to it, but we're really excited about what exactly would be MGM Cotai, what it will look like, and how it will feel from a standpoint of technology and entertainment offerings. We know it will bring first-in-class, first-in-market in many of these offerings, and as we get closer to the opening, we'll be announcing many of those very unique amenities.","And finally, our newest child, MGM Growth Properties. We have, of course, James Stewart here. MGP had its very first report since its IPO in April, and James is going to speak to the quarter. I got to say that James and the team are off to a running start over the last few months. Congratulations, James, on the acquisition of Borgata. You own a bouncing baby Borgata, and that just closed a couple of days ago. We think that starting next quarter, James and his team will host a separate call for MGP, and so what we'll likely do, starting next quarter, is MGM will have a call, and then back-to-back, with an MGP call, so as to give investors an opportunity to talk more in-depth to both companies. But for now, we're together, and so, I'll hand it over to James Stewart.","James C. Stewart - Chief Executive Officer, MGM Growth Properties LLC","Thank you, Jim. First, I would like to officially welcome all of our new investors to the MGP family. A few months ago in April, MGM Growth Properties completed its IPO, issuing 57.5 million shares at $21 a share, the top of the price range. This includes 7.5 million shares issued as part of the greenshoe and was the largest triple-net REIT IPO of all time. It was a fantastic transaction and I couldn't be more proud and thankful for all the hard work of the many people involved in achieving this highly successful outcome.","After completion of the IPO, the team went to work immediately, and just a month later, announced the acquisition of the real property of the Borgata, which as Jim mentioned, closed on Monday. With this transaction, we've added another premier asset to our portfolio and increased our rent by $100 million to $650 million on an annual basis.","Pro forma for the acquisition, our net leverage remains within our target range of five times to 5.5 times EBITDA, and we expect the deal to be accretive to AFFO. As a result of this accretion, we will announce an increase in our annual dividend of $0.12 a share, starting in the third quarter, which we're all very excited about. We look forward to continuing to grow profitably and to becoming one of the leading publicly-traded REITs in the United States.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, James, and before we get into Q&A, just a couple of added points. I want to emphasize that we're well on pace with this aggressive plan on profitability and our long-term financial strength. We obviously have a tremendous portfolio and that is growing with the addition of Borgata and we're excited to invite and add the 6,000 new employees to the MGM Resorts family, literally this week.","But we're growing beyond that as well. As you know, we're opening National Harbor at the end of this year, Springfield in a couple of years. And we do know that beyond just creating economic benefit for those local communities which is significant, it also cements our position as the clear and dominant leader in these markets as we integrate those new properties into our family.","We've been working really hard on the balance sheet. We have made tremendous strides there. We are committed to be once again an investment-grade company and we're marching towards that goal and as we become that, as we develop more and more free cash flow and cash from our dividend-paying enterprises, we are expecting that over time we'll be able to return that cash as well to our shareholders.","MGM is not just a holding company, or even a gaming company, it's not even a hospitality company. The fact is we operate at the very intersection of hospitality of art, of dinning, shopping, gaming, live entertainment. We create amazing entertainment experiences for guests from every walk of life.","We are the first movers on many fronts, both in the way we build and the way we run our business, both in terms of the leadership, and the fact that people want to work for us and our deep commitment to the responsibility of corporate, social good, and our communities.","It's really a great time to be a part of MGM and we look forward to sharing more with our owners, our stakeholders in the future as we continue to grow, continue to improve, and continue to make money, return value to the owners of MGM, our shareholders.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Jim, you spoke a little bit about, obviously, the tough comparison in the fourth quarter and noted that you feel pretty good about it and then some incremental strength in 2017. Would you be able to maybe put some framework, A, around the 2017 comment, talk a little bit about the group booking pace, convention mix, et cetera, as well as possibly put some color around the fourth quarter and how that's shaping up right now all relative to kind of the 6% RevPAR for the year?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, I'll give a start and then anyone can jump in. So, first, yes, I think we pleasantly surprised people in terms of our RevPAR guidance for the current quarter, 7%. We feel very comfortable with that number. We are certainly well ahead of that already. We had a double-digit increase just in the month of July alone. And a lot of it has to do with this group business that we are seeing in the current quarter, but we think will continue into the fourth quarter. I think, our all-time record room mix in the third quarter is about 14%. This year, it'd be like 18%, which is really a tremendous achievement on the group side. A lot of that will carry over into the fourth quarter, but as we said, the comp is difficult in the fourth quarter. It really will depend on the continuation of the sales teams efforts for the in the year, for the year. And we've seen a lot of recent business activity that's being booked, even as short-term as in a couple of weeks, let alone in the fourth quarter. So, we think on RevPAR, we'll be up in the fourth quarter. We are not prepared to give a number against that 12% comp, but we think it will be a healthy increase.","As it gets into next year, again, we think we're going to have a record in terms of our group business. I don't think we had more in the year, for the year for next year, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","Yes, we're up about 8% in case of our group room nights year-over-year at the same time.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, did you hear that? We're up...","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, yes.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. And so, I got to believe that we're going to do better on the group side in 2017 than we are this year, and we're having a good year this year. In addition, recall, that we open up The Park Theater at the end of this year. If we've learned anything about Las Vegas and how different it is from the rest of the United States, is that special events and entertainment activity drives RevPAR growth and the very fact that we had two Rock in Rio concerts, and the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight to compete against showed you the difficulty in the second quarter. Once we open Park MGM Theater, that opens in December, we'll have a lot more business and entertainment activity that quarter and \u2013 I'm sorry, that year, and of course also with our entertainment events at T-Mobile and MGM and Mandalay.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then, Grant, if you're available, would you be able to comment a little bit obviously that the mass side seems to certainly be stabilizing and that's showing up in the numbers, on kind of July-to-date if you're seeing any...","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","No.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...change in trend from your 2Q levels?","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","Actually, July was very, very solid, continue to show that strengthening. And I think the critical point is that, it's also deepening in terms of the quality of the customer and the new signups in the performance, and that's I guess, what's really pleasing to us is, we're seeing returning frequency of non-customers, but we're starting to see some significant incremental new customers coming into the mix, so that's really a good sign.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Just one moment.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hello? Joe, are you there?","Operator","Okay. I'm sorry. And the next question comes from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good morning. Let me, Corey, just ask you a follow-up question on the update percent pace for next year. If you back out ConAgra, which only comes in every three years, what do you think that pace might look like?","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. I think we'd still be up, Harry, because a lot of the \u2013 the way the ConAgra and the citywide is booked, not all the rooms are necessarily on the books right now. So, I don't have those numbers in front of me, but I feel pretty comfortable that we'd be up still.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And then, Jim, a follow-up question on the cash flow. You had mentioned that you're beginning to generate free cash flow and if you could give us a little bit more color on how much free cash flow you expect to generate in the second half, where is that likely to be directed, and then how that changes in the first half once National Harbor opens? I am just trying to get a better feel for what you'd do with your free cash flow now and what you'll likely do with it in 2017?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll give you what I can, Harry. Yes, we're spending money today, building National Harbor, Cotai, obviously and a big project here in Las Vegas is that Park Theatre, which opens up in December. But yet still we're throwing off free cash.","Once we get into 2017, we get a big boost from the opening of National Harbor, the completion and cash flow generation of The Park Theatre. And then, of course, we have the opening of Cotai. It's our expectation at MGM Resorts that our operating free cash flow will accelerate. And on top of that acceleration, we'll be accelerating our ability to dividend back to MGM Resorts through our joint ventures, like CityCenter and our investments in MGM China, post the opening of Cotai.","And as that occurs, our leverage declines. The rating agencies have already indicated that they have increased our ratings several times. And as we continue to improve our ratings, you'll see a higher degree of receptivity at MGM to start dividending money back to its shareholders. So, I would guess, as we approach investment-grade, you'll be hearing more from us about what'd we do with our excess cash, and our inclination at this point in time is to establish a regular dividend, when it's appropriate and dividending money back to the owners of MGM Resorts, as we are today with MGM China and MGP.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","That's helpful. And then, I have one quick one for Grant. This morning, we heard from MPEL that they're encouraged also by the trends in mass. Although, what was interesting is that their mass at City of Dreams was down sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter. And you seem to be to have held up better, and if you could give us some color on the dynamics of why some operators are just simply outperforming in Macau?","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","I guess, I'll just focus on ourselves, because I think that's probably the one I know best about. I guess from our perspective is that we just really and continued and being focused for a long time, Harry, on understanding that it's about the way we manage the metrics and the way we actually work the database. And I think it's about maintaining the relationship, maintaining the service levels and ensuring that you continue to offer something. It's not just about the gaming. We're very, very aware and as you heard earlier from Jim, we're a leader in all facets of our business and that's absolutely true here in Macau as we diversify. It's one thing to keep on adding these non-gaming facilities, but they're actually going to be adding to the overall experience for our customers and I think that's what we're really being able to do.","The recruitment and the signups and the retention of our customers, has always been our focus. We've always been really strong with that and we've retained those customers, we maintain relationships with them and despite the fact that there may be new products and new offers coming into the marketplace, they've chosen to stay with us because of the overall package that we're providing. We know that's critical for us moving into Cotai and it's about now building the base and deepening the market segmentation as I said earlier, and we're starting to see some of that positive indicators.","I think all the operators in Macau are chasing the same business, but I think, we've worked really hard over many years now to put the systems in place to sustain ourselves. As the smallest in the market, we just have to do everything better, harder and faster than anybody else and I'm really proud of the team for that.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, everybody.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","Harry, one other quick follow-up, excluding the first quarter, we're up 5% in pace for 2017, so that's another way to look at it.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Corey.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","The way things look now.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you guys hear me now?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we can, Joe.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hey, Joe. Welcome back.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, again. Jim, in your prepared remarks, when you were talking about the strength that you saw in July, I think, you used the word, best July ever, record cash flows. Within that, you talked about strength in the Far East, customers coming into Las Vegas, I believe that's how I interpreted your comments. And you've obviously talked about double-digit RevPAR growth in July. Can you talk about how broad-based that consumer spend is outside of the room? And if you can maybe amplify the comments about the Far East business as well, that's intriguing to us. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. It's been a really remarkable summer out here, Joe. We haven't seen this level of activity, in terms of people in the resorts, up and down the Strip ever. And I've heard some ideas, why that might be? People are travelling more to U.S. destinations like Las Vegas, there's a lot of activity here. But the fact is that, up and down our 10 resorts here, we're seeing more consumer activities than we've ever seen in a summer. And that has resulted in a very good spending across the entire portfolio of what we have to offer, food and beverage, entertainment, hotel and gaming.","So that has driven a really remarkable month and so far a really good quarter in RevPAR. Layered on top of that and equally significantly I think is the fact that we are seeing a resurgence in high-end gaming business to Las Vegas, during a time when it's a non-traditional time to see these customers, and we saw a lot of customers coming from Asia, both Mainland China, and a variety of other markets in the Far East, coming to Las Vegas. We've had great gaming volumes throughout the quarter and as I said, some of these customers we didn't even know and others we haven't seen in a number of years and we've asked some of them, the ones, we do know well, what's up and they were like, they have said, look, we are on the road, we want to spend time, we want to have fun, and there has been somewhat of a pent-up, I think, level of demand.","I got to say this, we happen to be hosting this conference at Bellagio. Bellagio opened up in October of 1998, Tim?","Unknown Speaker","Yes.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Bellagio just had the best EBITDA month it has ever had in the month of July. So we are seeing incredibly strong numbers on the gaming side at our high-end properties, incredibly strong for given the time of year that we are in, and we are seeing broad-based growth in our mass, I guess you'd call it our retail business. And I think it's significant to note, because some of the hotel companies have struggled a little bit with their transient business activity. We don't have a lot of that. We have very little. And so, our business activity is primarily convention business. And the convention business is doing extremely well for us here in the market in Las Vegas.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, I've a follow-up for James Stewart. I don't want him to feel ignored on this call. But, James, maybe you can talk a little bit about your acquisition pipeline? How fertile that is, any progress you're making, both with respect to MGM and non-MGM real estate? And that's all from me. Thanks.","James C. Stewart - Chief Executive Officer, MGM Growth Properties LLC","Sure. So, we are actively involved in a number of different dialogues. I think they are very interesting, people seem receptive and we're working hard to move them forward.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. I guess, Jim, could you just talk maybe about National Harbor, kind of the timing? Remind us the opening? And how do we think about, ultimately, MGM's decision to potentially sell that asset and drop it into the REIT?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, the development is quite spectacular. There are a few pictures that we've put on the Investor deck. Those are even out of date. We already now have the Marquee has been almost fully encased, that's at the front of the resort. And Whiting-Turner is our general contractor there. They're doing a tremendous job, some of the best work, finished work we've ever seen in a resort. So inside and out, it's quite spectacular. We're right on pace and we will open up in December. Most of the finished goods are already going in, they are literally placing slot machines on the floor already, the carpeting is down, the ceiling treatments are done, the entertainment venue is going to be really spectacular, that's completely enclosed, they are energizing the building, all the glazing is in, they're not only drywalling, but painting all the guest rooms, and it really is quite spectacular.","It will open up, as I said, in December with quite a lineup of entertainment similar to what we did at T-Mobile, where we hit the market with kind of a splash, with a lot of great entertainment out here. And we're going to do the same thing, and we're going to make sure that the people in the Mid-Atlantic region know exactly what it's all about to be a part of an MGM Resorts' property, and what they have been missing all these years with the mediocre casinos that they have been going to for so many years.","Now, what happens with MGP, the great success of Borgata, I think is a very illustrative example here, Steve. And we worked on acquiring, putting together that transaction, worked back to back with James Stewart on coming up with what both companies believe was a fair valuation and it obviously is working out terrifically well at Borgata. We'd like to build upon that success, really as soon as it is logical.","So, I would say that my guess is that either James calls me or I call James, sometime in the middle of next year, once we have a quarter or two quarters under our belt, we can underwrite what it is. We think that MGM National Harbor is cash flowing. And I could tell you from an MGM Resorts' perspective, we're highly motivated to contract with MGP on a transaction very similar to what we did with Borgata.","Steve Sakwa - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Jim, you laid out a bunch of times why you're so optimistic about your group business for the next few years and the (33:42) look really strong. And it's also really noteworthy how much your business contrasts with what we're seeing from the lodging companies, where group pace is up next year, but slowing. In some companies, we've even seen group cancellations. So, while you laid out the drivers for group in Vegas, like entertainment. I'm just wondering if you think this broader lodging kind of slowdown that we're seeing could be a leading indicator and also are you seeing any group cancellations at all?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'll start that and then turn over to folks here. I noted that a lot of the RevPAR guidance in the hotel-only sector has come down a bit, and it's attributed to a slowdown in GDP. And the commentary I've read from you and your compatriots is that, that business activity \u2013 the transient business activity have slowed down. We haven't seen that nor do we get much of it anyway. So, even if that were to be occurring, we haven't seen that. Now, on the group side we've seen little to no change in attrition at all.","So, I'll turn it over to Corey, if you have some views on whether or not that what you're seeing in the hotel sector is a leading indicator to us, I don't know. It doesn't appear to be the case since we continue to build business from other markets and expand the conventions that are already coming.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","Our group business is solid and majority of it continues to be in corporate. We're close to 60% of our business being corporate. And what's different is, there are 1,000 plus groups, very strong in this, particularly (35:35) financial are our main groups. There have been small cancellations, but we've been able to offset them with in the year, for the year bookings.","So, we've been reading the same material, we just don't see it. We feel pretty comfortable when we talk to our sales people constantly just to get a barometer on their \u2013 they continue to increase their bookings, so that's what we're seeing here.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And, Felicia, I would just add a couple of points, so I think, one is and you will know better than I, but I think one is, some of the hotel companies are sector-specific in certain markets, that's really impacting them. And energy is a good example. We don't do much in the energy business. We have very little, if not nil, in energy. So, as Corey pointed out, the sectors where our bread and butter are thriving and doing well right now, and that's benefiting us. The second factor I'd point out is the markets that are starting to slow are starting to have significant supply, and we don't have any supply coming on here in Las Vegas.","So, as people want to be in our properties, and want to be here in Las Vegas Strip, whether with us or our competitors because of what we offer, there's not a supply issue here to be dealing with and that's helping us bolster the shoulder periods that Jim spoke about earlier.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's really helpful and I agree. Now, on the flip side, and this might be early to see this and this might be too creative of a question, but I'm just wondering if you think you could benefit or if you're seeing any benefit from Zika at all as people might not want to travel to places like Miami or just altering their travel in particular? And then also I apologize if you said this, but what is your visibility into 2018 with group?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. One of the interesting notes I got this week was comments from JetBlue that they're seeing a pickup in passenger activity to Las Vegas and maybe a slowdown to Florida. JetBlue is not a large airline here in Las Vegas, I think, it's about 3%, is that right?","Unknown Speaker","Yes.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","3% or so of the lift here. But there is no doubt that there \u2013 I have to believe there are variety of factors as to why Las Vegas is seeing a strong air activity and we're seeing strong drive in activity from the Southwest. And that really is helping everybody in town, not just the MGM portfolio but everyone else. So as sad as that situation is in Florida, I certainly don't want to benefit from it as a result of that, but I can say that we're seeing a pickup in air traffic and in driving traffic even in the last couple of months.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","Even on 2018, we're really comfortable where we are from a pace perspective. We're actually a little bit down from the same time last year, but to a point where we're actually comfortable what's on the books right now, really it's one-year to two-year booking period. When you look at 2018, 2019, in total, we're actually up in those years. So I think, long-term, we're pretty comfortable what we're seeing on the book.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And just, Grant, quick question for you. I was just wondering, did Wynn's comments about their table allocation change how you're thinking about the table allocation at your properties at all?","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","I think the critical point is, is that we're in conversations and we'll continue to be with the government, and I think, we are working hard to make sure that we put everything in place and meet all of their requirements and objectives and therefore, we are still positive and we are still confident that we can deliver the outcomes that we are looking for. But I think it's premature for us to stop talking, we've got a lot of things to do and got a lot of hurdles to jump, but we are pretty positive that we have put all the right steps and all the right components in place.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you, Felicia.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, can you help us think about the seasonality of the Profit Growth Plan? You've realized $140 million of savings in the first half of the year and your goal for the year is $275 million, so I just want post those numbers. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll pass it over to Chris Nordling, who is running the whole thing.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Hey, Chris.","Chris Nordling - President Corporate Entities, MGM Resorts International","Hey.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. As a shareholder, thank you, Chris.","Chris Nordling - President Corporate Entities, MGM Resorts International","Very welcome, and there is more to come. As we get into the third quarter and fourth quarter, you're going to see the comparison of the growth slowdown, because we're going to be comparing savings against last year. Our original goal was $300 million against the baseline of 2014. You will see that continue to grow in the third quarter and fourth quarter and then in the first quarter of 2017.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, hey, Grant, could you put your phone on mute? Well, I think we are getting some feedback.","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","We are on mute.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, well. It's coming from somewhere else then. I'm sorry, okay. Does that answer your question, Thomas?","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","It does, it does. And then when I think \u2013 just on the Borgata, I know you just closed on the deal, but any incremental thoughts on potential upside, now that you own it and then any thoughts on having to invest some lobbying dollars for the North New Jersey referendum. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. We have the Borgata team here. They've been here a last couple of days, working on marketing integration within MGM Resorts. There are multiple opportunities to drive revenue at Borgata, both in terms of the intersection of our database. This was remarkable to me, I don't know if \u2013 I know, we were all surprised a bit, when we took together the MGM database and the Borgata database, there was only a 5% overlap between those two large databases.","So, we have a tremendous amount of incremental data of people that live in the Borgata region that will now benefit from MGM's ownership of Borgata and the same will be true for the Borgatic customer base, being able to go to Beau Rivage in Detroit, and out here in Las Vegas. So that's one area.","The second area is we have a very robust charter air business in our regional properties, as does Borgata. And we do know that there is a lot of opportunity to integrate our charter business to drive more revenue. Third, would be on entertainment. It obviously is the market and entertainment leader, but with our contacts and relationships we can drive more entertainment which thus drives more gaming revenue and overall revenue.","So, we see a tremendous a job as Borgata has done. We see upside in terms of revenue and certainly upside in terms of cost reductions as they come on to larger platforms. And I think that, that is something that we are most gratified about.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","And the other thing I would add, we will take our PGP initiatives and we've already actually given them to them. And some of those of our initiatives will be implemented also. And talking to the Borgata guys, because they've been here, this is the one tool they've been missing in their mind was in order to compete \u2013 I mean, they compete well obviously in Atlantic City, but can compete against Caesars, they never had that Las Vegas presence. And so they really needed this as a huge tool for them.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. And then in terms of the referendum, we've been on the sidelines on this. Our challenge is though we would certainly be the leading contender to win one of those potential $1 billion resort opportunities in North New Jersey, given our presence in New Jersey already, our licensing there and the dominance that Borgata has, we would be no doubt the lead horse. The issue for us is, we don't know enough, we don't know what the tax rate would be, we don't know what the enabling legislation would look like. And it's really the referendum challenge for us as it puts the cart before the horse, we don't have enough facts right now.","We are taking a look at it though and looking at how does that potential fit within the strategic goals of MGM Resorts going forward? We're going to have an unbelievable resort in the D.C. area with National Harbor. We've got our Mississippi Gulf Coast property. Now, we have the dominant position in Atlantic City and soon to have a very successful casino in Western Mass. How does Northern New Jersey or other parts of the region, for example, New York State, fit within the growth plans of MGM? And frankly, we haven't made that determination yet. The referendum is going to be close. I couldn't pick it right now, it's polling to fail currently, but who knows, what happens in November, and we're going to evaluate this and probably make a decision of whether we're positive, neutral or negative within the next few weeks.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe I just wanted to start with the gaming side, I mean, Jim, you made a lot of positive commentary about what you are seeing on the high end side. Was wondering, so far in July, at least, but as we look back over the last \u2013 let's call it six months to 12 months to 24 months, gaming has kind of continued to lag a little bit of what we might consider a normal growth rate. So, I'm kind of curious for your thoughts of excluding the volatility around high end. What do you think the core sort of run rate, slot and table game trajectory for revenue growth is in the market right now?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think a lot of what you've seen has been an evolution of how operators are developing game relationships with customers both on the table side and on the slot side to find ways to not only drive some revenue, but more importantly drive profitability. And for example our table games margins are probably the highest in the industry because we have been focusing on at least at our luxury properties. We've been focusing on table profitability and margin. The same would be true on the slot side, where we have been more thoughtful in terms of how to develop a slot product that results in better profitability for us. I think underlying trends and, Corey or Dan, correct me, if I'm wrong, it's a low single-digit type of growth here in the market. You get the fluctuations withhold obviously and also events. But I think the underlying business, setting aside, this really fortunate experience in the last month or so of high-end business, setting aside that.","Just looking at the core business, of core table and slot performance, we would expect to see low single-digit growth in the market and MGM should do at least as well as that, we would expect better, because we expect a lot of ourselves, and because we are investing a lot in entertainment, which drives a lot of that entertainment \u2013 drives a lot of that gaming revenue.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But I guess, is it fair to say that, at the moment, given some of the mix changes you guys are implementing probably as part of the PGP, that you're sacrificing a little bit of top line for bottom line, the way that works, because I imagine players sense, when odds move, at least from your more kind of regular players can sense when odds move and maybe tweak their play accordingly?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. That would be fair.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","And what I would add, I mean there's some players that we may not want to deal to anymore.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Corey I. Sanders - Chief Operating Officer","They may win a little bit, but between their cost structure and everything and they may drive a lot of volume, we would probably change the way we deal with those customers.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. We disinvited quite a few customers of that nature, but to be clear on this point is that, what it's resulted in for the vast majority of our customers is a far better experience, they're being recognized in a more wholesome way for their play. What it has done is, it has discouraged some of the lower margin players that are professional from playing with us and encouraged the recreational gamer to play and get compensated and rewarded for their play.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's great. Very clear. And my second question would be for Grant, over Macau, but could you just remind us of, how much labor do you think you're holding on to at the moment probably in head count terms that you think can move or transition over to Cotai when you open? That would be really helpful for modeling.","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","We're still going through the details of that as we keep on adjusting, but we're in the numbers of about 500 to 550.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The extra table count \u2013 or, sorry extra head count?","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","Of head count that we're carrying at the moment particularly in table games that will move to Cotai. Yes.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And then just your overall staffing level at Macau and Cotai if you could?","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","So, for the current property, we're just sitting at about 5,800 and in the first phase for Cotai, because we'll be gearing up over a period of time, it's basically a similar number.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. For your RevPAR guidance for Vegas, are you still guiding to full year at that plus 6%? That would kind of imply Q4 being up around 6% or 7%, which I think it sounded like you're thinking maybe \u2013 you're putting a number yet that would be positive, but maybe not as high as that level, so just trying to think about how full your RevPAR shapes up in Vegas?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yes, I think, Robin, for the full year or kind of just the way the math works with the second quarter is kind of around that 5% to 6% level for the full year.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And it doesn't change our view on the back half, it's just the way the second quarter falls out.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. We'll be clarifying that when we get a little bit further in, but with 7%, we'll see how we do. If we'd see 7%, then we still got a good shot at that for the full year. If we come in at 7%, it's going to be tough to make the full year guidance because of the hole we had in May.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then, I don't know if you would give kind of RevPAR by month in Q2, just as it sounds like it was, May was very different than April and June, just to get a sense of what those two months look like?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yes, I think the only thing I would say, I don't want to get into monthly, but both April and June were up nicely and May was just down, and down a little bit more than our expectations that May would have been down, and it's all around that weekend around the fight.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. June was up double digits.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Yes.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","June was up double digits, I can't remember what April was up, but...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","It's pretty close to double digits.","Unknown Speaker","Close to the double digits.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So, it really was the May over May. So, we had a really good June. Obviously, we've talked about how strong July was.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then, my last question is just for Macau, and looking at table allocations, and I know it's too early to know what they may be. But can you quantify how many tables you have banked at The Peninsula? In other words, how many you have that could be moved over to Cotai, if your initial allocation isn't as high as you might like?","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","I wouldn't say that we've banked any tables, but in terms of maximizing the utilization, we're probably in the order of 100, 150.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","I'm sorry, 100 to 150 in (53:10).","Grant R. Bowie - Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, MGM China Holdings Ltd.","(53:10) depending on we could move capacity because we still have some utilization that we can build here, but we're actually trying to find more locations to put more tables on that floor, and so we continue to do that. But if we have to be reallocating tables, we could probably do that.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you, Robin.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from John DeCree from Union Gaming.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Hey, everyone. Thank you for the questions. Great color so far. So just wanted to maybe, Dan, ask for a couple of housekeeping items. I was wondering, if you could let us know how much is left to spend on Cotai and National Harbor for the rest of the year? And then maybe a little bit more detail about the NV Energy exit expense and what you're thinking about kind of saving on a run rate basis from there?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Sure, John. In National Harbor, we'll spend about $450 million through the back half of 2016, and the total remaining is about $550 million, so we'll have about a $100 million tail into early 2017. In Cotai, we're just shy of about the half way point and as far as our spend to-date, we'll spend about another $900 million in 2016, with the remainder obviously in 2017. And then Springfield has started its demo and site and garage, parking work. We'll spend about $100 million in Springfield in the back half of this year.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","NV Energy?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Oh, and then on the NV Energy front, as we've talked about previously and it has been published, we have notified the PUC and Nevada Energy that we will leave the grid effective October 1. The third quarter, we will incur a couple of charges with respect to leaving the grid in totality the range from about $160 million to $190 million. There's two components. There is the impact fee for leaving the system, that's about $87 million. And then, as we paid today, and as we will continue to pay going forward, there will be a second charge for an accrual for some non-bypassable rate charges. That will be about another $70 million to $100 million charge in the third quarter.","Those relate to charges from the time period of today going forward to contracts that exist through 2040. And that we'll accrue upfront. So once we have the charges behind us, we believe that we'll probably save on a go forward basis of the P&L kind of $20 million to $30 million annually and really control our destiny in terms of open market purchases and moving more of our energy to sustainable efforts and really take control of that overall process for ourselves.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Great, thank you. Very helpful.","Unknown Speaker","And, Keith, we'll take our last question.","Operator","Yes. Thank you. And our last question comes from David Katz with Telsey Group.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Hi, good morning. Made it under the wire. I just wanted to ask, when and this maybe a little bit early days, but you talked about your free cash flow ramping up and sort of you talked about dividends, and I was curious how you thought about the determination between dividends versus share repurchases and are they both on the table or would there be some reason to choose, I think, you mentioned dividends but not repurchases?","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I did, David. This is Jim. This of course would be fully discussed, debated, vetted by the board. So I'm just sharing with you my view is at this point in time. I've been here 19 years, we've done both. We've bought back a lot of stock, we've paid special dividends, we've paid an annual dividend and it's my bias toward a regular dividend, because I'd like to establish a recurring disciplined approach toward returning cash to shareholders. But I might get voted by Dan and the board might \u2013 we'll talk about it.","So, my inclination is, and our emphasis at MGM is to continue to improve our balance sheet, continue to show demonstrable progress to the rating agencies, continue to see a path to investment-grade which we think is within our grasp. And as that occurs, we develop additional discipline of developing a plan of returning cash to shareholders. It may result in share repurchases, it may be special dividends, but my inclination at this point in time knowing what I know about our business and this industry would be to establish and perpetuate a regular quarterly dividend.","David Katz - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Right. Both would be fine too, but I appreciate the answer. Thanks very much.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","Thank you, David.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP","And thank you all for joining us this morning. We're obviously around both at the MGM and the MGP offices to answer any follow-up questions and we greatly appreciate you joining us this morning. Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings, Limited. [Operator Instructions] Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and a replay of the complete call will be made available on the company's website. This morning, we furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC as well and can be found on their website.","Before turning it over to Jim, on this call, we'll make some forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website. Finally, please note that this call is being recorded. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Jim Murren.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Also here, we have Bill Hornbuckle, our President; and Corey Sanders, the COO, in case Dan and I will get the tough questions, so Dan -- Bobby Baldwin's on the road. He's out in Asia. We're opening some customers, so everyone wish him luck.","We reported what we believe to be a very strong third quarter. Our EBITDA was up 24%, led by MGM China, and that cash flow was up 25%. Our wholly-owned Strip properties were up 12% year-over-year on budget and improved operations at CityCenter, we're happy to say. We're showing consistency in our wholly-owned operations, as this was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year Strip growth for us and also margin improvement.","As many of you know, we've been targeting investing in our resorts here in Las Vegas, and I'm happy to say, we're seeing good returns on those investments. The MGM Grand and Bellagio room remodels, for example, were completed last year, and clearly, they've been successful in driving profitability at those properties. In the third quarter, Mandalay Bay benefited from recent capital there and significantly improved its nightclub, restaurant and entertainment offerings. And Mandalay's EBITDA grew 20% in the quarter, thanks in part to those initiatives.","And as part of that, our focus now shifts to projects underway at New York, New York and Monte Carlo. For those of you who've been out here lately you'll see quite a bit of construction around those 2 resorts. All of that effort will be opened in the spring of next year. And those properties will benefit from what we believe to be literally a transformation of their Strip fronts, making it very easily accessible, adding casual bars, restaurants and retail. And that's important to us, as we develop West between those 2 properties in a parklike environment with more retail, leading up to a beautiful new arena that we're building with AEG.","M life continues to mature as a program. In fact, the new mlife.com website, which was only recently launched, it was launched in February, is now the highest room-revenue-producing website within our business. This has allowed our customers to see our total breadth of offerings, rather than logging onto one website or another. And that has led to good cross marketing for all of our properties. MyVEGAS, our social game on Facebook, will go mobile next week with its own app. This is becoming an extremely interesting customer acquisition tool for us, and we think it's going to further increase, enhance our M life database.","Grant will touch on this more in a moment, but MGM Cotai construction is progressing really well. We're on pace to complete our piling and site work by the end of this year, and at that point, we're going to move on to the basement and tower construction. And we've added another person to our design team, a leading international designer, Jacques Garcia. He is responsible for designing our Mansion product. He's done some of the most beautiful hotels in the world, and he's a good addition to the team at MGM Cotai.","And in Maryland, just last week, a bunch of us were there giving our public presentations, and we unveiled what we think is really a beautiful design for National Harbor. And we believe it's reflective of not only the history of Maryland, but the fine monuments in the area. It is a $925 million effort, luxurious, extraordinarily well designed, providing quite a few amenities that do not exist in Maryland or in the region, and certainly would be the finest resort in the state of Maryland, if we are lucky enough to be selected. That final decision, we're 1 of 3 there, will be decided according to the state by the end of this year.","And in Massachusetts, our RFP response is well underway. We've been working hard in the city of Springfield and with the State. We expect to submit everything required of us by the end of this year. And according to the state, a final decision is expected to be made in April of '14.","It was a busy, and I'm pleased to say, very productive quarter for us at MGM Resorts. Our margins are improving, we've kept a good eye on our costs, the property investments are yielding good returns on investment, we're planting seeds to grow this company further as we have consistently and determinately reduced our leverage, improved our balance sheet, and we're happy with our progress thus far.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thanks, Jim. During the third quarter, we were able to grow our revenues by 9%, which is led by a 22% increase in MGM China and 6% growth on the Las Vegas Strip. The leverage in our operating model allowed us to grow our EBITDA and expand our margins. Margins at our wholly-owned domestic resorts increased by 75 basis points year-over-year, led by an approximate 130 basis point improvement at our wholly-owned Strip properties. In Las Vegas, our luxury properties continue to lead the way, with 18% EBITDA growth in the quarter, driven by both casino and hotel segments of the business.","On the casino side, we continue to see strong activity from our high end international customers, as our marketing team remains focused on driving that business to our Strip resorts. Our efforts are evident as Baccarat volumes grew over 20% in the quarter, driving a 16% increase in table games revenue at our wholly-owned Las Vegas resorts. On the hotel side, our luxury resorts benefited from increased occupied rooms at Bellagio and MGM Grand and are experiencing better pricing due to increased convention room nights.","Our third quarter Strip REVPAR increased 3% year-over-year, consistent with our guidance, driven by a combination of both occupancy and rate increases. We expect our fourth quarter room revenue to be up slightly year-over-year on relatively flat REVPAR, with accelerating trends in the first quarter. In fact, looking into next year, our first quarter convention trends are looking exceptionally strong. We're approaching peak convention mix in the first quarter, with an expected 21% convention room mix. And beyond the first quarter, we expect an increasing convention room mix for all quarters throughout the year.","Shifting over to CityCenter. ARIA's EBITDA was $49 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% year-over-year. EBITDA was negatively impacted by approximately $17 million related to a lower hold percentage when compared to the prior year's quarter. ARIA's table game drop increased by 12% year-over-year. On the non-casino revenue side at ARIA, that increased 9%. During the third quarter, hotel occupancy increased 100 basis points to 89%, ADR increased 3% to $197, and REVPAR increased 4% to $177.","Food and beverage revenues increased as a result of the new Shawn McClain restaurant, Five50, which opened in July, as well as the continued increase in volume at our newly remodeled buffet. Entertainment revenues increased driven by a full quarter of Zarkana this year versus a partial quarter of the prior Elvis show in the year before. Crystals continues to outperform, up 26% compared to the prior year. We opened 3 new tenants in the third quarter, and more recently, we opened another tenant here in October. So we've added 4 new tenants to the lineup at Crystals here recently.","We're continuing to see some solid sales on the remaining residential inventory. During the third quarter, we sold 28 units at Mandarin Oriental and 2 units at Veer, for roughly $27 million in revenue on the condo front.","Earlier this month, we successfully refinanced CityCenter's previously outstanding debt, with a new $1.78 billion credit facility. This transaction significantly reduces our cash interest expense by roughly $80 million and increases CityCenter's financial flexibility and extends their maturity profile.","Looking at the balance sheet to help you with some of your modeling in the fourth quarter. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion in available liquidity under our corporate revolver, while MGM China has approximately $1.45 billion in availability at the end of the quarter under their revolver. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.4 billion, of which roughly $925 million was at MGM China.","During the third quarter, we spent approximately $78 million in CapEx at our wholly-owned domestic resorts. Our wholly-owned full year CapEx looks like it's going to come in closer to $300 million to $325 million this year versus our previous guidance of $350 million due to timing of certain projects.","During the third quarter, MGM China spent approximately $27 million at MGM Macau and about $31 million on our MGM Cotai development. For the year, we now expect to spend approximately $52 million on MGM Macau and about $260 million on MGM Cotai for all of 2013.","We expect corporate expense for the fourth quarter to be roughly consistent with the third quarter of around $50 million. Stock compensation expense is estimated to be about $78 million in the quarter. And depreciation expense is estimated to be consistent with the third quarter. We estimate that our gross interest for the fourth quarter will be approximately $210 million, which includes about $5 million from MGM China and about $9 million in noncash amortization.","With that, I'll turn it over to Grant Bowie to talk about MGM China.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, good evening to everybody.","For the third quarter, MGM China net revenue increased 22% to $808 million and generated EBITDA of $191 million. That's up 25% year-on-year. This number includes the branding fee of $8 million, but it also includes in this result negative impacts of approximately $12 million due to lower hold in our in-house VIP segment. And it also includes a $7.5 million impact from an accrual related to a one-off additional tourism tax assessment that we received.","VIP turnover increased by 28% year-over-year, and we continue to see success from the addition of our second floor gaming rooms and the introduction of a new operator in mid-April. We still see the opportunities for continued improvement in yield on the VIP tables to maximize our profitability from this segment. Overall, VIP wins for the quarter was approximately 2.8%, and that compares to the prior year of 3%.","We were able to drive main floor type of volumes up again by 10%, and revenues up 31% year-over-year, outperforming the potential growth, thanks to our continued focus on the table yield management and strategically targeting the premium segment. Now slot handle [ph] also increased by 10% during the third quarter. Looking forward, we're in the process of upgrading main floor, and enhancing our product offerings to drive future growth. Our remodeling includes renovation and expansion of the Supreme Lounge, which has been very successful for us, and we expect this to be completed in 2014. The Supreme Lounge, as many of you know, is an exclusive area dedicated to our high-margin, premium market customers.","Reinvention and improvement in product and service quality have been the catalyst to maintain the attractiveness in this very competitive market. And we expect this approach to continue into the future. MGM Cotai is well underway, as Jim mentioned, and we remain on track for an early 2016 opening. And our budget is still standing at $2.6 billion.","And with that, I'd like to turn back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Grant. And as Dan mentioned, the first quarter of next year is approaching all-time highs for us in terms of convention business. And the year, it looks like, it's shaking out well and is outpacing this year.","The increase in our convention room nights is important to us, because it will replace lower rate leisure bookings, which historically has helped us push rates in general in all of our segments. That is why we are optimistic for 2014. And by the way, typically, by the end of the year, we have booked about 80% of our planned convention room nights for the following year. Here on Halloween, we've already booked 88% of our targeted room nights for 2014, so we're nicely ahead of where we typically are.","We're pleased with this progress. We know that we have a lot of work to do. We're enjoying doing it. We remain focused on executing on the strategies we've laid out to you, both in terms of our operational strategy to drive margins and our capital strategy to improve our properties, increase our market share, in doing so with the lens of always looking toward improving our balance sheet, continue to get stronger financially.","We're quite excited what technology is bringing to this company, both in terms of M life on the revenue side and in terms of operating our business more efficiently and more pleasantly for our employees, for example, a new HR transformation software, called Workday, which is being rolled out as we speak.","And we're excited about talking to you about the future, and we wanted to give you plenty of time. So with that, I'll turn it over to the operator, and we can move right into the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dan, can you just talk for a minute more about your outlook for flat REVPAR growth in the fourth quarter? I was a bit surprised at that, given that the comps aren't really that tough. I know the focus is on '14, and the growth you can see there, but it would be helpful to better understand what you're expecting for the fourth quarter.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. The fourth quarter of this year, Felicia, is consistent with our expectation all year long. I think, overall, as we guided our mix for the year, we're looking at kind of 14.5% to 15%. And it looks like we're going to come in for the year right in that range, so it's consistent with last year's mix, maybe up a touch over last year. In the fourth quarter, we had some decent activity last year in a slow period from call it, Thanksgiving to Christmas, with a couple of decent shows that we had over at Mandalay and those shows that kind of rotated out as they typically do from just a seasonality perspective. So we've got -- as a company, we've got a tough comp down at Mandalay, just because of a couple of decent size shows. And that's kind of opened REVPAR back. And, of course, in this time period, our core properties just don't have the pricing power that the luxury properties do overall when you get into that November, December time period.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up. You -- I believe, you said that Baccarat in the quarter was up 16% year-over-year. Can you help us think about what the math table percentage was then, because I think the overall was 10%?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","The Baccarat volumes in the quarter, I think, were up 20%. I think the revenue side was up 16% on table games. And non-Bac table games in the quarter was relatively flat on a volume perspective.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, I was hoping maybe you can share with us any updated thoughts on the Massachusetts opportunity. Obviously, a lot of news there recently.","James Joseph Murren","But we've worked hard there. We believe that we have a great plan for Springfield. We have, obviously, been chosen by the city of Springfield to deliver on this vision. We've had an extraordinarily very close relationship with this process, really, from the beginning. John McManus, who looks a bit tired, he's our General Counsel. He's also in the room. He's been to Mass many a time, including about 2 weeks ago at a hearing. And we feel like we have delivered on everything that we need to deliver on, and that we've seen no reason whatsoever that we would not be found suitable there. And I can't speak for the other operators. Obviously, there's been an awful lot of activity and drama there. But we like the process, it's been very transparent to us, and we believe there's no reason why we will not be found suitable. And as I said earlier, the state has indicated that it would like to make a determination by April, I think, Bill, right, of next year.","William Joseph Hornbuckle","Licensing before the end of [ph] November.","James Joseph Murren","And licensing before November of next year.","William Joseph Hornbuckle","Of this year.","James Joseph Murren","Of this year. I'm sorry, licensing, November this year and April for the final.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then I have a follow-up for Dan. Dan, I was maybe hoping you can give us a little but more detail or clarification on your prepared remarks about seeing accelerated trends in 1Q. Are you talking about REVPAR growth? Are you talking about room revenues? Or are you talking about revenues overall or margin improvement? I'll leave it very broad and open ended, just to get some clarification in terms of how you guys are thinking 1Q '14 is shaping up based on what you know now.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, what we can see, Joe, is very strong hotel part of our business, obviously, led by the convention business, which is exceptionally strong in the first quarter. And I would say then strong year-over-year for each quarter thereafter based on the forward trends we're seeing right now. So the convention side is going to lead the charge as it relates to room rate growth and REVPAR growth next year. And we think we'll get into more color on that in our next call, but we think that's going to be up nicely in the first quarter. And hopefully, that'll set the trend for the rest of the year.","James Joseph Murren","Just to add, Dan, that everything that we had hoped the first quarter to shape up to be, we feel more confident than ever that it will exactly be that. And I would just go as far as to say yes to all your questions, Joe, in terms of not only revenues but margins because of the substantial amount of growth that we see on the books and the event calendar for 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Securities.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have a quick question for Grant. Recently, there's been some focus in Mainland China on anticorruption policies. And do you have any sense overall -- or is there any chatter about how much business that might be, either government-related, actually, flows through Macau. I know it's difficult to answer, but more importantly, what are the safeguards that you have in place to prevent it at MGM?","Grant R. Bowie","There's, obviously -- has been a lot of talk. And as you well know, as a company, we're particularly focused on all of the practices that we need to do, not just for Macau, but also for our global structure, particularly, in the areas of AML and KYC, et cetera. So I think that within our company, there's certainly been an ongoing and continuous commitment to ensuring we meet those obligations. I think in Macau as a whole, I think that the systems are continuing to be enhanced as a destination. We, obviously, become more sophisticated in managing those practices. So Macau government is very focused on ensuring that it meets its obligations, and we work closely together with them to continue to enhance those practices over time.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then returning to the U.S. Dan, if you could give us a sense of how much lower rated business is in Vegas next year that could be displaced or burned off? And then what the -- what's the typical difference in total spend, that's both in room and out-of-the-room spend between those 2 customer groups?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, I think, Harry, one of the big pieces that we're still burning off, particularly, on the convention side are some of the contracts that we had entered into in 2009, 2010, that were multi-year contracts that are still burning off last year, this year and next. And I think last year's number, we were still roughly about 50%, 60% of our convention room nights were booked in those more difficult times than some of the mirror contracts that we are entering into now, obviously, at much different rates than we were getting back in '09 and '10. So there's still a fair amount of convention business that's burning off in that particular segment, and that's going to continue to be a benefit as we move forward in the forward booking, on the convention side.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you put some numbers around just the differential in the replacement and the upgrade?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, I think, just -- I think, purely from a room-rate standpoint, you're looking at upwards around $50 to $60 in displacing that lower-end leisure rates into a convention room rate. So it's pretty significant just on the room rate piece, not to mention the ancillary benefits of the restaurants, the entertainment venues by having that better priced customer in town. And the impact of the tide rising for some of our core properties as we're able to kind of use those, particularly, at the likes of Luxor and Excalibur, as we're able to use those in terms of overflow during peak period to help them drive rate midweek. So that's important component for our business.","James Joseph Murren","And Harry, what I would add is, because of the increased convention base, not just for us but in the city, it will also bring in that lower end leisure rate up also. You'll get a double hit there also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lewis Chinchilla [ph] with Amber Research [ph].","Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to ask a little bit about operating leverage for next year. Jim, I think you talked a little about margin growth. This quarter, we did see the -- I guess, flow through was a little bit lower than the really great numbers you guys drove in 1Q and 2Q. Whether it's Corey or Jim, could you guys talk a little bit about expected flow through for next year in terms of kind of what the model is set up to do right now? And I'm speaking specifically as it relates to the Vegas properties.","James Joseph Murren","Sure. Maybe I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to either Dan or Corey. The goal that we set for ourselves a couple of years ago was to drive 50%, 60% flow through. And, obviously, we've done a bit better than that. Some quarters, there's been as much as 100%. And we can't do that every single quarter, we just can't do it. But we would expect significant flow through in '14 and '15. I think year-to-date, we're up about 90-something percent, Sarah?","Sarah Rogers","94%","James Joseph Murren","94% year-to-date on flow through, and so that's a pretty good number. We're shooting to continue to drive our flow through up as much as possible. And nice to be getting 100% all the time, but our goal has been in the 60% range on a long-term basis, and I think that's extremely achievable.","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. Any ADR increase, obviously, will always go to the bottom line. And then, in general, as the convention mix improves and the catering improves, that's a higher-margin business than our normal food and beverage business. Hopefully, with the increased visitation, it will increase the occupancy in our shows, which also goes all to the bottom line, because those are just empty seats, if they're not being filled right now. So I think the flow through next year should be as strong, if not stronger, than what we've seen this year.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's really helpful. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up, Corey, you just mentioned a little bit about some of the shows. But I guess, just generically, it looks to us, at least like some of the non-gaming and non-hotel revenue was up nicely in the quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about -- do you see enough kind of things going on, whether it's nightclubs or conventions to continue to drive that -- I guess, that category higher than average? I know you're seeing good -- kind of good consumer spending trends. Or is that a little bit better than, at least, core gaming right now?","Corey I. Sanders","They're improving slightly. I think a lot of our capital investments have paid off between the show at Mandalay Bay, some of the new restaurants, the nightclubs, we're seeing that additional spend. And people coming here for reasons other than gaming. So I think it's slowly coming back, especially at the core properties, the luxury properties, they're seeing a little bit better spend.","James Joseph Murren","Yes. And I would add, Corey, when you have higher convention business, you get -- typically get a lot of buyouts of venues that would otherwise be closed. You could have night clubs that are bought out during the day. You can have parties out at a pool or at the beach at Mandalay. You'll have tremendous amount of incremental found revenue for us when convention business is robust. And it, certainly, will be in the first quarter, that's going to have a significant impact in our non-gaming revenue in the first quarter. And those are very profitable revenues for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Obviously, we continue to hear a lot of discussions around Japan. Can you just give us an update hereon in terms of thinking with regard to legislation, and how you guys think you're positioned for that opportunity longer term?","James Joseph Murren","You want to do that one, Bill?","William Joseph Hornbuckle","Yes. Real quick, obviously, we know that Diao [ph] in session right now, they're dealing with a complicated tax issue. But there's belief that time will allocate and allot for them to be able to take on the question. We're hoping and believe that by spring, something will come forward. From that process, it's still complicated. I mean, at the end of, when it's all said and done, you're probably looking at actual license and selections into '18, '19 -- sometime in that timeframe. We're positioned, we've been on the ground, we continue to be on the ground better part of the year, 1.5 years now, and we're excited. I mean, at the end of the day, it will be probably be the second largest marketplace in the world, and so we're very focused on it from that perspective.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And one quick follow-up, if I may. Obviously, the CityCenter capital structure continues to get a lot better, the properties trending in the right direction, with that said, how do you think about sort of the opportunity to buy out your partner at some point? And then on top of that, again, how are you thinking about monetizing the Crystals longer-term?","James Joseph Murren","You want to take that one, Dan? Did you want to do that? We have great relationships with our partners. They have not asked us to buy them out. I think they're pretty happy with the fact that the asset is increasing in value. I'm sure that we would like to own 100% of it someday, but I don't think that day is today, because they're happy with their position. So I'd have to leave that one for some time in maybe, in the future. In the meantime, we did look at selling Crystals earlier this year. Cap rates had fallen to sub-5%. It was an extraordinary time for retail, particularly luxury retail. And we did quite a bit of work on this. And we concluded at the time, we just weren't prepared to sell Crystals. We just didn't have enough of the diligence done to do it, and the market moved away from us a little bit. So it's something that partners are willing to pursue at the right valuation. We think that time is on our side from a standpoint of the fact that the NOI at Crystals continues to grow. We think it's going to have a tremendously strong year in 2014. And the more track record we develop at Crystals, the better cap rate we're going to get and the more robust bidding will likely to have in the future. So that's not a long-term asset, most likely, if we get the right valuation, but it's not something that we're going to sell this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Grant Govertsen with Union Gaming Macau.","Grant Govertsen - Union Gaming Research, LLC","Got a question for Grant. In your prepared remarks, you were talking about the Supreme Lounge that will be coming online next year. And I may have missed it, but could you give us a sense for the scope of it, in terms of the number of tables or the incremental number of premium tables that this might be bringing online?","Grant R. Bowie","Actually, at this stage, it's, actually, primarily focused on premium slots, and we're working through just some final details in the layout, primarily, with some additional private rooms. But it's about providing additional capacity, because that's where it seems to be growing at the moment. At the moment, it's not for tables. Once we do put that additional slot area in there that a couple of the private rooms which are currently running as machines will be available to add table games back into -- so go back to the original rather than swing around [ph]. So that's basic [indiscernible]. We're looking on the order of 60 to 70 more units.","Grant Govertsen - Union Gaming Research, LLC","Understood. And, actually, that leads to my follow-up. And it sounds nitpicky in the face of terrific results, but your slots are, it looks like it's gone down sequentially for couple of quarters, and perhaps the supreme lounge is a part of that solution, but any color you could provide on that would be appreciated.","Grant R. Bowie","Yes. I think one of the challenges is that a lot of our business is really at the high premium. And we had a very, very strong first half, and we had some really good performance and customers. And that tends to set up a bit of a cycle. And as a result of that, there's -- there has been a longer period between visits coming into this fourth quarter, we've actually seen -- particularly, with the holidays we just got through, we're seeing some performance improvement in that. Slot business, I think, overall, has seen some flattening in the market. Even though there's good growth across the market, the growth rates have slowed a little bit. So we need to get back and look at product mixes and everything like that. Compounded with that a little bit is I think you're aware, that the government has been implementing a number of responsible gambling initiatives over the last 8 or 9 months. And we're just working through all of those, which we just have to accommodate. So it's a combination of a number of events, but we're comfortable that we need to put out when we put all those pieces back together and get all the bits working together again, that it will come back and will continue to grow.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I actually had a few questions. Dan, I wanted to revert back to the comments that you made earlier on the convention mix. You did say first quarter convention room nights, 21% of total?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Correct.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I would assume, if the rest of the year is up, across the board year-over-year, that you're looking for a mix record base, because if I recall, that's kind of around 16%, historically?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. We think for the year, Carlos (sic) [Carlo], based on how we're pacing right now that we're going to start coming and approaching near that level, whether or not we get fully back to that peak which was slightly over 16%. It will depend a little bit on some of the year-on-year bookings, but right now, we're probably projecting this year to finish up like I said earlier 14.5% to 15%. Next year, convention mix, we're probably looking at 15.5% to kind of 16% in that particular room segment for us. So we're getting pretty close, and a couple of things swing our way, we could very well be back at peak level very easily next year.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then I think you also mentioned 80% or 88%, I wasn't sure which it was, but percentage of -- percent of those room nights were already on the book. Would you guys be able to give us some color around the rate cadence of that business on the books as of today?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","It was 88%. Those are actual hard contracted room nights for next year and we're up kind of mid-single-digits in terms of rate.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then one last follow-up, if I could, just on the margins. When I look at kind of the mix between hotel revenue and other, I think that, that basically, accounts for some of the sequential stuff. But if you look back historically at revenue levels similar to where you are today or were in this quarter on the Strip, and you look at kind of the mix of hotel, which is actually skewed higher as a percentage of your total revenue, you've actually done more in aggregate EBITDA in prior years prior to the cost cut. So I'm wondering if there's something else that's kind of changed in the margin structure. And fully acknowledging, obviously, you guys are doing a nice job growing EBITDA with mid-single digit revenue growth, but if there's something else that has changed since kind of years past, where the margin growth is going to be a little bit harder to come by as we go forward.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, I think what you're seeing now, Carlos (sic) [Carlo], and Corey will straighten me out where I go astray. But I think, really, what you're seeing is part of the disparity and what the city-wide do within the portfolio of properties. And so that midweek business leisure-wide versus the city-wide convention room nights is really driving more, I would say, seasonality in the business quarter-to-quarter today than it did say, a few years past or during the peak time period where we were able to kind of price rooms, not just because of convention, but we had stronger leisure business, when we moved into say, the seasonally slower summer months in June, July and August. So you just don't have that depth of leisure business. And that there's some disparity there some seasonally. For us, we also have kind of things that happen, I mean, Bellagio had a pretty low hold percentage last year, as they did a touch better this year, but it's not a Bellagio like hold percentage. So that too affects when you're looking at quarter-to-quarter kind of flow through and leverage in the system. We're not using that as an excuse, because our overall hold percentage was fine. But, obviously, there's a lot of -- lot more volume here at Bellagio than some of our other buildings from the high-end perspective.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And lastly, and I'll listen. Just anything in the fourth quarter from a hold perspective at any of the properties in Vegas that stands out that we should be mindful of?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","I think Bellagio actually did better in their fourth quarter hold percentage which helped last year even itself out for the full year. But I can't...","James Joseph Murren","MGM may have -- I don't want to...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, Bellagio and MGM. We'll have to go back and look, Carlos (sic) [Carlo]. But probably, if there were any, it would've been at Bellagio and MGM, that may have held a little bit better last year.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One for Grant. First, looking at your Cotai property and targeting early 2016, I guess, it seems like, in recent years, the Macau government has kind of staggered a little bit some of the property openings using labor quotas and things. And there are a couple of properties that are kind of targeting a similar timeframe to open. Do you have any sense from the government, whether they are more comfortable with multiple properties opening within the same sort of 6 months period? Or any thoughts on that?","Grant R. Bowie","I don't think there's -- the government has that particular view. And I don't think they've actually staggered them. I think what's happened is the realities of individual timelines have actually determined their opening dates. But I'd -- clearly, we all know in this marketplace that there is a lot of product coming on stream. And I think everybody is working diligently as we are to make sure that we're in a position to be able to get the people, get the opportunities and get the product and get open on time. So I think there's a lot of work to go. But I think it'll work itself through as programs normally do. But what we're doing is building a whole series of different scenarios that we can work with and around.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up question for Vegas and the convention business, which I know has been talked about a lot. But you made a comment that you're booked ahead in terms of the number of room nights you may approach peak mix. And you mentioned that the rates for convention business would be up mid-single-digits, and that helps you to -- that you're essentially also replacing leisure travel when you increase the mix of convention business. And so does that sort of suggest that your REVPAR expectation overall for Vegas next year is in that mid-single digit range?","James Joseph Murren","Well, we try to give quarter -- Robin, it's Jim. We try to give quarter-to-quarter guidance. We certainly will do better than that in the first quarter, but beyond that, we just feel better about just giving you the quarter-to-quarter guidance. Clearly, the metrics are setting up favorably for us for the whole year, given the fact that our -- will do. We'll have stronger convention business that generates higher rates. The convention business next year will be at a higher rate than this year. The mix will be higher than this year, it will replace lower-rated business such as leisure. As Corey said, there'll be more conventions in town next year, which could drive the core properties for us and help leisure rates, and, in fact, help retail rates in general, FIT rates as well. So we're setting ourselves up as a valley here in Las Vegas to have strong REVPAR growth in 2014. But I think we're going to stick to the quarter-to-quarter guidance for now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You talked about how some of the lower end Strip properties are going to benefit from overflow from the more high-end ones in 2014. Given the lower-end properties are coming off of a lower base, could you see higher revenue and EBITDA growth at those properties?","James Joseph Murren","I think that's completely conceivable. The deltas on some of those properties could be higher, because of the lower base and because of what we're doing to those properties, not just New York, New York and Monte Carlo as we mentioned. But really there's a upgrade program underway at all of our properties, to one degree or another. So I don't think it's unreasonable to think that. What do you think, Corey?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes, I think the last, what I would recall substantial increase in convention attendance city-wide was 2011. And if you look at the results of our core properties from 2011, that showed signs of not only revenue growth but EBITDA growth. So I would suspect we should be able to see some of that in 2014.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And can you just give us an update on your plans for the Borgata and your share there?","James Joseph Murren","As you know we're working with the state on licensing, and we hope to be relicensed in that state. John, when -- by the -- what would you guess?","John M. McManus","We don't -- we're in the process. I think a reasonable estimate would probably be first quarter.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, so the idea is -- that's our first goal -- is to be relicensed in the state. We expect -- that we have no reason to expect we won't be relicensed there. Up until that point, we can't have any view on Borgata. In fact, I saw Keith Smith this week, and I can't even talk to him about Borgata according to the settlement agreement. So once we are relicensed, which we expect that we will be, we look forward to sitting down with Boyd and helping map the strategy of Borgata's future.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Tom, just a quick follow-up. We still have about $110 million, 1-1-0 million sitting in our New Jersey trust account that comes to us as well once this process is over.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And related to the online gaming opportunity, do you receive -- are you part of the JV when it launches? Or do you have to wait until you're licensed in that state again?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, our trust is still the economic beneficiary. But as far as actually having a seat at the table, we have to wait for the license, but we're still the economic beneficiary.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I've got no questions, a lot have been asked and answered.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Bain with Sterne Agee.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Guys, can we get any current thoughts on the culinary union discussions. On your website, you thought maybe a settlement could happen this month. And any foreseen changes there? Obviously, those are factored into your flow-through thoughts for next year, correct?","James Joseph Murren","Sure. We've been working on this agreement for quite some time. As you know, the culinary agreement is typically 5 years -- 4, 5 years. And we've been adding strong and very productive negotiations with the culinary this year. All of us have been involved in that, Corey, myself, Dan, Bill Hornbuckle. And we feel like we have a good understanding between the leadership of the culinary and ourselves in terms of what the challenges are in the market, economic challenges and a recovering, but not fully recovered market and some of the challenges of operating in the business in 2013, '14, '15, that did not exist a few years ago in terms of how operations are staffed, what's going on in terms of flow through and in terms of volume. And I'd have to say that it's been very productive, wouldn't you say, Corey? And we have no reason to believe that we're not going to be, really, resolved on this quite soon. Our goal is to forge an agreement that we work together with the union, we have a great relationship with them and create a package with them that not only reflects those conditions of the market but the concerns that the members have in terms of health care, in terms of benefits, in terms of job security and in terms of growth. And I also have to say that, that union and others have been very supportive of our efforts not only here in Las Vegas. But when we've gone on the road, whether it be in Massachusetts, in Maryland, we saw a lot of our culinary friends in the audience last week, didn't we, Bill, supporting us at National Harbor, and it was great to see them there and other unions as well. So I'm very confident that we'll be done soon. All of our negotiations are incorporated into our thoughts for our forecast for '14 and are incorporated in what we discussed in terms of margins and flow through.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Great. And just 2 more if I could, quickly. The room remodel at The Hotel, I don't think it was mentioned in the rebranding to Delano. Just -- is that project timeline going to remain, or the capacity needs changing things there for earlier, mid-2014?","James Joseph Murren","Yes. We changed -- we had a couple of room remodel changes when we do our model rooms. And we finally all signed off on it not too long ago. We really liked the product, so did Delano. So when are we going to start that?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","We're looking at kind of an April-ish start date to start the project itself and look to complete around September, October, those roughly 1,200 suite.","Corey I. Sanders","And as those rooms come back online, we will actually sell them. We won't name it Delano, until we're 75% complete. But the actual delay in the room remodel has actually worked out in our benefit, especially with the strong first quarter convention business.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, that was going to be a concern of ours, that we have a lot of rooms out of service in the first quarter. Now, we won\u2019t, because we're starting in April.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Well, that's awesome. Okay, great. And just lastly, Grant, if I could. Pension [ph], do you have any thoughts there in terms of expansion plans? And what that could look like in terms of capacity, amenities, timing, if anything, for you guys?","Grant R. Bowie","I think, I will [indiscernible].","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Or whoever wants to take that question.","Grant R. Bowie","Do you want it, or do you want me to take it?","James Joseph Murren","Go ahead, Grant.","Grant R. Bowie","Okay. I think pension [ph] for Macau is a fabulous opportunity, and we like it like most are studying it. I think there's still a lot of planning and consideration to be done. Obviously, Jim Long [ph], the major part that's -- on Hanjin [ph] is about ready to open. So that's really going to be a catalyst. But I think, yes, it's certainly part of our overall strategy, but I think we need to do it in an appropriate way. And it needs to, obviously, balance the development of the region. But it's certainly something that's on our radar, and we're looking at very positively.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Praveen Choudhary with Morgan Stanley.","Praveen K. Choudhary - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Very quickly for Grant. When you mentioned about $12 million for the lower hold, as well $7.5 million for the accrual, can you talk about similar number in Q2 of '13 or last year Q3 of '12, if you do have that number?","Grant R. Bowie","Actually, I don't have that back into the prior period. I think that for the Q2, it was pretty well even. That really wasn't such a big impact, specifically. But Praveen, let me get back to that, and I'll get you that information to be accurate. I don't want to guess.","Praveen K. Choudhary - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's perfect. And then I can -- if I can add one more question. You have given us the total CapEx of $2.6 billion. But if you have to include capitalized interest and land cost, what would be that number? Because most of the other operators are giving the full CapEx, including those 2 items.","Grant R. Bowie","You want me to go, Dan, or do you want to pick it up?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. I mean, obviously, Praveen, the land concession contract is public and out there already. I think we've spent about $60 million, $70 million in total on the deposit, and there's annual payments on a go-forward basis, so that's public information, and you should be able to grab that. As far as capitalized interest, we'll be working through that. We'll be able to give guidance going forward, but we don't think it's going to be that material in the overall schemes, given the free cash flow and the amount of debt that will be at the MGM China level, even at the peak point of construction.","Grant R. Bowie","I could tell you that the total [indiscernible] value is $175 million when you go to the public record.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","On the [indiscernible] contract.","Grant R. Bowie","Yes, okay.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Operator, I think that brings us to the top of the hour. And if there's any more follow-ups or questions, the team will be here all day and happy to take any calls off-line. Thank you, all, for participating this morning, and have a Happy Halloween.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

Participants are in a listen-only mode. After the company\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D\u2019Arrigo.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Thank you, Mackenzie, and good morning everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and a replay of the call will be available later on today on our website. This morning, we\u2019ve furnished our press release on Form 8-K with the SEC as well.","Before turning it over to Jim, on this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today\u2019s press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website. Finally, please note that the presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jim.","Jim Murren","Well, thanks Dan, and good morning, everyone. This morning we\u2019ve reported solid second quarter results led by wholly-owned domestic resorts\u2019 adjusted property EBITDA growth of 4% and record EBITDA for both CityCenter and Macau. These results were achieved despite the economic headwinds all companies are facing in these volatile times.","Our operating teams remained quite focused on maximizing our revenue and keeping costs in check to drive cash flows throughout our portfolio properties. And at the same time, we continue to reinvest in our properties for the future and constantly introduce new and exciting offerings for the guests. During the second quarter, we observed a pocket of softness in the U.S. consumer beginning in mid-May. This was reflected in spend particularly in domestic table games, entertainment and in retail.","We also experienced slower than anticipated in the year, for the year convention bookings during that brief period. And based on these current trends, we expect RevPAR in the third quarter will be slightly down. But despite these headwinds, we were able to grow our EBITDA, our RevPAR and our market share during the second quarter.","The softness we experienced during the second quarter for convention bookings in the year, for the year has not impacted long-term bookings. In fact looking out into 2013, we\u2019re encouraged to see convention bookings, the pace being up year-over-year and although it\u2019s still early, 2014 pace is even stronger. We\u2019ve also fortunately recently seen a pickup in U.S. consumer trends at our wholly-owned properties.","We remain focused on driving market share and profitability in a variety of non-capital intensive opportunities; for example, M life. Our success here overall is evident in the fact that we\u2019ve grown our market share to-date in table games and in slots, and we continue to outperform the market in terms of ADR and occupancy. We also grew our EBITDA at our regional properties year-over-year, despite an increasingly competitive environment there and some tough trends in the U.S. regional gaming markets. And we believe this is due to our M life customer loyalty program as being working.","We\u2019ve been actively cross-marketing our Las Vegas resorts to our regional customers and this program has done very well with approximately 20,000 room nights booked through this campaign since its inception in April. And our marketing alliances are successful in building loyalty. Ameristar has been a great partner so far and we look forward to continuing to grow our network.","Yesterday, we announced a partnership with the Morgans Hotel Group. Through this partnership, Morgans will transform what is now THEhotel at Mandalay Bay into the Delano Las Vegas. We will begin remodeling the rooms of THEhotel in mid-2013. And through the Light Group, a subsidiary of Morgans, we will be introducing three new restaurants and a cutting-edge new nightclub, injecting some fresh energy into Mandalay Bay.","We continue to be very focused on customer acquisition and expanding our reach into social media. And we have partnered with Playstudios to create and launch myVEGAS. myVEGAS is a social gaming app that recreates the Las Vegas trip experience and exclusively features our brands. It represents our collective thinking about how to leverage our brands and social channels to further engage our customers. It\u2019s a unique and fresh take on social gambling and it\u2019s a very cost-effective vehicle to acquire customers.","And of course, we\u2019re looking to expand our brands and operating expertise into some key strategic regions. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen in the headlines, we are actively pursuing growth opportunities in some gateway cities including Toronto, regions such as Western Mass., Maryland and of course Cotai through MGM China. We believe we\u2019re well-positioned in these markets and believe that there\u2019s not only great opportunities on a standalone basis, but also offer an opportunity to expand our network into Las Vegas through M life.","We\u2019re weathering this economic environment well. We\u2019re proud of our position here in Las Vegas and how we\u2019re doing and in the hospitality industry in general and we see many opportunities to grow our company.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Dan to talk about our operating results and financial position.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Thank you, Jim. As Jim mentioned previously, our wholly-owned domestic resorts adjusted property EBITDA grew by 4% in the second quarter, despite the fact that our hold was down year-over-year. Our hold percentage during the second quarter was 17.7% compared to 18.2% in the prior year. Also you recall that Tunica was closed due to the flooding last year and reported a loss in the prior-year quarter of approximately $2 million and this year reported EBITDA of approximately $11 million.","We grew our wholly-owned domestic hotel revenues by approximately 3% year-over-year despite the MGM Grand having approximately 67,000 rooms out of service for its ongoing room remodel program in the quarter, pretty impactful to the Grand and a little bit more I would say of a disruption to the Grand than we had originally anticipated there.","Moving over to our balance sheet, we currently have $855 million in available capacity under our revolver and over $700 million in excess cash, totaling just over $1.5 billion in liquidity excluding MGM China. We believe we will soon have the opportunity to refinance some of our secured debt at progressively lower rates, which will also enhance our free cash flow going forward.","Just last week, we launched to the marketplace a refinancing in Macau. The proposed $1.5 billion five-year credit facility will be a combination of term loan and revolver. We\u2019ve received strong initial support from our lenders and look forward to showing you all of the details of that transaction upon its completion. As you\u2019re aware, we continue to be debt-free in Macau on a net basis. So this financing will provide MGM China the financial flexibility to carry out its development plans in Cotai.","Our second quarter capital expenditures were $102 million including $18 million at MGM China. We continue to expect our CapEx for the full year to be approximately $350 million. Our MGM Grand room remodel continues to progress with approximately 3,300 rooms completed. The project is on schedule for a September completion date. In the fall, we will begin the remodel of the Bellagio Spa Tower rooms, which will cost us approximately $40 million and is included in our full-year capital budget. The room remodel will begin here in August and be completed right before the holidays later on this year.","Just to give you some guidance in terms of the third quarter, our stock compensation expense is estimated to be approximately $9 million to $10 million. Depreciation expense in the quarter is estimated to be approximately $230 million to $235 million. Our interest expense in the second quarter was $277 million including approximately $6 million from MGM China and $17 million in amortization expense. We estimate that our gross interest expense for the third quarter will be roughly in line with the second quarter.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Bobby Baldwin to talk about CityCenter.","Bobby Baldwin","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone or good afternoon. We\u2019re excited to report that ARIA, Vdara, and Crystals each reported record EBITDA in the quarter as well as overall CityCenter resort operations achieving record EBITDA of $71 million in the second quarter of this year.","ARIA\u2019s second quarter record EBITDA of $56 million was a 5.4% increase from the second quarter last year. The year-over-year EBITDA growth is impressive given ARIA held 24% in the current year\u2019s quarter compared to 29.2% in the prior year in table games. ARIA\u2019s growth despite having held a lower year-over-year rate is indicative of the growing core customers at ARIA.","ARIA achieved a significant milestone in the quarter with occupancy of 92.7%, the highest level to-date, and the first time occupancy exceeded 90% for an entire quarter. June occupancy in particular was the highest since opening and marked the fourth consecutive month above 90%. ARIA also realized its highest quarterly RevPAR to-date of $187. It is noteworthy that the growth in the hotel is occurring in more profitable cash businesses as we continue to perfect the market mix at ARIA.","In the casino, we are pleased to report that second quarter table game drop remained strong. Slot revenue also increased indefinitely by 12% compared to the second quarter last year and poker revenues were a record level for the quarter.","Tickets have gone on sale for Zarkana, which is set to open on November 1st. This is our new show. Early ticket sales and interest in the show have been extremely encouraging and indicate that this will be a valuable addition to ARIA resort.","In addition to Zarkana, there are several other important changes occurring throughout ARIA. On August 1, Tetsu, a teppanyaki grill opened adjacent to barMASA and next month Javier\u2019s, a high-end Mexican restaurant located off the casino floor will commence operations.","We\u2019re excited about these two new venues and feel that they will better align our offerings with the expectations of our guests and further enhance the experience at ARIA. We\u2019ve also broken ground on our Las Vegas Boulevard marquee sign for ARIA. This marquee will feature the largest digital screen on the strip and increase our visibility and drive foot traffic to all of CityCenter.","Vdara also reported EBITDA of $7 million, up 22.6% from last year. Vdara continues to show increases year-over-year with revenues up almost 17% and occupied rooms up 16.7%.","At Crystals, second quarter 2012 EBITDA, the highest ever recorded, was $8.3 million versus $5.7 million last year. The increase is the result of higher rent revenue for percentage rent tenants and rent for new store openings. Operating expenses also decreased slightly.","One new tenant open at Crystals, Eres, a member of the Chanel brand featuring swimwear and lingerie opened April 18, a Pinkberry frozen yogurt concept will open August 2012 on The Strip in front of the Mandarin Oriental. As of June 30, Crystals was 87% leased and we\u2019re working diligently to lease out the remaining spaces.","That concludes my report. I\u2019ll turn it over to you, Grant Bowie.","Grant Bowie","Thanks, Bobby. MGM China had a solid second quarter. Net revenues were $709 million. This was up 6% year-on-year. Adjusted property EBITDA reached $187 million which is a net of 12 of branding fees. Before the branding fees, adjusted property EBITDA was $199 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year and a record high for the property.","The EBITDA margin before branding fees improved to 28.3% from 26.1% last year due mainly to a higher hold percentage on our VIP business, but also from continued improvement of our main floor contribution and the ongoing impact of our efficiency initiatives. Across our key revenue segments, we are seeing continued strong growth in the main floor table games, slots, and our in-house VIP while in the junket segment, as most know, we\u2019re seeing some slowing in its growth.","Overall win for the VIP segment was down 2% year-over-year despite our new in-house VIP space improving at a steady pace throughout the quarter. In fact, we had our best in-house VIP quarter ever during this period with rolling chip increasing 17% year-on-year.","On the main floor, table win was 17% year-over-year, an increase of 220 basis point improvement in our margins due to our table yield, key performance indicator-based efficiency decisions and table spread efforts. While the competition in this segment is heating up particularly in Cotai, we are looking to enhance our product offerings by introducing some new games to our players in the near future.","Our slot win increased 48% year-on-year. We credit this with our consistent and determined execution of our strategy which has allowed us to attract and retain top-tier customers. These customers continue to respond strongly to our slot product and service offerings particularly in the high-limit gaming areas.","The key elements of our business strategies are working. For example, we mentioned in our last call that we\u2019re working on driving visitation numbers by creating unique experiences for our guests. We opened up our butterfly exhibition in April. This exhibition has consistently attracted around 50,000 visitors a month. On an incremental basis, the exhibition increased our property visitation by 8%. In the month of June in particular, our property visitation increased 9% year-over-year, while in fact, the Macau visitation actually declined by 3.4%.","The incremental traffic lifted our cash, F&B sales during the quarter by 5% year-over-year, and certainly had a positive spillover effect on our mass gaming. To solely capitalize on the retail opportunities presented by the traffic increases, we\u2019re contemplating expanding our retail presence at the property in the future.","On the gaming front, we are working to complete our Level Two expansion. This project will deliver a high-quality product to house over 40 VIP gaming tables. The project is expected to be completed in early fourth quarter. It is our goal to increase revenue and junket productivity by introducing new junkets and reexamining existing junket table allocation.","On the main floor, we will introduce some new products to offer to our customers. And at the same time, we\u2019ll be focused on capital improvements next year to refresh our mass gaming experience.","On our Cotai project, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on getting our construction team in place as well as continuing to refine and enhance our designs. We continue to make progress with respect to our land concession process. A dialog with the Macau government has been positive and proceeding at an encouraging pace. While that process continues, we\u2019re making every effort to hit the ground running once the land process is complete. We\u2019re preparing our general building plan for submission shortly and we have submitted an application for our land prep work and working to have our general contractor on board in the fourth quarter.","Our Cotai project as previously advised will have approximately 500 tables, 2,500 slots, 1,600 rooms and a budget of approximately $2.5 billion. And this would be spent over a timeframe of approximately 36 months.","At the end of the second quarter, MGM China had approximate cash of $660 million, debt of $553 million and an adjusted leverage ratio of less than one or 0.84 to be precise based on trailing 12 month EBITDA.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Thank you.","Jim Murren","Thanks, Grant. Well, as we said, the macroeconomic environment has been tough, but we\u2019re very proud of our team efforts here in operating very well in these challenges. We had a solid second quarter and we believe 2012 will also be a solid year. We have a strong event calendar coming up for the balance of 2012, a lot of good concerts over at the MGM and Mandalay Event Center.","And looking ahead into 2013, all of our room product at MGM Grand at Bellagio will be fully refreshed and we know that that leads to higher ADR and better customer mix. We\u2019re going to have new entertainment and dining options throughout the portfolio including a massive new food and beverage and entertainment venue, Hakkasan over at MGM Grand, new Cirque du Soleil shows at ARIA and at Mandalay Bay and we\u2019re welcoming back Blue Man Group to Monte Carlo.","We remain positive about the future of Las Vegas as visitation continues to grow and we expect the new international terminal at McCarran which just opened in late June will help drive future growth and that builds on the momentum we\u2019re seeing from our European visitors. And the good news is there\u2019s no new supply coming to Las Vegas anytime soon.","Macau remains extremely exciting as a marketplace. We expect the infrastructure additions over the coming years will continue to drive visitation and visitors to MGM Macau and our Cotai resort to come.","I believe MGM is in the strongest financial position than at any point over the past three years and that our operating trends are improving. We continue to drive profitability both by managing our costs and FTEs and also by growing our revenues through M life, regional and global expansion opportunities and expanding our brand and customer reach via social media.","And with that operator, I\u2019d like to move over to the Q&A section of our call. Mackenzie?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays Capital.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning, guys.","Jim Murren","Good morning, Felicia.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi. Jim, just wanted to touch on the pocket of softness that you talked about. Obviously not a big surprise for everybody. But just as we look towards the second half of the year, it sounds like we should all assume that that persists. Is that how you think we should look at that?","Jim Murren","Well, maybe I\u2019ll take it and then we can turn over. We\u2019ve already seen an improvement in customer trends here in the third quarter. So we did see a pocket. I think it was but about a five-week period of time, would you say?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yeah, that\u2019s correct. We saw kind of starting in mid-May and kind of ended late in June where we saw kind of pace slow down, the market reacted and since that point in time, we\u2019ve seen on a forward booking trend standpoint, we\u2019ve seen the pace pick back up and we\u2019re starting to get that pricing power later on in the year. So, it\u2019s picked back up and that\u2019s why we kind of look at it as a little bit of a blip on the radar screen right now.","Jim Murren","But it did affect our bookings for the third quarter, which is reflected in what we talked about being RevPAR down slightly in the third quarter. In the year, for the year has been affected by that booking weakness that we saw in May and June. We think also people are kind of hanging out before the election and taking a breather on conventions a little bit before the national election. But, as I said earlier, that has not had any impact on our longer-term bookings.","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, because \u2013 thank you for that answer because it kind of feeds into a follow-up there. So if we think about maybe your RevPAR outlook for the second half based on what you said prior, I was thinking maybe low-single digits, but maybe that view is different based on what you said? And then also I was wondering how the current in the year, for the year trends foreshadow your future convention bookings?","Jim Murren","Hi, let me take that a little bit, and then anyone, Corey or Dan jump in. We gave RevPAR guidance as we typically do in the second quarter and we beat that in the second quarter, the one we just reported. Third quarter being down slightly, I\u2019m sure sounds a lot better than a lot of the room rate surveys. The room rate surveys that we see from you and your brethren are down, really kind of double-digits, and the reason why we\u2019re not down that much is we\u2019ve seen a good pick-up in the retail business, leisure business in particular. So, that\u2019s why RevPAR is probably a more moderate decline than you would have guessed.","Going into the fourth quarter, we just don\u2019t have a view yet on what the fourth quarter RevPAR\u2019s going to be, except for the fact that as I said earlier, consumer trends are starting to pick-up. The convention business in the third quarter of last year, in terms of mix, I think was an all-time record in terms of mix. So, we\u2019re going to be down in the convention business in the third quarter in terms of the mix relative to our total room count. But again, that\u2019s against an all-time record last year. And as I said, we \u2013 our pace was up for 2013. Anyone want to add anything to that or...?","Felicia Hendrix \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. I think I got it. Thank you.","Jim Murren","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.","Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan","Good morning, everybody. When you look at the trends on the Strip in May, June and July, is there a big difference between the consumer at the high-end versus the consumer at the core properties in terms of spend?","Jim Murren","Want to take that, Corey or...?","Corey Sanders","Yeah, I think at the high end at our Bellagio and our higher end properties, we\u2019ve seen spend actually increase pretty decently, mid-single digits, and at the core properties is probably where we\u2019ve seen a little bit of the reduction in spend from the core customer.","Jim Murren","Just adding to that, Corey, RevPAR in the luxury properties was up more in the second quarter than at the non-luxury properties. And the \u2013 that\u2019s RevPAR, but if you look at total revenue per occupied room, again doing better on the luxury side if you adjust for the hold that we had. Mirage held single-digits in the quarter. So that doesn\u2019t help much, but if you take out that \u2013 strip out some of the hold impacts, the revenue per occupied room looks pretty good. Our entertainment, retail on the luxury side was up year-over-year.","Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan","Great, and you would say that\u2019s consistent with what you\u2019ve seen in July, relative to what you\u2019ve seen in the second quarter?","Jim Murren","That\u2019s correct.","Joe Greff \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then you touched on this a little bit, the room renovation disruption at the MGM Grand, is there any way to quantify that on an EBITDA basis? I\u2019m presuming there\u2019s also some low hold there as well. If you can maybe help us understand how that property did between hold and the room renovation disruption on the EBITDA side, that would be helpful? And that\u2019s all from me. Thanks.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Yeah, Joe, they were \u2013 the Grand was probably the largest culprit in terms of the hold impact for the quarter. I think combined with the room disruption, you\u2019re probably looking at low to mid-teens kind of EBITDA impact overall between those two factors. So, you\u2019re kind of in that $13 million to $15 million range between hold impact and disruption from the room remodel program.","Jim Murren","I have to caveat by saying I hate using room remodels as an excuse. I hated it when I was an analyst, I hate it now. But a couple of things about the Grand, to defend the Grand because it actually \u2013 they did a great job over there. A couple of things we pulled out. The second quarter was the second highest RevPAR in the history of the property, the property opened back in 1993.","It had the second highest RevPAR since 2005. The Food and Beverage revenue was in the top 10 for a quarter in the history of the property, again open for quite a while. Wet Republic had its best quarter ever. It\u2019s the third highest second quarter in terms of entertainment. I mean there\u2019s a lot \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t know how many you want of these. Convention room nights were up 34% in the quarter. Slot handle was up. National cable game drop was up.","So, there\u2019s no doubt it hurts, but it\u2019s not an excuse to shift an explanation with I guess what\u2019s going on there, and it\u2019s done next month. And we know based on the rooms that have been brought back on to service, we\u2019re getting nice increases in ADR and the mix is starting to pick up and we\u2019ll have all of that for the fourth quarter and certainly for all of next year.","Corey Sanders","And the convention groups love the product. So, future bookings look really good on the convention side of the Grand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis from Nomura.","Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura","Hey. Corey, just following up on that last comment of yours. When we look into the 2013 bookings, it sounds \u2013 can you give us a little bit more meat on that bone in terms of the convention bookings relative to the amount that you really want on the books at MGM and Mandalay Bay and ARIA and Bellagio, the ones that really drive the train? Thanks.","Corey Sanders","Yeah, Harry, the numbers actually look pretty good there. We\u2019re seeing double-digit increases in the rooms on the books there. And everything\u2019s positive from that perspective both at Bellagio and MGM. Mandalay Bay is always the tough one, because there\u2019s so many rooms always on the books, but they\u2019re getting up there and their pace should be where we\u2019d like to see them. We\u2019re pretty comfortable where we are with rooms on the books at this time of year for what we\u2019re expecting for next year, which we expect a growth in the convention market and convention mix for the company.","Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura","So at this point in the year, are you about 50%, 60%, 70% of where you want to be for next year?","Corey Sanders","We\u2019re north of that.","Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura","Okay.","Bobby Baldwin","So is CityCenter or ARIA.","Corey Sanders","We\u2019re in a really good position. Now it\u2019s just filling the holes in tough periods, but we\u2019re pretty comfortable where we are right now on the convention side for next year.","Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura","Okay.","Corey Sanders","Even more so in 2014.","Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura","And another operating question for Jim. In 2009 and 2010, there were two years where you chopped several hundred million dollars of expenses out of your P&L. How much fat is left to cut? How much margin improvement can we see on the expense side over the next 12 months?","Jim Murren","Well, I lost about eight pounds in the past year, but \u2013 and Bill Hornbuckle found it, he said. We\u2019re pruning. We always prune, Harry. It\u2019s not going to be a significant amount of cost going forward, but we have a goal of trying to pull out about $50 million a year, out of our \u2013 out of our wholly-owned and corporate departments despite technology efficiencies, and we feel good about that. The major effort was back in 2008, 2009, and fortunately those days are well behind us right now.","So, I think you saw that we\u2019re getting decent flow through at some of our properties, especially if you kind of figure out the hold on it. We\u2019re going to \u2013 our FTEs are flat. We\u2019re managing our expanses in other ways where we can, and we\u2019re very, very focused on driving free cash. So, as we drive some revenue, we\u2019re committed to bringing as much of that to the bottom line as possible. And by building up some market share as we are and improving our customer mix which does lead to higher margins, we think that there\u2019s a good chance for that.","Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Strawn from Morgan Stanley.","Mark Strawn \u2013 Morgan Stanley",". Just one quick question on the Group side. You gave some good detail there on the room counts, but could you give some color on rates and how they\u2019re trending going forward, and if you\u2019ve seen any push back recently on any rate increases that perhaps were built into forward contracts?","Corey Sanders","Yeah, forward contracts were given price increases on all of them. We see rates going up. Our biggest challenge is having the leisure and FIT rates keep up with the convention rates which is not a bad challenge to have. But everything\u2019s looking positive on the rate increases.","Mark Strawn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Is there any way to give a range on that at all? Is it more low to mid singles for the group side or is it...","Corey Sanders","It\u2019s hard to say because of comparing apples-to-apples and who\u2019s in what space at what time. I mean, I would suspect, we\u2019re going to see mid single-digit increases.","Mark Strawn \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Cameron McKnight from Wells Fargo.","Cameron McKnight \u2013 Wells Fargo","Good morning. Thanks. Jim, a question or perhaps for Corey as well. It looks like visitation growth for the Strip was basically flat in April and May. How are you guys thinking about that as we look forward?","Jim Murren","Well, you\u2019re right. We don\u2019t have the June numbers out yet to my knowledge, right? What\u2019s that?","Sarah Rogers","Terminal 3 opening...","Jim Murren","Yeah. So Sarah\u2019s mentioning that what will be a little shot of adrenaline for Las Vegas with Terminal 3 opening up in June. That certainly helps us because we cater to an international customer. Particularly our European business does really well in the summer and continues to do well this summer. So I think that that will have a positive impact on visitation.","We don\u2019t have the numbers out yet, but that\u2019s our guess. We do believe \u2013 which is remarkable given where we were a few years ago \u2013 but we believe we\u2019re going to have an all-time record in terms of visitors to Las Vegas this year in 2012, north of 40 million people. And we\u2019re capturing more than our fair share of those visitors. And so I guess that you\u2019ll see a pick-up because of Terminal 3 and we have a lot of events coming up into the fourth quarter city-wide, not just for our company. So, we think the trends will be moderately up year-over-year for the balance of the year on visitors.","Cameron McKnight \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thanks. And then a follow-up for Grant. Grant, when you speak to your customers in China, what are you hearing from them at the moment?","Grant Bowie","Well, I think we\u2019re in an interesting time at this part of the world with obviously the transition about to take place. People actually are still \u2013 certainly have money. There\u2019s no question about it, but there\u2019s no question that people are just being a little more careful which we think is just a short-term phenomenon.","Cameron McKnight \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great, thanks very much.","Grant Bowie","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin Farley \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks. I wonder if you can give a little bit of color on the dividend, tax agreement with Macau in the quarter and just what it now would allow you to do with dividends going forward in terms of tax wise that it didn\u2019t before? And then I have another question on the quarter.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Robin, that agreement is pretty consistent with what the other operators in the market. It\u2019s basically an annual fee in lieu of the dividend tax. That agreement covers us through the year ended 2011 and any dividends payable through the year ended 2011 and we\u2019ve submitted an extension request to that agreement that\u2019s pending with the government currently.","So, it\u2019s roughly about, Grant, correct if I\u2019m wrong, about a $3 million, $4 million payment in the quarter that covered all the previous years and the extension right now is pending approval with the Macau authorities.","Robin Farley \u2013 UBS","Okay, great. And then I think in your introductory comments you mentioned that during the second quarter, I think you said there were more rooms out of service than maybe you\u2019d expected just with the renovations at the Grand. I wonder if you could \u2013 can quantify just given what percent of rooms are out of service for the quarter, how much that helped the reported RevPAR, the year-over-year percent change, if you could give sort of a rough quantification?","Corey Sanders","Yes, so the rooms out of order were what we were expecting. I don\u2019t think it has much of an impact at all when you\u2019re running mid-90%s occupied. It doesn\u2019t change a lot on your denominator. In a traditional hotel company, you take 10% out, it will have an impact, but for our high occupancies, it\u2019s hard to say. We\u2019ve lost a lot of money on the weekends when we\u2019re selling out. So, we\u2019ve looked at it many different times. I just \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s had an impact at all on it.","Robin Farley \u2013 UBS","Okay. Did you \u2013 can you quantify what percent of rooms out of service in the quarter?","Jim Murren","It\u2019s only one \u2013 it\u2019s a small number because if you take the \u2013 you mean, Robin, relative to our whole portfolio or relative to MGM Grand?","Robin Farley \u2013 UBS","Oh no, just like \u2013 in other words if it was 1% of your whole portfolio out of service, just, since we\u2019re putting that in relationship to the percent change in RevPAR year-over-year, I know it\u2019s going to be a small number, but I\u2019m just wondering how much of that 5%?","Corey Sanders","Keep in mind also we\u2019re taking our \u2013 we\u2019re taking our high end rooms out of service and replacing and filling more rooms at our lower end, which is going to have a negative impact on the company RevPAR.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","So, overall Robin, we had about in the quarter for Q2, we had about 63,000 rooms out of service, which was a little over 2% of rooms out of service year-over-year.","Robin Farley \u2013 UBS","Okay, great. Thank you. I don\u2019t know if I could ask one more about your Cotai approval. I know you\u2019ve talked about some of the things you\u2019re doing in preparation with your team on the ground. Do you still \u2013 are you still expecting sort of imminently to get the terms of the land agreement from the government? I don\u2019t know if you have any more of a clear timeframe on that?","Jim Murren","Well, I\u2019ll turn it over to Grant, but after our last call, we did \u2013 shortly after, I think it\u2019s within a week, we passed a very important hurdle and it\u2019s a multi-step \u2013 Grant, how many stages are there like 16, 17, 18 stages? I lose track.","Grant Bowie","A lot.","Jim Murren","Yeah, it\u2019s like a steeplechase, but we did have a good milestone after that. We\u2019ve had a few cents, but it\u2019s moved at a pace. Grant, if you want to add anything to it?","Grant Bowie","I think the key issue is that I think we\u2019ve pretty well provided the government everything we need and I just want to reiterate that the timeframe of actually execution. Yes, the land concession is critical, but the next phase which is getting the building built is just as time-consuming and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been taking this opportunity to get ourselves ahead of that curve. And we\u2019re pretty excited and the team\u2019s doing a great job on that. So, I think we always need to keep remembering, because I think we\u2019ve all become somewhat obsessed about the \u2013 it\u2019s only about the land. That\u2019s really only the beginning of the process and we\u2019re trying to parallel some of this work, and I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of that.","Robin Farley \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, good morning, everyone. Could you guys talk a little bit about during that soft period that you\u2019ve experienced in the 2Q, if there was an aggressive competitive response maybe from anyone on The Strip or could you kind of quantify how you\u2019re seeing the competitive environment going into the back half of this year?","Corey Sanders","Yeah, this is Corey. During that period, there was a competitive environment. We try to maintain our practices in what we would do and so we don\u2019t really participate in a lot of that. I would say now what we\u2019re seeing is it\u2019s probably lightened up and it\u2019s probably back to a normal level. There are some people out there that are probably a little more competitive than others, but from our perspective, we\u2019re back to a normal yielding process.","Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. And when you guys talk about down slightly on the RevPAR metric in the third quarter, should we expect to see most of that on the occupancy side and maybe be able to hold some rates or would you look at that the other way? Thanks.","Corey Sanders","Yeah Carlo, that will probably be a combination. I think when you look at last year\u2019s third quarter with a higher mix in convention, we ran pretty high occupancies in the third quarter. So I think it\u2019ll be a little bit of a combination of both in the quarter.","Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks guys.","Jim Murren","And from our perspective, I mean we can make our RevPAR go up by just having our rates higher. We maximize EBITDA and we\u2019re going to maximize occupancy at the highest rate we could get. And therefore that\u2019s the result we\u2019re going to see in the third quarter. We prefer to have as much cash flow in our buildings as possible.","Carlo Santarelli \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jon Oh from CLSA.","Jon Oh \u2013 CLSA","Hi. Thanks and morning. I have two questions. I\u2019ll start off with, if you could give us some trends or any color on the high-end Chinese baccarat segment in Vegas?","Corey Sanders","Well, it\u2019s been consistently up. I would say in the second quarter for the MGM Resorts companies including ARIA, we had the largest drop and we didn\u2019t hold as well, but we have the largest drop that we\u2019ve seen in the history of the company in the second quarter on the international side.","Jon Oh \u2013 CLSA","And just a follow-up for \u2013 maybe for Dan. Could you give us some insights into your receivables exposure in Macau? What\u2019s the outstanding amount of receivables that you have right now? How much have you provided for and also some sense on the aging of the accounts that would be useful to us? Thank you.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Well, maybe I\u2019ll turn that over to Grant, but we feel pretty comfortable with where we\u2019re at in terms of our allowances and where the receivables are. Grant, do you have the details in front of you?","Grant Bowie","I do. So as of the June 30 balance, the balance was in Hong Kong dollars this is, because I\u2019m looking at the Hong Kong dollar accounts, so forgive me. So it\u2019s HK$809 million. That\u2019s about \u2013 less than $100 million U.S. and we\u2019ve reserved about $200 million against that. We\u2019re actually pretty conservative with that reserving strategy. And so, I think we\u2019re \u2013 in a net position, we\u2019re in pretty good shape. We\u2019re slightly ahead of where we were last year, but really nothing significant. It\u2019s less than 10% ahead of where we were in terms of total receivables outstanding.","Jon Oh \u2013 CLSA","And Grant, if I can just ask you a little more details on that, based on the HK$809 million receivables, could you give us some indication as to how much of that is advance commission to junkets versus your direct VIP program?","Grant Bowie","The advances to the junkets is about \u2013 let me just check that. It represents about 60% of that, 70%.","Jon Oh \u2013 CLSA","Okay. Thank you.","Grant Bowie","Okay. And on that basis just when you talk about junkets, we liquidate that amount every month. So that gets cleared every month, so that rolls.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dennis Forst from KeyBanc.","Dennis Forst \u2013 KeyBanc","Yeah, good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask Grant a question about the table games in China. I think your first comments were how there\u2019s strength in the mass tables and your direct roll was up, then you talked about a Level 2 expansion, actually adding more VIP tables which kind of contradicts where the strength\u2019s been and where everybody\u2019s going towards the mass. Can you just flesh that out for me, Grant?","Grant Bowie","Well, I think it\u2019s important that we actually build on a portfolio. So when I say we\u2019re building out Level 2, that\u2019s not at the exclusion of the mass market. We continue in the main floor to actually upgrade all the time. What we\u2019re doing on Level 2 and I think we\u2019ve discussed it for sometime is that the \u2013 we really need to maximize our productivity and our availability to bring in multiple operators into the environment.","And so what we\u2019re now starting to see is that we have the large junket operators, what we\u2019re now wanting to position ourselves for is to be able to add greater number of high quality what euphemistically might be called a Tier 2 operator, which is slightly smaller. And so what we\u2019re really doing is reorganizing the real estate, making sure we have the right tables and the right configurations in the right places such that we can have the maximum number of independent operators providing us the greatest depth. And as we all know generating the maximum volume, we can to get that \u2013 to get as much of the volatility out as we can.","Dennis Forst \u2013 KeyBanc","So the...?","Grant Bowie","So, even though the market \u2013 even though the growth rates are slowing and what we still have to do is make sure that in this competitive marketplace, we provide the most attractive, the best facilities we can to get more than our share of that pie.","Dennis Forst \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay, and if you used every table you had available, would it \u2013 what number would it be? I think you\u2019re at 426 right now. Is that the most you can use?","Grant Bowie","We got 427. The 426 simply identifies that 426 units have operated at some time during the period. We still in terms of yield and managing and spreading the tables, have the capacity to reconfigure and that\u2019s what I mean about building different space configurations.","So making sure that we don\u2019t waste any tables that are not performing at their floor average. And so taking tables out of say a six-table configuration moving it into say combinations of double table private rooms, single table private rooms. So we still got some room to go in terms of getting more value out of the 427 tables that we have.","Dennis Forst \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay, terrific. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America",", good morning. I just wanted to go back to the group business in Vegas, real quickly. So, I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about, for last year, roughly 15% of your business was group and convention mix and then I think this year, the target was to probably be more like 15.5%. So the question is, with some of the more kind of in the quarter, for the quarter softness, is that \u2013 kind of is that 15.5% still the target for this year or do you think that number\u2019s a little lower? And then what do you think that number is for next year?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Well, I think Shaun \u2013 this is Dan. We did just about, just inside of 15% mix last year. I think exactly we were at like 14.7%, and we\u2019re hoping to do a little bit better than that this year around the 15% level. I think right now, based on the in the year, for the year, we\u2019re kind of pacing around 14% to 15%. By no means are we giving up. The team\u2019s working hard to continue to build in that, in the year, for the year. So, I think right now, we\u2019re continuing to pace at about a 14% to 15% level.","Bobby Baldwin","And we\u2019re replacing that business, we\u2019re replacing that with leisure business. So, we\u2019re able to fill the rooms but with other channels.","Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, the second question was just going back to the kind of the softness that you saw. As we dig down there, did you see a little bit more on \u2013 just trying to kind of understand, did you see it a little bit more on the gaming side or on some of the non-gaming spend, because I think, Jim, you mentioned that the, outside the room spending, entertainment, and some of that stuff was actually still up. So was it actually that you saw that core mid-tier customer just gambling a little less? Just trying to kind of understand the customer behavior a little bit.","Jim Murren","Yeah, gambling was a little bit, not \u2013 it was very little, very little impact. Entertainment was impacted. Retail was impacted at the core properties. And really what wasn\u2019t impacted were the nightclubs and day clubs which had record revenue numbers.","Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. And my last question would just be for Grant. Grant, the EBITDA margins in Macau were exceptional this quarter and I\u2019m just trying to think through, as we \u2013 kind of the hold normalization will be a piece of it, but trying to kind of understand \u2013 I mean you guys probably benefited from mass market kind of mix shift. So just kind of your thoughts on the sustainability of that margin going forward as you kind of ramp up the direct \u2013 your direct business and the mass business would be helpful?","Grant Bowie","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really changed our proposition. We\u2019re still saying mid to upper 20%s. I think this period was probably a pretty good indicator of sort of the upper quartile, but I still say that it\u2019s in that mid to upper 20%s. So, I think I\u2019m still really comfortable. And the more \u2013 you correctly say the more we can get the main flow of mass market mix working for us, certainly the bigger advantage it has for us.","Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. Thank you very much.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","And Mackenzie, we\u2019re coming on the top of the hour. So, we\u2019ll take one more question from the group.","Operator","And your last question comes from Susan Berliner from JPMorgan.","Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good morning. I had two questions. One was I was wondering if you could talk about the managed and other because it showed a nice pick-up there, and I was wondering how we should think about that going forward?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","I think when you look at it there, Sue, I mean on the cash flow side, it obviously benefited from a full quarter of our share of the IPC out of Macau and that was offset a little bit by some expenses there. So most of the increase was a result of the full quarter of our share of the IPC out of Macau.","Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, great. And Dan, just I guess going forward with regards to \u2013 I know you\u2019re looking to refinance some expensive debt, use of free cash flow to pay down debt. How should we think about, I guess, for modeling purposes going forward the Macau dividends as well as what\u2019s remaining in the Borgata account?","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Well, I think as it relates to the Borgata account, we get and do have the ability to use some of those funds for debt repayment and debt service and we\u2019ve done that. I think that accounts \u2013 it\u2019s around $160-ish million today in that trust account and that will run its course over the agreement we have there.","As far as dividends out of Macau, that\u2019ll be something the board will sit down and contemplate from time to time much like it did earlier this year and will obviously factor in not only the performance where the balance sheet is and the cash position of Macau, but also going forward where we\u2019re at in our Cotai development and other growth opportunities.","And I think as you look out and look at the facility we\u2019re putting together, the cash flow potential of MGM Macau, I think there\u2019ll be a variety of opportunities for that port to consider going forward and that will include the opportunity to continue to return cash to shareholders. So that\u2019ll be something that that board will consider from time to time, but the opportunity will be there.","Susan Berliner \u2013 JPMorgan","Great. Thank you.","Dan D\u2019Arrigo","Thank you everyone for joining and we\u2019ll be around all day for any follow-up questions.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bobby Baldwin, Chief Design and Construction Officer of MGM Resorts International and President and CEO of CityCenter; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings, Limited. [Operator Instructions]","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com, and a replay of the call will be made available on our company website. This morning, we furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC, as well. And before turning over to Jim, I'd like to read the Safe Harbor disclosure. So on this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release which is available on our website.","Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to say that today, we reported a very solid second quarter. Our EBITDA was up by 9%, led by a broad-based recovery here on the Las Vegas Strip, where our cash flows were up 15%. Grant will get into this in a moment but MGM China, we're very proud to say, had yet another record quarter, a tremendous growth there in that market.","And we've been busy on our strategic plans. We've set out on these calls many of our goals and I'm happy to say we're executing on them. The targeted capital here in Las Vegas is yielding very strong results. The room upgrades and food and beverage offerings at MGM and Bellagio are obviously yielding higher cash flows. And I think you'll see Mandalay Bay to be the next beneficiary of this. We recently opened a new nightclub and a day club, and debuted the Michael Jackson One show, that is doing great. The occupancies are as strong as O and people love the show and it's doing extraordinarily well for our food and beverage and gaming, as well.","Down the road, as you know, at that compound, we're going to have the Delano there, which will replace the hotel at Mandalay Bay, which we think will continue to drive higher revenue and cash flows at Mandalay.","Next year, we'll see quite a bit of growth, we think, at New York-New York and Monte Carlo because they'll both benefit from the capital we're spending this year to significantly upgrade their food and beverage offerings and retail offerings and their street frontage.","Our M life customer loyalty program is working. We've seen significant growth in our database, and that has yielded higher bookings in our rooms. And our partnerships are also leading to room growth. The recent ones with Southwest Airlines and Hyatt have been particularly impactful.","On the development front, our second property in Macau is well underway, a bunch of us were there just last week, and we came away very, very pleased with the progress. Excavation is largely completed, and we are well over halfway done with our deep piles and, if anything, we're nicely ahead of schedule. We picked our architect quite a while ago. I don't know if we've disclosed that, but I can now, it's KPF. KPF is the designer of the Mandarin here in Las Vegas, which we're very proud of, and One Central in Macau. They've been progressing with our other designs -- designers and architects on the exteriors and interiors and, again, we're ahead of plan there as well.","I could tell you some of the features of MGM Cotai will include a tremendous atrium. In fact, that will be about 3x the size of the one we have here at Bellagio, and it's already being programmed with pretty special retail, food and beverage and we have some good surprises on the entertainment front as well.","We are also going to be building a mansion in that property. Many of you know the mansion that we have here in Las Vegas. If you don't know it, it's probably because you weren't invited. It's within the MGM Grand here. It's our most popular destination for our Asian customers, it's really spectacular and we are to develop one we think will set the bar even higher in Cotai. The mansion in the MGM Cotai will be really over the top.","Grant has done a good job, I have to say, on the operating team and working with our development team, which is led by Ken Rosevear and Hunter Clayton. They have quite an operation going on the ground in Macau to rapidly get this beautiful property to get to conclusion.","Back here in the U.S., as you know, we submitted a proposal for a destination resort at National Harbor, that's in Prince George's County, Maryland. We did that in May. The Location Commission is in the midst of its review process and is expected to announce a date for public presentations. We think those presentations will happen in either late September or October. They've indicated a final decision is still expected by year end. We're extremely excited about this opportunity and feel like we have the winning proposal.","In Massachusetts, we had a big win with the special election in Springfield to approve the host city agreement. Now the company is finalizing the details of our RFP response, which is due by the end of this year. We think we can play a major role in the revitalization of that city in Western Mass., and we look forward to delivering a very comprehensive proposal to the state. The state's indicated that, that final decision is expected around April of next year.","On the international front, we've been very active in Japan, just to remind people of that. We've been meeting with a lot of stakeholders there over the last few years and we are actively pursuing that.","There's a growing consensus there that gaming will be expanded and we plan to participate in that process. I think our operating and development expertise as well as our ability to be good partners, I think, are great advantages for us.","And in Korea, you may know the government is considering legislation to permit integrated resorts. We've been working with other gaming companies and engaged with the market there. And I think, also there, the view is becoming more favorable, so we'll have to see. But that is potentially, again, a very large opportunity.","I just have to say that we're proud of how we're doing, and we're off to a good start for this year, and I think the best is yet to come. And I'll turn it over to the Dan.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thanks Jim. Our strong second quarter results were led by increased margins at our wholly-owned domestic resorts, which increased by over 150 basis points year-over-year, driven by a 250 basis points increase at our Strip properties. In fact, we're able to maintain our margins on a sequential basis as well on the Strip, which is pretty impressive given the whole dynamic on our table games play.","Our regional properties remain best-in-class and market share leaders, but these markets remain highly competitive and increasingly crowded. With that in mind, we continue to believe that the growth in Las Vegas will outperform our existing regional markets for the foreseeable future.","We truly have the best revenue yield management team and, thanks to them, we're able to drive our ADR up over 2% in the quarter and increase our occupancy despite having roughly over 70,000 more room nights available this quarter than last year as the room remodel at the MGM Grand was in full force in the second quarter last year, and those rooms now are fully back online.","Convention trends for 2013 remain in line with our expectations that we had coming into the year. Our second quarter convention mix increased slightly and our rate grew mid single-digits. We continue to see moderate growth in convention room nights going into the third quarter and, based on that, along with some solid retail booking trends we're seeing, we expect REVPAR in the third quarter to be up 3%.","From a productivity standpoint, the team is doing an outstanding job. The second quarter was our highest Strip convention room nights booking quarter for future dates. Importantly, the composition of those future bookings is impressive with over 50% of those convention room nights booked in the second quarter coming from corporate business. That's pretty important, as you all know, because that is the most profitable segment in the convention room nights, and 2014 and beyond are getting stronger by the day. These strong sales trends are a solid indicator for our business in 2014 and going forward, and our 14-pace remains up double-digits.","Recall in March of 2014, we have CON\/AGG, big citywide convention back in Las Vegas, some 150,000 attendees usually show up for that show. They come in every 3 years, they're a great event for the entire town, that's one of the key drivers to pace next year. But looking beyond that, we're seeing significant pace increases in each of the second, third and fourth quarter next year. In fact, we're up at least high single-digits each quarter next year when you're looking at the non-CON\/AGG piece of the business. So we're pretty excited about the pace of 2014 and the traction that we continue to make in the important segment of our room booking pace on the convention and meeting side.","","Looking at the balance sheet and helping with some of your modeling. We currently have over $1 billion of available liquidity on our corporate revolver and some excess cash as well. Excluding MGM China, our current debt is approximately $12.6 billion. At the end of the second quarter, MGM China had cash of approximately $840 million and debt of $553 million. And as you saw in the release this morning, MGM China announced its first semi-annual dividend as part of its regular dividend policy. They declared a dividend of roughly $113 million, of which $57 million will be distributed to MGM Resorts and approximately $55 million to all other shareholders on\/or about September 2. As we stated before, the MGM China Board will also continue to consider special dividends from time to time as well as the annual dividend policy. In total, MGM China has distributed $312 million in dividends to MGM Resorts this year alone. CityCenter currently has approximately $1.85 billion in outstanding senior notes and excess cash of approximately $365 million, and they also have about $72 million remaining in the condo proceeds account.","Our second quarter CapEx at our wholly-owned resorts was approximately $65 million, and our full year CapEx for MGM Resorts wholly-owned properties remains unchanged at roughly $350 million. Our corporate expense in the quarter came in slightly above our guidance, primarily due to our ongoing development initiatives in Maryland and Massachusetts. We expect corporate expense to be in the range of $45 million to $50 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Our stock compensation is estimated to be approximately $6 million to $7 million in the third quarter and depreciation expense is estimated to be consistent with the second quarter.","Following the repricing of our term loan this past May, we also had a step-down in pricing on our revolver in our Term Loan A along with the step-down in pricing at MGM China's credit facility. We estimate that our gross interest expense for the third quarter will be approximately $210 million, including about $5 million from MGM China and about $9 million in noncash amortization.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Bobby to talk about CityCenter.","Robert H. Baldwin","Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone.","ARIA's EBITDA was $50 million, a decrease of $6 million or 11% year-over-year, as it was negatively impacted by approximately $10 million in whole when compared to the 24-month average whole percentage.","Our hotel business continues to improve due to greater brand awareness and increased convention room nights. This was our best REVPAR quarter ever at $194.","Our best-in-class convention facility continues to drive bookings, as we had our highest future convention bookings quarter since opening. These future bookings are solidifying our convention base over the next several years.","Our food and beverage profit is growing, driven by strength in catering for conventions and the increasing popularity of our fine dining restaurants. We recently welcomed Five50, a pizza restaurant by James Beard award-winning Chef, Shawn McClain, which opened July 4. Five50 is a great casual addition to the restaurant offerings at ARIA and the public's initial reaction has been extremely positive.","If you've been to Las Vegas Strip lately, you'll notice our 250-foot LED marquee sign on Las Vegas Boulevard, which made its debut in mid-April and is the largest digital screen on the Las Vegas Strip. The marquee increases our brand visibility, promotes ARIA's restaurant collection, our M life rewards programs, Crystals retail outlets and features customized welcome messages for our large convention groups. This marquee is a game-changing symbol for marketing on the Strip, and it's captivating pedestrians from both north and south ends of Las Vegas Boulevard.","I would like to also highlight that Crystals had its best quarter ever, up 21% year-over-year, and we continue to add tenants as our second Starbucks is now open and we recently executed 2 additional leases. As the real estate market in Las Vegas continues to improve, and we are seeing increased sales for our Las Vegas CityCenter condos.","During the quarter, we sold 45 units at Mandarin Oriental and 7 units at Veer, for a total of $54 million of proceeds. In July, we sold another 21 units at Mandarin Oriental.","And that concludes my report. I'll turn it over to you, Grant.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Bobby. For the second quarter, MGM China net revenues increased 18% to $835 million and generated an all-time record EBITDA around $205 million, and that was up 10% year-over-year. This number includes a branding fee of $15 million.","Our strong results was driven by record performance in both the VIP and our main floor gaming table segments where our growth outpaced the market.","The VIP turnover reached another property record with approximately 34% growth year-over-year and we continue to see success from the addition of our 2 second-floor VIP area and the introduction of a new operator in mid-April. Our overall VIP win for the quarter was approximately 2.9%, and that was versus 3.3% for the prior year.","We also had a record main floor table games quarter. We're able to drive main floor table game volumes up 11% and revenue up 29% year-over-year with our continued focus on table yield management and strategically targeting the premium segment. Slot handle increased by 11% during the quarter and we remain the market leader for single property in terms of slot gross gaming revenues.","During the second quarter, our total CapEx was $80 million. Our MGM total expenditures were approximately $78 million during the second quarter. We expect our full year totalized spend to be approximately $290 million.","Our overall budget remains unchanged at $2.6 billion for MGM Cotai, excluding land and capitalized interest. And based on our progress to that, we are now anticipating an early 2016 opening.","At MGM Macau, we expect to spend approximately $56 million in 2013. We believe our continuous upgrade of our product on offer is one of the keys to remain competitive in this market. And during the third quarter, both our high-limit slot room and our Las Vegas table games room will be temporarily off-line for refurbishment. And with that, I'd like to turn back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren","Thank you, Grant. Thanks for being up so late. Well, before we get to the questions, just a couple of final points. Clearly, we see here in Las Vegas a continuation of the recovery. Housing in general in the U.S. obviously is improving, so is the case here in Las Vegas. That's important to our business. We've talked about that before, but we see a great correlation between housing and our core business.","Airline carriers are starting to add more seats to Las Vegas, it's really important to the entire market, important to us. Flight capacities are trending higher, and that means domestic and international carriers are adding planes.","We've been working with the LVCVA to increase international visitation in particular. And as you know, the extreme growth in South America has benefited many U.S. cities, beginning to benefit Las Vegas. Copa Airlines are bringing in more flights from Brazil, as a matter of fact, through Panama City to Las Vegas, so that's a big deal for us.","Las Vegas recovery, I think, will be felt more by us. Our market share is growing in this market, as we strategically add the capital to upgrade the rooms, add the F&B, add the entertainment.","By the way, on the entertainment front, next month, we're going to have one of the biggest fights in the history of Las Vegas, the Mayweather-Canelo Alvarez fight. It's going to set all kinds of records in terms of at the gate, in closed circuit. And we're hosting many parties at our venues closed circuit. So up and down the Strip, quite a bit of activity in September.","September ends with the I Heart Music Festival, that's another big event for the city and for ourselves, of course, at the MGM Grand. And for the first time, we're also going to have an outdoor concert in the Festival Grounds we just literally finished across from Luxor. I mention that because the way to drive more productivity in these buildings, we believe, is to continue to create excitement, relatively low cost ways. Festival Grounds don't cost a lot of money to build, but they generate a lot of traffic and, of course, a lot of traffic in the neighborhood, and we own most of the neighborhood.","I think that you'll find as we move to the balance of this year and into next year, continued targeted capital, which we believe will continue to build our share of this market.","Revenues is, obviously, growing for us, and we've been watching cost, as Dan mentioned, very aggressively. Margin expansion is the result. Free cash flow is growing, and we reduced the debt by almost $0.5 billion. And of course, our objective is clear: to drive cash flows, improve our balance sheet. We think that's the surest way to work for our owners.","And so with that, we can turn over to the operator, please, for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dan, Jim, the group trends that you talked about for 2014 are encouraging, particularly in relation to what all of us are hearing from some of the traditional hotel companies, look no further than Ryman this morning. Why do you think the Strip is experiencing positive pace whereas maybe the traditional hotel industry is not? And maybe you can kind of talk about it in the context of in the year, for the year, how important or critical that is for you to kind of get to these mix levels as a percentage of room nights?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","I think, Joe, I'll start. And I think the key is the Las Vegas market, from a composition standpoint, is much different. Coming in to given year, we have roughly about 80% to 90% of our contracted room nights on the books and solid going into a given year. So we don't rely on as much in the year, for the year. That really helps us fill up the rest of that, call it 15% to 20% level of the room nights and allows us to kind of offset attrition throughout the year. So I think when you look at this market vis-\u00e0-vis some of the other hotel markets, they rely a lot more on in the year, for the year and in this market, it's less reliant on it. And I think that's probably the biggest factor.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, Dan, I'll just add that the trade show component of Las Vegas has held up really well, I mean, in fact, it has grown. What Las Vegas got hurt by was the corporate business and the incentive business. That's still down dramatically from where it was in '07. And of course, that business is the highest margin business in the group sales side. And what's most encouraging about the number that Dan cited in terms of our bookings is that, 51%, Corey? 51% of what we booked lately is in the corporate and incentive side. So not only are the bookings improving, but the weakest part of the business, which is the highest margin part, we're starting to see significant growth. And I was thinking of a couple of groups, I can't mention the names, but the big conventions in the incentive side and corporate side that left us in '07, started doing virtual conferences, and now they've just booked multi-year deals with a lot of revenue. So I think it's not only the in the year, for the year, which is not as important to us, as Dan mentioned, but the composition of the rooms that we're booking now give us a lot more pricing flexibility going forward.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then the next question, my final question is, there was a recent media report on efforts to market for sale Crystals. I was hoping you can just talk about that broadly.","James Joseph Murren","Sure, I'll tackle that one. I saw that in the Wall Street Journal. We've gotten, over the year, I don't know, 3 or 4 different inquiries about selling Crystals as retail become hot again and cap rates have fallen. And so, we felt like we need to respond to that. And we have been doing some exploratory work on that. And all I could say is that the interest is high, but also the value of Crystals is high to us. And so, I can't say what's going to happen there specifically, but for the fact that cap rates are still pretty low, which means multiples for assets like that are dramatically higher than what we're getting credit for in the marketplace. We recognize that big valuation discrepancy and we're taking a look at that, but I can't tell you how that's going to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura Securities.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first is your margin continued to surprise on the upside. Can you talk about what you're doing on the cost side, both on the casino and non-casino side that is making a difference and its sustainability as we look into 2014?","James Joseph Murren","Maybe I'll do 2 and then turn it over to you, Dan, or Corey.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Sure.","James Joseph Murren","I think we mentioned a few calls ago, we moved Anton Nikodemus over from Monte Carlo to head up Casino Marketing. He's put together quite a program, a great program with all our marketing folks, and we have found tremendous opportunities to be less wasteful in our -- some of our promotional activity. And so on the casino side, it's been really a function of being smarter on our promotional activity, being more targeted to our best customers, being more thoughtful in how we're marketing broadly, and M life is certainly helping quite a bit in that -- on that front. And I think on the non-gaming side, I'd have to point to room remodels, it's -- they don't sound sexy, but sure -- they sure generate a lot of cash flow, incremental. And when you upgrade rooms like we have done here at Bellagio and MGM and also some of this new food and beverage offerings, which are very high ROI projects, I think you're seeing a better mix of people in the rooms, which generates more gaming and non-gaming revenue, which improves margins. On the cost side, our FTEs are just flat year-over-year, continue to manage all of our costs and we've -- Rick Arpin and his team have done a great job on our financials shared services department and other ways of being more clever internally on how we manage this business more efficiently. And again, Dan or...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","No.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, then moving on. Moving on to my second question, it's related to your alliance on the third party travel providers, the vendors. Have you begun to see any improved ability to actually control more of your room blocks? And if so, to what degree is it moving the needle? And when you replace a customer that comes in through a third party vendor with one of your own that has been sourced, what is the differential in the value per customer per room?","Corey I. Sanders","Harry, it's Corey. With regards to the third party operators, we have been able to move some of it. We're focused on it with, not only our M life, but our myVegas game has actually been able to convert some people into the FIT channels. That channel has grown and will continue to grow because a lot of the international customers are booking through Expedia and booking.com. So our goal is how we maximize that channel and how we put it into our mix and yield our rooms up the best we can. We will constantly have strategies to try to shift that channel as much as we can but, right now, it's at excellent pace, it's a good block for us to be able to yield our rates upwards. From a comparison of customers and the value of those customers, the lines have blurred from an FIT and leisure customer over the years. I would say the FIT customer does have a little bit more value, but we're seeing that value come to a little bit closer to the leisure customer.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Do you get the sense -- as a follow-up, do you get the sense that the international customers that you're booking, do they come with bigger wallets? Are they spending more on food and beverage and entertainment and in the casino?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. And not only that, the survey information from the LVCVA will back that up also. They'll come a few extra nights, probably a little bit less in the casino and more on the entertainment and food and beverage venues that they're spending, but they're probably worth about 15% to 20% more than the domestic leisure customers.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of David Bain with Sterne Agee.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just following up on the Crystals discussion. Obviously, a sale could lead to a potential dividend to MGM. But could you also look to use those proceeds to potentially consolidate CityCenter? And then can we get an update on CityCenter refi, just given the strong performance in 2Q in the credit market?","James Joseph Murren","Well, I don't know how much we'll answer on that one, but you want to start on the refi, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. I mean, clearly, David, there's an opportunity as CityCenter has been ramping up its cash flows and its operation. Its -- net debt, it's kind of in the $1.5 billion range and its trailing 12-month EBITDA is just inside of $300 million in cash flows. So the clear profile of CityCenter is improving. The cost structure on the debt side today is pretty expensive, that first call date through January of 2014 on the notes, and that will be an undertaking that the partners will start looking at here in the back half of the year and early next year from a refi perspective.","James Joseph Murren","And I guess, the only thing I'd add to that is so many of the challenges we had at the end of '09 and 2010, residential inventory that we could not sell, hotel condo that we couldn't sell as hotel condo, Crystals not being occupied well, Mandarin not having any sea legs underneath it, almost all of those challenges we've met and we've overcome. Residential story is now a positive one. Instead of having an anvil around our neck, which seem like we had for many years, it's an asset, not a liability. Crystals is doing better literally every month. The hotel condo, which is Vdara, is actually making a decent amount of money for us. And so both partners, I feel I could speak for our side, are very pleased with the progress of CityCenter. And that's all I would say about it at this point.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 more. Not to get picky, just given the solid broad base margin performance in Vegas, but the one we're expecting to see a little bit more flow-through on was the Grand, given the non-gaming adds, can you speak to that one a little bit? How we should we view it going forward?","James Joseph Murren","Well, I think, it was up -- what was it up, 7%? I think there are a few things -- I think it was pretty good. But expect more because if you've been in it lately, obviously, Hakkasan has been a tremendous revenue generator. But there's going to be quite a bit more work done in that area. The space that used to occupy sleeping lions in the Lion Habitat is going to be redone into food and beverage venue. I don't think we've announced that yet, but that will be a big deal there. And that whole corner is going to be significantly upgraded as we open that up to the Strip. I think that's going to have a big impact on the Grand. And the other is -- in next year, in particular, citywide -- I don't think we talked to much about it, but the citywides are going to have a significant impact on properties like the Grand being more business in the city next year will benefit those big box properties like MGM.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And I think when you look at it, I mean, their performance year-over-year is up some 70% in terms of cash flow. When you look at the -- that flow-through, I mean that's about 80% in terms of flow-through when you look at the results. So I think it's pretty impressive by the Grand.","David Bain - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. My bad, I was looking sequentially. Anyway, the -- Grant, I just had one question for you. We've heard some chatter on the air quality test results and that may be followed by a debate in the assembly surrounding smoking regs. Can you give us any thoughts on how that plays out?","Grant R. Bowie","On the process it's going forward, we have a -- the government continues to test and we continue to test ourselves. And in reality, the process is, I guess, working itself through in terms of how the government perceives people's commitment to improving air quality. Obviously, we have invested significantly and we'll continue to do that to ensure that we provide the best environment that we possibly can. So it's an evolving process. I think all of these health and safety initiatives are an ongoing -- a progressive thing, and that's -- and we, obviously, just staying as close as we can and working with the government and with the other operators to try and make sure we have the best environment we can.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Kelly Knybel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Kelly filling in. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color on the rates that you guys are seeing in your 2014 convention business that you have on the books right now?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","It's pacing right now, up about mid single-digits right now in terms of its pace.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Grant Govertsen with Union Gaming Macau.","Grant Govertsen","I've got a couple for Grant in Macau. Grant, in your prepared remarks, you're highlighting premium as one of the key drivers of the mass floor. I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on growth rates between premium and mass mass at the property?","Grant R. Bowie","It's a little bit difficult for us to do that because we are such a strong performer in the premium side in terms of -- and the way we allocate the capacity. But from our perspective, it's pretty consistent across the breadth of the play through the categories. And as I say, we really don't really penetrate into the deep mass mass. We -- I think we've -- you and I have discussed together, we really are a mid- to upper-mass operator. So with what I see coming through to some of the other operators that are into that area, it seems to be pretty strong right across the mass segments.","Grant Govertsen","Okay great. And then just a follow-up, and not to sound too nitpicky, but on the -- on your slot floor, the sequential decline of about 8% from the first quarter, could you just remind us, was there some anomaly in the first quarter that caused a spike and then a little trail off in handle into the second quarter?","Grant R. Bowie","I think it's fair to say in that first period, we had some exceptionally high performances at the very top end of the market, and a couple of those -- we've lost a couple of visits as a result of that. So I think that's something of an anomaly from the prior quarter and a strength to the prior quarter. But the strength of the price across the range now is actually very pleasing, but it's not just limited to the very top end, it's actually coming across the product range. And we've also been doing some refurbishments and that's meant -- we'd be moving some machines around, so we actually lost some capacity -- we lost some units off the floor for a little period of time as we are moving that through. So it's not really apples-for-apples in terms of absolute number of units and revenue per unit per day calculation either.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, on your luxury side, you obviously did well this quarter with nice flow-through. You've talked about that a lot. So just wondering, we're also starting to see some improvement out of your retail or core properties, I'm just wondering if you can just discuss what you're seeing there.","James Joseph Murren","Sure. We did have some growth in the second quarter, it was minimal, but it was growth. I think that it's a combination of two things. One is as the luxuries are lifting off, but not only ourselves but our competitors, we're able to draft the core properties off to luxuries. And so you're seeing some of that occur, although I don't frankly think it's going to happen significantly until next year, and I'll get to that in a second. And the second is a few of the properties have had nice shots of excitement. Obviously, Monte Carlo is doing significantly better, it's got a new show, it's got some F&B; Luxor, the same thing, with a new show. And so some, I think some of the core properties have benefited from that. I really am not expecting a significant amount of growth. I shouldn't say this because the property president is probably listening in, but I'm not expecting too much growth out of the core this year. I do expect a significant increase in cash flows next year at those properties because what we're doing at New York-New York and Monte Carlo and because of the citywides, which will most benefit those properties.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then if you just -- and then just, I know your overall hold on the Strip was just in the normal range, but were there any properties that either held well or poorly that you could discuss outside of ARIA?","James Joseph Murren","Well, Mirage held poorly again.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes. Mirage was high single-digits last year, and they beat that by just barely going into double-digits this year. Bellagio was actually down year-over-year and the Grand was up a little bit. So despite the strong performance at Bellagio, their hold was still outside of what I would say would be in their normal range.","James Joseph Murren","And then -- and really, the only outlier was Mirage being 10%, basically.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last question. Grant, you mentioned that there's going to be some disruption in your high limit flat room in the Las Vegas table games rooms. So I was just wondering how we should think about that disruption over the next period from that being off-line?","Grant R. Bowie","I guess I'm just telegraphing it, but frankly, I don't expect it to have an overall negative impact over the whole half because we -- obviously, with the refurbishment, we expect to see a pickup in the win rates coming out. So I think it may have some impact and we're just indicating that, but I don't think that it's going to have anything detrimental over the entire half. It might move some business between the third quarter to the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could start by maybe talking about the gaming side. Maybe a little bit more big picture in Vegas, but it does look, relative to the market, that your volume numbers were pretty good on both tables and slots, so it seems like you're picking up some share. Could you talk about, is it M life or kind of what do you think is driving that? Is it disruption from across the street or just kind of what you think some of the drivers are behind that?","James Joseph Murren","Well, slots side, definitely, M life is helped quite a bit. The international, it's still strong. I mean, I think our competitors saw that as well. We certainly did at our luxury properties. The domestic side was the weak part in '11 and '12. That's even getting a little bit better. So I would say, the higher end properties or the quality properties within different price points are seeing a little bit more than their fair share. I know our fair share is growing, but I think the market is lifting in general. And so I would expect that the other properties that don't break out specifically their cash flows like we do, probably also have seen that kind of -- they should've seen that kind of improvement. We're definitely seeing it. And I -- what's most gratifying, I think, because international business has been strong even during the recession, it was the only bright spot. What's most gratifying for us is continued growth in our slot business. That was an area where we felt, in self-reflection, we were weaker than we should have been and I don't think we were smart as we could have been on slot marketing, on loyalty marketing. That is definitely yielding higher revenues for us. And then we can't take credit for a U.S. recovery, but we can be a beneficiary of it. And we're seeing that in our domestic table play.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then maybe one for Dan, just on CapEx. But as we look at where you're at kind of through the first half and compare it to the $350 million budget, it looks like you're actually meaningfully below that. So we were just kind of wondering, do you expect a pickup in spending? Is that related more to the some of the activity at New York-New York and Monte Carlo or is spending -- the spending picked up for the arena project or is there something else?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","It is a little back-half-of-the-year-loaded because you do have the ongoing projects at Monte Carlo and New York-New York that are in the back half of the year just getting started here in June and July, so those will pick up through the course of the year. And we aim to complete those early next year as those start coming online. And you do have the Delano room remodel project that will start late this year, probably looking at November, December time frame, and for completion by kind of April of next year. So there are some big-ticket items in the back half of the year that's throw off kind of the spending trend.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And just maybe one more -- maybe just one in CapEx for Cotai, but do you guys have a sense of the budget including the $2.6 billion excludes land concession, cap interest and, I imagine, the preopening costs? Do you have a sense for like all in, what the $2.6 billion will be?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Well, the $2.6 billion includes preopening, but it does exclude the land concession and cap interest as that will get squirrely between corporate and the project itself going forward. Grant, do you recall what the total concession payments were? I don't have that in front of me.","Grant R. Bowie","Neither do I because, obviously, I came in over an extended 5-year period as well, so that's why we pulled those out because it's not all paid. We can get back to you on that.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","We'll get that for you, Shaun. Those are public information [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You mentioned earlier your new loyalty partnerships with Hyatt and Southwest Airlines. As we think about your Vegas operations improving going forward, can you give us examples of how such partnerships like these drive heads and beds, pricing power and other revenues? And I have a follow-up.","James Joseph Murren","[indiscernible]?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes, I could take it. The Hyatt and Southwest partnerships, what they allow us to do is take some of that base that may have been even their leisure or going to our competitors and fill them into our FIT channels. And those additional rooms just allow us to yield up our rooms a lot higher. The Hyatt partnership is a perfect partnership for us because their convention business model is very conducive for our business here. So I think that we're seeing some benefit there especially in our luxury properties, it fits nicely there. The Southwest partnership, to be able to get the points, you have to become an M life member. So it allows us to convert some -- and improve our database for M life with these customers that are loyal, not only to Southwest, but they'll become loyal to us. So we've seen some very good lift from both of those partnerships. And in times, especially when it's competitive in the summer, it only helps us gain market share, especially in the core properties on the Southwest side.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then you mentioned earlier that 51% of your recent convention bookings were corporate and incentives, it seems like that's much higher than it's been the past few years. Can you give us a sense of where it was over the past few years?","James Joseph Murren","It's about twice what it was. I mean, in the last few years, it never got over like 25%. That's by far the biggest incremental growth in our booking we've seen in the corporate side. And now, as I said, it's little over half of it.","Corey I. Sanders","Yes. We've lost about 30% of our corporate room nights from peak and we're seeing that beginning to recover.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Baccarat volume in Vegas in the quarter? I mean, the city had it declining which hasn't happened in a little while, and I wonder if you could talk about that. And if that maybe -- was that intentional in terms of cutting back on some Baccarat events and is that part of what helps -- helped in terms of your margins and cost saves in Vegas?","James Joseph Murren","We'll take a look at that, Robin. Do you have that? I'm guessing it was an events-driven difference because I know we had a big fight in that quarter a year ago, but we're looking at that.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I'm just wondering if that was also maybe part of the margin improvement. Was -- if there were some high-end events that weren't as profitable or weren't as high margin, is that kind of what -- so the result was lower volume in Baccarat but higher margin and profitability overall?","James Joseph Murren","No, I don't think that would have been the case. The margin would have been higher if we had more Baccarat business. But the events I was talking about were slot events and some of the lower end table events and some of the mailings, and some of the other promotional activity we do. The Baccarat margins haven't declined, they're actually flat or up a little bit. But I know we had a big -- we had a Mayweather fight in the second quarter, didn't we, last year?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes, we did this year.","Unknown Executive","This year too.","James Joseph Murren","But it wasn't as good...","Corey I. Sanders","No.","Corey I. Sanders","But if you look at -- without ARIA, we actually had more win on the international side in table games play. And for the year, year-to-date, we have had record international win. But ARIA had a little bit of a challenge for the quarter, partially because they held really well last year, and they had some pretty strong play. But I would say the play is still there, maybe 1 or 2 customers that may came in last year, I think -- and this year for the quarter. But the solid base is still there, we're seeing a good volume of people coming in, and I think we're pretty happy with the international number.","Robert H. Baldwin","And the drop at ARIA is up for the 6 months, and so is the win in Baccarat.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It sounds like for the wholly-owned, so Q2, maybe volume was down, win was up but volume was down or something?","Corey I. Sanders","It was slightly down, yes. Yes, it was down.","James Joseph Murren","But win was up.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then for convention rooms as I know you made a couple of comments about 2014. I don't know if you mentioned what room nights, both number of room nights and rates for '13 will end up year-over-year, how you're tracking?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Convention room nights as a percentage of mix, Robin, we're pacing right now for '13, about 14.5% to kind of 15% kind of is the range that we're pacing with [indiscernible] up over last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Coyne with Goldman Sachs.","Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, I was just wondering, how many unsold condos there are at the Veer and Mandarin after the July sale?","Robert H. Baldwin","There are 4 unsold Veer penthouses and 89 units at Mandarin.","Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Just turning to Detroit, obviously, it's been in the headlines with the bankruptcy. And I don't know if anyone really knows how it's going to unfold. But has your business been impacted since the headlines? And where -- what do you think could happen going forward?","Corey I. Sanders","At this point in time, Kevin, we haven't seen any impact. The planners in Detroit from a convention and meeting standpoint are not forecasting any impact at this point to the future business. So right now, in Detroit, other than what we talked about from the competitive nature, it's business as usual in Detroit.","James Joseph Murren","I actually felt it get a little better. Yes.","Kevin Coyne - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And one final one on Internet gaming, just a general update on the rollout in Nevada. And I guess as it relates to that, how is maybe the progress on the relicensing in New Jersey?","Corey I. Sanders","I'll take the relicensing in New Jersey. From that standpoint, Kevin, that process is underway. We made and continue to make the applications and the follow-ups, so which usually about a 9- to 12-month process from that standpoint. Obviously, the folks in New Jersey are busy on their Internet gaming and licensing requirements there, so there's a bandwidth issue, I'm sure back there with everything they're trying to get accomplished on a parallel path. But our relicensing process is underway and we're moving forward on that front.","James Joseph Murren","Yes. And on the Internet side, we have a number of initiatives that are kind of on a parallel path. One is, of course, still federally, we haven't given up hope although it's becoming very challenging there. And on a state-by-state basis, Nevada is moving quite rapidly along. There's already one launched. I think Caesar's is going to be the next they're coming up soon. We've going to be following them, but we've really been focusing on the -- Nevada's ability to compact with other states to create more liquidity and we've been focusing on those other states as well. So we have a big team that is preparing ourselves on a state-by-state basis in the states that we believe would be the most productive for us. And we've been working with the State of Nevada on their efforts to compact with other states. So I think from our standpoint, the opportunity becomes interesting once Nevada has the ability to compact with another state. As a standalone opportunity, there's just not a lot of people that live in our state here. So the market size is relatively small compared to what we think it ultimately will be as more states come online.","Operator","And your last question is from the line of Rich Hightower with ISI Group.","Richard A. Hightower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question on Macau for Grant. Obviously, revenues were up nicely in terms of the mass segment especially, but overall EBITDA margins dropped, it looks like a couple hundred basis points. And I'm just curious, was this a function of lower VIP hold year-over-year? Is there something else going on in terms of promotions and give backs and so forth in the mass segment or some of those other areas?","Grant R. Bowie","The principal reason was actually the mix of revenues. This quarter, we had a lower hold particularly in our in-house play, so it's really just a revenue mix that's affected the margins.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And the other point I'd make, Grant, is that branding fee is actually up year-over-year, so that expense is up year-over-year, and that impacts the margin. But you should look at it pretty that branding fee.","Richard A. Hightower - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, I appreciate it. Then actually, one more question, if I may, just quickly on Las Vegas. It does like FTEs have been flat for the past couple of quarters. But I'm just wondering when we should expect that to round-trip and then show some natural cost inflation going forward again. And then maybe if you could fold in your expectations, your updated expectations on the Affordable Care Act when that kicks in, I'd appreciate it.","James Joseph Murren","FTE, obviously, is full time equivalent, that's the hours worked, so there's no component of wages in that, it's just -- what our headcount is. And that's been basically flat for 3 years, and I expect it to remain that way. We might have some increase in FTE counts as in the banqueting area, in the convention area, particularly as we get into higher citywides in '14, but don't expect -- I don't expect that to grow demonstrably at all. As it [indiscernible] negotiations are going well as they typically have constructive [indiscernible] agreement on a going-forward basis and [indiscernible] on health care as well as it relates to the culinary. On non-union members, we do know that this is going to -- there'll be a cost to us. We haven't quantified internally exactly what it is. It's a few million dollars, it could be $5 million, but it's not more, it's in that kind of range, and it's just something we'll have to absorb. So our costs are pretty low in terms of their inflation growth. Managing our expenses outside of labor is also a big factor here, which we didn't get into, but we're finding great efficiencies in procurement in consolidations, and we've been able to mitigate some wage growth by cost savings in other expense areas. And that's why we believe that, in general, any revenue growth that we get should flow to the bottom line because our costs are pretty flat.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","And I would add, we've been able to manage our health cost, so where they're flat this year. We think we have ways to offset any of that cost increase. So we would expect a little to normal inflation in our health cost going forward.","Thanks, Rich. And Jennifer, I think, with that, that will conclude today's call.","Operator","Thank you very much. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thank you."],"15000":["MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) Q2 2018 Earnings Call August  2, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Daniel J.

Joining the call from the company today are Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Corey Sanders, Chief Operating Officer; Grant Bowie, CEO and Executive Director of MGM China Holdings Limited.","Participants are in listen-only mode. After the company's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please note this event is being recorded.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Kate, and good morning and welcome to the MGM Resorts International second quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com and we have furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On the call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated in these statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC.

You can find the reconciliation of GAAP financial measures in the press release, which is also available on our website.","I'd now turn the call over to Mr. Jim Murren.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Well, first, I want to say we obviously reported solid second quarter results. The strip revenues are up 2%, RevPAR up 2.8%, and that was both consistent with our guidance. Our Las Vegas EBITDA, excluding Park MGM, increased 3% year-over-year and our margins came in a little bit better than expected. They were down 82 basis points. Excluding Park MGM, margins were just about flat at 31%.","We continue to see strong performance at our luxury properties, Bellagio and Aria each produced over $120 million of EBITDA in the quarter and margins were 37% and 38%, respectively, in fact, already had an all-time record EBITDA quarter in the second quarter.","Our regionals again had a solid performance and the star there was our newest property, MGM National Harbor. Over in Macau, MGM China's EBITDA was $120 million in the quarter. Unfortunately, there, we held low in both the main floor and VIP, which negatively impacted results by almost $40 million. We just ended our month of July. Fortunately, we've seen a strong pickup after the World Cup. MGM Macau gross gaming revenues in July were up nearly 20% year-over-year and up over 40% on a month-to-month basis.","And since we opened our beautiful new property in Cotai, our team in Macau has been capturing opportunities in the marketplace. And at the same time, we're fine-tuning our offerings across the whole property portfolio, implementing those new initiatives and strategies to grow and yield our business, which brings us to what's happening soon there. New amenities are coming online in the coming weeks and months to come. MGM Cotai's VIP junket rooms will be opened before October's Golden Week. The Mansion, our high-end room product, is going to open up along with the President's Club, which is an exclusive gaming area for our premium mass customers. They're both expected to debut in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, we have a resident theater show. It's called Destiny and it's going to also be launched later this year.","As always, Grant's on the phone, and he can answer any of your questions. So, that's a good look of the second quarter. Obviously, there's a lot of disclosure. If you have any questions on that, please let us know.","Looking into the third quarter, first, here in Las Vegas, we highlighted, as you recall that \u2013 last call \u2013 that we had some specifically difficult comparisons in the third quarter. That's, of course, due to the fact that citywides and MGM in particular had a very strong convention calendar mix in the third quarter last year. Of course, we had the two fights that we hosted. We also held above our normal range. But we also preview that we're seeing some discrete pockets of rate pressure. That's driven by the lower citywide convention mix.","In May, when we saw you in Investor Day, we knew a lot. We knew that citywide conventions in the market looked what they were going to look like. We knew the third quarter was going to be down over 100,000 room nights in the third quarter. We knew the fourth quarter, however, was going to be up around 77,000 room nights. The idea then or the thought we had was to fill those gaps in the year for the year with some convention business, more so than we had done the prior year. That did not come to fruition.","As you know, summer months are tough, particularly on the convention side, the booking windows are short, and that's the quarter, the third quarter, where we generally have to rely more on leisure channels. And these channels became very competitive over the last couple of months. So, MGM adjusted prices whenever it made sense, and we didn't whenever it did not. We did forego occupancy and have foregone occupancy in properties where we're not going to get our minimum pricing.","I have to say, though, in the other channels we're seeing in this current quarter, the longer-term convention block, our FIT and casino blocks all came in or are coming in as expected. The combination of the comparison and the less than expected in the year for the quarter, small group business means that we believe that our RevPAR in the third quarter will be down here in Las Vegas between 5% and 7%. That would mean our revenues would be down between 8% and 10%.","That would mean that our margins in the third quarter here would come in around 28%. And if you exclude Park MGM, which is dragging our margins, the margins would be around 29%. So, let's size that. About half the EBITDA decrease is simply driven by the tough table games comparison and Park MGM, the rest is mainly driven by the hotel mix shift of this near-term dynamic we're talking about.","Based on what we've been seeing and based on a strong level of conservatism for the balance of the year, we now expect that our strip revenues and EBITDA to be both down low-single-digits and our margins to be around 29% or 30% if you exclude Park MGM. Now, it's early but we're starting to see much better pace trends later part of the fourth quarter, which we can get into, particularly on the group side. And as we look out into 2019, we have been building a very solid base of convention business. In fact, our production in the second quarter for future periods was up double digits looking now, and we also see a very healthy backdrop in driving some of our group destination demand.","As many of you likely know, we've been recently back from New York where we've been busy on sports. And we've made some, I think, very significant advancements. We went into this proposition understanding that MGM Resorts has an opportunity to dominate sports betting in the United States. We have the brands, we have the people, we have the market. What we're looking for in this race to market share was how to best provide the best experience for the gaming customer. We knew we needed to have the best technology, proprietary, scalable. We knew we needed to have outstanding in-game betting experience, which does not exist here in the United States but, of course, it does throughout the world and we needed to have a partner that could help us build this business with a speed to market and we found that partner in GVC. We were proud to announce that joint venture.","We also know that we need to be in every market in which a consumer can gamble on sports in the United States and so we turned to our friends and partners at Boyd Gaming. This provides our platform the opportunity to go in every state that MGM and Boyd operates in. And in states where we do not operate in today, we'll simply do other market access deals with the people that have been calling us.","We also knew that data is everything, and integrity and trust in the data is tantamount to success, which is why we're particularly proud of the unique partnership we just forged with the NBA, where we are now the data receiver and the official gaming sponsor of the NBA and the WNBA. Just launched I think in Mississippi yesterday. Mobile is coming in New Jersey in days, if not hours. And we believe that this market is going to be large going forward and it is a vehicle for a total interactive experience of not only sports betting, poker, casino, social, as it is around the world, and that will help our bricks-and-mortar business.","Before I turn it over to questions, I wanted to just clarify, crystallize the strategies that guide us here at MGM Resorts which, I think, are particularly important to remember in times of short-term market turbulence.","Number one, we have and we will continue to do everything we can to maximize the operating efficiency of all of our existing resorts, regardless of what's going on in the markets. We have the market share leadership everywhere we operate that leads to higher margins than our regional competitors and we're going to maintain that. We're going to continue to drive innovation and transform the guest experience by leveraging what we own \u2013 the best assets in the industry with digital, technology and interactive businesses. Obviously, our activities this week speak to that.","Because our properties are in outstanding condition and better than their peer group, we're going to be able to allocate an increasing mix of our future CapEx to technology over the next few years without changing our overall CapEx spending by $1. The technology investments, we believe, will yield more or higher margin, less capital-intensive cash flows for the portfolio.","MGM Resorts will continue its path to be asset-light, continue the path to be an operating management company. And that means we will opportunistically look to sell the real estate of the owned assets of MGM Resorts. We're very proud of MGM Growth Properties. We expect to see healthy growth out of that enterprise and we're going to help through the ROFO assets and most likely from future transactions with MGP.","We want at MGM Resorts to reduce our ownership of MGP and we want to be under 50% of an economic interest of MGP within the next three years. We are going to successfully conclude all of our capital projects that we have been working on so hard and that have worked so well like T-Mobile and National Harbor. The ones that have yet to be finished will be finished this year.","We are going to achieve and then maintain a net leverage target of between three to four times, and that is through cash flow growth. And we're setting a goal today: we expect to generate $3.50 of consolidated free cash flow per share in 2020, which means we're affirming our 2020 guidance of cash flow we gave you on Investor Day.","We're going to use that free cash flow to the benefit of the shareholders. We repurchased $595 million during the second quarter and we have $1.7 billion remaining under the current authorization. We have a target to get under 500 million diluted shares by 2020.","And we are going to opportunistically access new markets for sports and interactive by leveraging our brands and our relationships and our partnerships and our expertise. We are not pursuing any regional gaming acquisitions in order to do it. We'll look for market access deals if we want to be there. And, in fact, the only development opportunity we remain laser-focused on is Japan. And I believe like in the arena of sports, we've made great progress since we talked to you last quarter.","And so, with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator so we can get to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question is from Harry Curtis of Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to start in Las Vegas. And Jim, as you sit in Vegas now and look at the balance of this year and the softness in group demand, if you could give us your perspective of what's behind that. Do you think that that Vegas has become somewhat less competitive given the greater attention being given to a group meeting by other cities? What can you and Caesars collectively do on bringing in more entertainment consistently so that we don't have these air pockets?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Sure, Harry. You're about the only one that's as old as I am, so you know that the third quarter is always volatile in Las Vegas. It hasn't been over the last couple of years. The all-time record citywide in conventions was 2016. The second record was last year. The third record, since I can remember, will be this year. This year, it's not a bad convention quarter. It's just up against these two incredible comps in the last couple of years. But in the context of the last several years, it's pretty decent.","The challenge has been that we did not get, as we hoped, an acceleration of small group business to fill in the holes that we fully understood were there for the third quarter. And because of that, the whole market started scrambling around to mix their rooms differently. Now, the higher-end properties have little trouble in doing that \u2013 Bellagio, Aria, our luxury properties. But when people are shifting around their decisions on stay, it does impact the mid-market properties, and it did in the third quarter. We don't see that happening in the fourth quarter because of the base of business that we expect to see. But given the fact that this was unusually slow over the last couple months, we've taken a very conservative approach to the balance of the year.","We think there's no reason to do anything otherwise. And so what I would say, and then I'll turn it over to Corey, is we saw a deterioration in some of the \u2013 in the year for the year. We moved business around where it made sense. The marketplace has been in that place. And now, we're starting to see a little bit of strength.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And, Harry, on the overall shape of the convention market, we've come off two record third quarters and even this quarter's mix that we're expecting, four years ago, we would have taken that mix any day of the year. We understand where a lot of those conventions went. And some of them are rotational, especially the citywides. We also had a few big rotational ones. But as we look especially in 2019 and 2020, what's on the books now, we don't see this softness in the convention market coming to Las Vegas. Is there more competition out there with the other cities? Absolutely, but we're geared up for it. And I think that Las Vegas, us, Caesars and even Wynn could create an experience that no other city can and can house conventions that no other city can because of our scale.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","I guess, my question, though, is with these air pockets, is there any way to \u2013 for the city and the two leaders in the city to become more proactive so that you have a more consistent base and don't have to rely on the OTA channels that really are killing pricing at least in the near term?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","I think it's something we have to work on and think about. Usually, the event calendar has a tiny bit to do with that. We had a little bit unfavorable third quarter, but in general it's just creating \u2013 we, here at MGM, we create our own events for our customers and components like that. But traditionally, even \u2013 I've been around 23 years, 24 years and summers have always been a challenge. This one is probably a little bit more challenging than others, but it's always been reliant on the transient leisure market. And we will constantly look at ways to get less reliant on that. But, in general, we're definitely going to strategize on how to try to address that.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","And I would just say, again, this is a third quarter phenomenon. It has been a third quarter phenomena. And the way we're going to address and we have been addressing it is to continue to bring content to Las Vegas. We brought the Las Vegas Aces, the game last night. We are sponsoring the Summer League, which was last month. That is going to be much bigger as an event next year than it even was this year. We're going to bring more content to T-Mobile. The Raiders are going to finish the stadium in 2020. There's an awful lot going on and there is no cause to change the strategy when it has been working. What we need to do is when we have these pockets, do the best we can without degrading the customer experience because if we do that, then people won't come back.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Very good. I just wanted to ask a quick question to Grant then related to the ramping up of junkets on Cotai. Can you give us some outlook on or expectations on how that ramp should look?","Grant R. Bowie - MGM China Holdings Limited","So, as we stand right now, it's on the agreements with the operators that will be opening. And it looks like we're going to be opening them in two tranches to try and balance \u2013 just to balance it up, starting as we currently sit in early September to give them a few operating \u2013 an operating period prior to October. So, as we speak here, we're probably only four weeks away from seeing those operators open up and they're the bigger operators. So, everything is going positively for us at the moment.","Harry C. Curtis - Instinet LLC","Okay. That's it for me. Thanks, everyone.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you, Harry.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Just, Jim, on the comments about discrete pockets of rate pressure in the 3Q in Las Vegas and you kind of talked about what that means exactly. But can you talk about it, is it persistent to what you're planning or anticipating seeing in both August and September? I'm presuming, certainly, July, do you have a sense of? And then how broad is it? Is it at the higher-end properties versus the lower-end properties, how broad-based? And then when did these discrete pockets of rate pressure, when did you first see that emerge? And then like why would you buy that $600 million worth of stock in front of an outlook that perhaps would give you a better opportunity to buy stock?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","For God's sake, you guys get so worked up about a few weeks. It's just unreal. Let's start with the quarter again. In May, we talked about what we saw happening. We wanted to fill some of those holes with smaller group business. We thought we would. We did not. We bought back stock and we will continue to buy back stock because we think our stock is ridiculously undervalued. And it is a good allocation of our free cash flow.","Do we think that there's anything going on in Las Vegas structurally that would cause us concern? The answer is no, because we see what's going to happen in the fourth quarter, which starts in about a month. So I appreciate the concern, I guess, around a couple month period of time. If I share that concern, I would tell you, but we have the benefit of having the data in front of us knowing that we're going to be stronger in the fourth quarter and going into 2019. So what we did know, what we do know is there was pressure around the city everywhere, not just to companies everywhere. And we see that pressure abating going into September and October.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And what I would say, Joe, is the biggest pressure, really, is on really that short-term booking window. So, the other channels that we're seeing are booking the way we like to see them book, actually they're pretty healthy, are our FIT channels and our casino channels. It's that real short-term booking window that has been very challenging. To answer the question, the Bellagios of the world, they're seeing less of an impact. People are trading up and we've seen that before in the past also. So, probably the biggest impact when you get into these pricing pressures are the core properties and probably the lower end of the core properties like the Excaliburs and the Circuses.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, guys. It's hard not to just sort of stay with this topic. I don't know how to position it to help everyone, but here's the way I look at it, right? When we look at the guidance and the pricing environment for Q3, like, this is the worst RevPAR number on a growth rate basis that you guys are going to have imprinted since 2009. It's the worst margin number you guys have imprinted since 2009. And that includes quarterly seasonality and convention shifts and CON\/AGG moving in and out.","So, I guess, the question we look at is, is there something bigger in the competitive landscape now maybe with Caesars coming out of bankruptcy, with more competition there, or something else that may have been exacerbating the issues that we're seeing in this period? And how can people gain confidence that it's not given kind of the very short-term visibility that we really do seem to have in the business?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Well, we're going to look at your margin assumption which \u2013 but on RevPAR, yes, it's the lowest year-over-year against the comps that we're talking about. Our margins have gone up dramatically over the last several years. So it can't possibly be...","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The year-over-year performance, Jim. Just down 450 basis points would be \u2013 again, minor tweaks aside \u2013 would be the lowest number we've seen since 2Q 2009.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Okay. But the margin itself is, what, much higher.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Of course.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Right. So, I mean, we're running the company on margin and on profit. So what we've seen is that short-term pressure we talked about. What we are seeing in the fourth quarter is not that. So, yes, against the comps that we had last year because RevPAR is almost all profit, when the RevPAR declines, your margins are going to go down, unless you want to dramatically reduce your cost structure to a point where it's going to affect service and we did not do that.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Understood. And just to completely shift gears, I mean, you gave a lot of strategic updates that were very important, Jim, in your prepared remarks, one of those being on reducing the ownership in MGP to under 50% within three years. Could you just talk, I mean, obviously, at a high level that can involve probably M&A that's hard for you to talk about, but could you just give us a sense of what kind of things would be along the path to being able to make that reduction and would you consider potentially distributing or selling additional shares in MGP?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","We consider everything. We believe we've said, but we now have put a perimeter around it that we should own less of MGP. We think MGP is going to grow. We know it's the premier triple-net in the space. We know we have the best management team. We know they have the best prospects for acquisitions with third-party operators and they're working on several of them. So, that will happen.","Secondly, we would be more than willing, at the right price, to reduce our equity ownership in MGP through the sale of OP units. And thirdly, MGP has the opportunity to transact with MGM in ways that would probably further, if done properly, reduce our equity ownership in MGP. So I think everything's on the table. But the goal is to reduce our equity ownership because we believe that, number one, there's great value, very valued arbitrage there; and number two, we think MGP would benefit from an expanded shareholding base.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, there. So, Jim, on your guidance, your RevPAR guidance for the full year down low-single-digits kind of implies a wide range for the fourth quarter. You do sound more optimistic for the fourth quarter. So I was just wondering, fourth quarter RevPAR given the guidance, it could be negative, it could be positive. Will it be positive?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","It'll be positive.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just getting to guidance, I think what a lot of people are so frustrated by is \u2013 and this is what I'm wondering, is how you \u2013 and you explained very clearly. You gave a guidance in April, what happened in May, what happened since then. But, I think, what's frustrating is how could you previously base second half guidance based on convention business or group business you were trying to get, but didn't have yet knowing that summer would be a challenge. So, maybe you can address the thought process there.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I'll answer, Felicia. I mean, the way we always forecast is we work with our sales team and we plan on not only what's on the books, but what we think we can because we want to make sure we're filling the rooms the right way. It just didn't come up to fruition this year. And so what you're seeing in our latest guidance is we have been probably more on the conservative side and pulled out most of that just because it didn't come to fruition this year.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. And I think that that's helpful and appreciate the conservatism, and hopefully, that practice continues because it just seems to give \u2013 to not kind of put in that kind of probability of uncertainty into your guidance I think gets you into these sorts of situations.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","It will and we are as frustrated as you because we were getting very weary of talking about RevPAR, which is not the metric we measure ourselves on here. I know it's what everyone wants to talk about, but we measure ourselves on cash flow and profitability. And yes, we're down in those metrics because of the factors we talked about. But we hear the message loud and clear from the Street. We're getting a little weary of talking about specific RevPAR guidance, but we're going to use tremendous conservatism in the future.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, Corey, are there \u2013 I mean, I know \u2013 I understand adding amenities, attractions, different things to bring people in during the quieter times of the year is helpful and hopefully in the future will be very additive. But I'm also wondering if there's any kind of systems or improvement internally you can employ to help the company be less reactive to the ebbs and flows of demand in the slower periods?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Well, the way we forecast our labor and everything is very much tied to our forecast, our seven-day forecast, so we're able to adjust our labor and expenses for that. But as long as I've been here and especially before the convention business was here in the summer, these ebbs and flows, especially for that three-month period, when it's 120 degrees outside, it's a challenge that we just get \u2013 fight our way through for that short-term period. We are looking at creatively how we may repackage certain things in the summer, looking at some of the competition for summer travel. As you look at, whether it's different industries or different cities, we constantly are looking at that and looking for better ways to maybe package how we do our business.","Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. When you guys think about the business more broadly, if I recall, convention mix is \u2013 for this year \u2013 is roughly close to flat, I believe, despite having some holes to fill. But what it seems is that that leisure, FIT, is just not firming up the way that it should. And when you think about bigger picture, U.S. macro, domestic lodging, performance, et cetera, what is it that you think is kind of keeping that business a little bit more subdued? As I would imagine that with the forward visibility that you do have and seeing some of the guidance revisions, a lot of this has to relate to that shorter booking window businesses, as Corey just mentioned. So, what is it that you think some of that domestic kind of core customer softness is stemming from?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","Hi, Carlo. Our FIT channels are actually hanging in pretty well. It's really the OTA channels that are probably a little more challenging. But I also think if you look at the macro components here, the city had its 6.6 million convention attendees last year, which was a record by over 300,000. If everyone's trends are similar to us, we'll be down a little bit in mix. So, you're probably looking at 400,000, 500,000 extra rooms that have to be sold in that channel. You add in the room supply, which has increased slightly, I think probably because of rooms being put on the market that were out of order, and you're probably looking about 600,000 extra rooms that are trying to get sold just for this year.","I think that's this year experience because what we're seeing for next year with what's on the books and what we're hearing from our competitors that are having similar trends of convention rooms on the books, there will be less reliance on that channel.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then, Jim, if I could just follow up? You mentioned earlier in response to a question about potentially purchasing or selling, sorry, OP units to kind of net down that MGP ownership. My recollection is that there are some tax consequences related to that. Has anything changed in terms of the ability to do that in a tax-efficient manner?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","We have a lot of options available to us. I brought it up as one of the many options that we have in order to reduce our ownership. Do you want to take them, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","I mean, Carlo, there's still a low basis in some of those units and a higher basis in others depending on the assets and when they were contributed into the venture. Obviously, things like National Harbor and Borgata will have a higher basis for us in terms of the OP units during those transactions versus the lower basis of some of the original Strip assets that went in upon formation. So there is some tax issues to kind of work through, but we learned a long ago from Mr. Kerkorian that we don't let kind of the tax tail wag the dog too much from that perspective. And if it makes sense to do in maximizing shareholder value, then we will look at it and take the tax into consideration.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. So, we're coming up to the anniversary of the terrible shooting on October 1. Is that having a disproportionate impact on that time of year just given it is the anniversary and maybe some experiences from last year? Thanks.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","You want to tackle that first, Corey, or do you want to...?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Hey, Thomas, it's Dan. Mandalay is still recovering as a property and is not fully back yet. We do see in kind of September, October, some of which is calendar-driven, but some of it is probably around the event timetable. We do see a little bit of softness around the event timetable in group, but we do have a pretty strong loyal base at Mandalay as well that is being very supportive and will continue to be supportive. So, we do see a little bit of weakness around that time period \u2013 later summer into the fall \u2013 but Mandalay as a property itself for 2019 is up quite nicely in terms of its pace. And that's good to see for the property longer term.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Dan.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. I would say the...","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","...the rest of the portfolio is pretty much back and Mandalay is probably about 80% back.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thank you. And then just on the Borgata, there's obviously new competition coming into the market. Can you just frame how you're thinking about \u2013 or there has been new competition? Can you frame how it's gone so far and how you're modeling the impact to that property? Thank you.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. There has been a little bit of impact. Borgata, obviously, has clearly been the market leader by a mile for a long time in that market, maybe a few miles. And we did expect, obviously, some increased competition with the two new properties and just the new capacity coming online. But it's early days right now, but I can tell you that we saw some initial impact in the first couple of weeks. Their business has recovered, but we do think just because of the capacity in the market that Borgata will be down a little bit, and we think that's probably in the kind of 10%, 15% range roughly.","But thus far, the property's been performing well. We're watching and looking at the covers, looking at a lot of the volume metrics. And after first couple of weeks, we're actually seeing those start to come back. So, looks like people are kind of testing out the new product, but realizing Borgata is still a great property and has all the amenities that it needs. So we do expect some impact just because of the capacity in the market, but Borgata is holding up well.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","The one thing we'll want to really watch \u2013 July, the first month, and actually I was over there, there's a lot of activity with a lot of concerts both at Hard Rock and Borgata had their 15-year anniversary. So, as a lot of that activity goes away, we'll have to see where the ship works out, but Borgata is very well-positioned to maintain its market share there.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Just to understand a little bit better and you talked about the Q3 phenomenon you called it as the fewer group events, but it looks like Q4 RevPAR guidance sort of implied is down at least sort of 500 basis points as well. So it seems like it's something beyond just this comping and the difficult seasonality of Q3. I mean, you mentioned that you took out the assumption about smaller group business coming in closer to the time. Is that responsible for like a 500 basis point swing in the RevPAR outlook in Q4?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","I don't know. I'm not sure where you get the 500 basis point, but we have been very conservative on our Q4 forecast to put in the trends that we're seeing now. Do we think those will continue? No, but that's how we forecasted Q4.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And our numbers don't show that level of decline. We're actually showing our RevPAR to be up in the fourth quarter.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","I meant the 500 basis point decline versus what your previous guidance had suggested. So, in other words, previous guidance would have implied something of maybe mid-single-digits and now sort of closer to flat again and you're saying still positive. So I just meant that delta, the change in your outlook being that couple hundred basis points. So, is that driven by that smaller group business that that level of change in the outlook?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","Our group business in the fourth quarter looks pretty good. But as Corey said, we're just being a little bit more conservative, given the current trends and the environment we're in right now. And as we get into and deeper into the fourth quarter, we see those trends changing. Our event calendar is stronger in the fourth quarter, particularly at our Arenas. So, hopefully, there's upside to the number. But right now, we just built in a little bit of conservatism from the standpoint of what that growth will look like.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And I'll just add to that, Robin. Over many years, we've been trying to be very granular on what our RevPAR is going to be every quarter. And when we meet it or exceed it, everyone says that's fine, big deal. And when we miss it, it's like a big disaster. And we're just not going to take that type of forecasting hit anymore. So, we are going to, including right now, be very conservative with a lot of cushion in our RevPAR guidance. And it is what it is. And we give more information than others. We're going to continue to do that. We're going to do that with the idea that we're going to be conservative.","We're not going to predict what we cannot predict. We're going to predict what we see happening in the marketplace right now. Do we expect that we'll be able to add business in the fourth quarter that would improve this guidance? Yes, we do. But we're guiding to this number because that's what we've seen coming off of this very tough pricing environment in the summer, and that's reflected in the fourth quarter. And that's what we're going with right now.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","And I appreciate the color. Maybe just one follow-up. You were talking about kind of the convention outlook in 2019 and 2020 that it's \u2013 you said it's not soft, but it's \u2013 I don't know if you used the word stronger, up or something. But it sounds like you're implying that 2019 and 2020 were better in terms of convention on the books. I guess, given the delta here that can be caused by maybe the small group meetings, like kind of on the margin, it seems like those small group in the year for the year make a pretty significant difference and, I guess, have much less visibility on a forward outlook. What does this sort of early view that you are implying about 2019 and 2020? Were you thinking that the convention mix will grow again in 2019? Because I would think at least for the large conventions that would be on the books already, you'd have some visibility on that?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","So, I'll take that. I think everyone's focused on the convention base and that's where the biggest miss was. The actual biggest adjustment to the RevPAR is in that land package. And 80% of it was in that land package. However, in looking at what's on the books, like I mentioned, we are up pretty good in 2019, almost 15%. But even more so, we don't talk a lot about this, but the convention calendar and how dates fall and how holidays fall are pretty favorable in 2019.","For example, Thanksgiving is at the end of November, on 28. That gives us one extra week to book. The holidays are a little bit more favorable. Some of them are on weekends, the Jewish holidays. So, that gives us a few more days to book. So, all of those things are positive. CES, which floated out a week last year, is going back right after New Year's. All of that will help as we try to drive our RevPAR.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And I would just add to that. So, one, convention business has been strong. Two, as we said, we tried to fill in the third quarter some small group business, which we weren't getting. So we went to the land package and the land package was where the pricing impacted our RevPAR. It was in the land package.","Looking into the fourth quarter, obviously, as we said, we see a better convention mix of business and the pace for our conventions of whether they're large or small are up in 2019 versus 2018. And so, that's what we were trying to suggest as what was happening in the third quarter when we veered out of the small group business when it wasn't coming in to the land business, that's where we had the rate compression. But going into the fourth quarter, we've lowered all that small business down because we don't know if we're going to get it. And we took a cut on 2019 and even with that, as Corey says, we expect to be up next year.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo - MGM Resorts International","And Robin, I just want to clarify something. Our in the year for the year is actually flat year-over-year. We were just forecasting it to be up, but it's flat. So, our mix overall will be down a little bit year-on-year. Obviously, CON\/AGG in last year kind of plays a big part in that. But just to be clear, our in the year for the year is pacing exactly as it was last year. We were just anticipating to kind of grow that part of the business a little bit. And that's the piece that we just fell a little short on.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John DeCree of Union Gaming. Please go ahead.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to kind of shift gears a little bit. Jim, you had made two pretty big announcements over the last week as it relates to sports and sports betting. And I think I have two questions. One, in markets where we're spending is not quite authorized yet or you don't have legislation. Is there an opportunity or initiative with your partner to get up and running on some type of interactive communication with your customer, whether it's kind of free play gaming or something of that nature that you could start to engage folks before even sports betting legislation is passed?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yes. That's a good question. So, first, as the states are going to roll out and you probably \u2013 everyone is probably doing their own modeling of this, but we would expect some very active legislative activity next year in high-population states like Massachusetts and New York and a couple others. And, of course, we'll be at the forefront of that with our Springfield property and when we close on Empire. From a standpoint of states that we cannot access because the legislative process will be slower, there's a social gaming opportunity that we're working on with GVC. So, we'll be able to \u2013 because they're a omni-channel provider, very different than simply a B2B supplier, we're going to be able to, we believe, talk to customers more robustly in more states than we otherwise could.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","If I could follow up on that, Jim, as it relates to an earlier question, I think early in the call, about kind of filling demand in Las Vegas on off-peak or shoulder season. With Yonkers coming to the portfolio, Springfield opening in a high-population dense state like Massachusetts and then the digital channel that's now on the horizon for you, if I think about the M life Loyalty Program and the expansion that you should see in that database over the next 12-plus months, how important is that to generating incremental demand in Las Vegas and how do you think about that opportunity going forward?","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","I think it will help. I think it's certainly incremental to what we otherwise have seen. But as I've said, I think that we are going to be \u2013 we are well-positioned for next year anyway. Bringing more content to the town will benefit our competitors and, of course, ourselves, but being able to bring more opportunities to town on the interactive side will, I think, on an outside basis help us. So, whether it's on e-sports or on interactive. We're working with the NBA leading into the Summer League and the activities we can generate throughout the year with that league working with other professional leagues, working in other areas of the interactive space.","The idea here is to: number one, maximize the profitability of our existing resorts, managing our expenses, and going for the higher margins that we put into our deck, the 32% EBITDA margin goal we have in our deck; number two, amplifying the existing buildings through the interactive and sports space; and three, becoming more asset-light as we can opportunistically sell some of our physical assets and continue to operate them. The interactive space is going to be very large in the United States and I don't think we all fully grasp what the potential can be over the next several years, not just in sports itself, but what that will do as a vehicle for the other digital channels.","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","And, John, also as I mentioned, our casino blocks are actually pretty healthy right now. Still below our competitors and I think that has to do a lot with Borgata going on to M life National Harbor. And it's not just going to be Yonkers, but Springfield is also going to open. So I think all of those are healthy. And as Jim mentioned on the interactive side, our deals with our partners are to expand our database and to convert the interactive customer into our brick-and-mortar buildings.","John DeCree - Union Gaming Research LLC","Thanks for the color, Corey. Thanks, Jim.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, thanks. Just to follow up on that line of questions and answers. As you dissect all of your customer data across the Strip and the regional markets, how is the softer leisure trend during the downtimes manifesting itself in locals markets? In other words, can you see if leisure consumers are just reallocating dollars to local markets? And then perhaps tie that into your response how that frames your strategy and perspective on sports and online betting longer term?","Corey I. Sanders - MGM Resorts International","So, in the regionals, the things that we look at in particular, slot volumes and everything just to see the health of the customer, Detroit had \u2013 just literally had their second best quarter \u2013 the best second quarter they had ever. Borgata slot revenue, which is one of the big drivers, was a record second quarter. National Harbor, obviously, has market share. And as we look at the markets and the market share, those are pretty healthy.","I think what we're seeing here in Vegas is consumers are looking for alternative places for entertainment. And so, it's not necessarily that there's a weaker consumer, but there's \u2013 look, there's alternative options for them. So we have to replace some of that option. Let's say, they went to Europe, which we understand there's been a lot of travel to Europe this year, that's where we're trying to adjust there. But, in general, the regionals are doing good. We believe \u2013 just to give you an idea \u2013 Borgata sports book is about 20% of our total company's volume in about a month. And so, we think that we're not seeing anything there that would indicate that it would impact sports.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","Yeah. And, in fact \u2013 I mean, adding to that, the regional properties are going to be big online gaming customer properties. And we're days away from New Jersey, so we'll be able to see that data pretty quickly in other states that we operate or through Boyd's market access, we will operate in very quickly.","I think also what's important \u2013 and that's why I know we're all frustrated on RevPAR \u2013 but we are a gaming hotel company, our market share in the second quarter on the Strip was up in every metric: our slot market share, table market share, Baccarat market share. And going into next year, we expect it to continue to grow, which is a big driver of our cash flows and profitability. And so, as we are going through this period where we had the knowns that we've discussed at length and then we had the strategy of trying to fill those holes, which we did not, could not and put it into the land-based model, which was at lower prices than we hoped, we're seeing that starting to improve in the fourth quarter; and we expect it to improve. But because of what we've seen the last couple of months, we just took a very conservative approach, which we will do forever more, because I don't like calls like this. And so, we are going to continue to be conservative on the RevPAR guidance because there's really no upside in us for doing anything other than that. It's not how we run our business. It's not what we see is going to happen in the fourth quarter in Las Vegas where we dominate. It's not what we see on the books for next year.","We had foreshadowed a tough third quarter three months ago. It came in worse than we thought, but at least we saw what was happening in the citywides. So, you can take that information into the fourth quarter where we see the citywides up and we see what we see in our books in the fourth quarter has been up. And since we have over 40,000 hotel rooms here, it's probably going to be the case for Las Vegas.","And going into 2019, we've seen no unusual cancellations at all. We're seeing bookings coming on. We see our pace being up in every channel. We're not going to forecast as much in the year for the year in our RevPAR forecasting in the future because there is no merit in that for us. We're going to continue to drive revenues everywhere, not just in the hotel business, which is but one of our many cash registers, but in all of our businesses \u2013 in our entertainment, our food and beverage, our gaming. We're going to drive more gaming revenue and we take more profit because of our leadership position in technology, interactive and digital. And we're almost done with CapEx. We're going to open up Springfield this month. We're opening up all the products that Grant talked about in Macau this year.","And as we go into 2019, the free cash flow that we're already generating is going to, we believe, dramatically accelerate to a point where we think we're going to be generating $3.50 of free cash flow in 2020. We're going to harvest that free cash flow to the benefit of the shareholders. And yes, we will continue to buy back stock. We think our stock is a tremendous opportunity for us and far better use of our capital than any acquisition on the global gaming horizon. We're going to continue to get to that leverage goal through driving our cash flow. And we're going to continue to work to build the foundation to win in Japan, the single greatest potential growth opportunity this industry has seen in a decade.","And so, I understand where we are. I'm particularly proud of the people that work here, the leadership of the properties, the men and women of MGM Resorts. We've dealt with a business situation that we're resolving in the marketplace. And we're seeing improvements going into the balance of this year. And we are confident of what's happening in 2019 and beyond. And we're putting our money where our mouth is in the form of returning the value to the shareholders, continuing to be the shareholder-oriented company that we are, continuing to use the levers that we have in front of us, to allow MGP to continue to grow, grow rapidly with a good balance sheet, and see MGM Resorts' ownership of that enterprise decline.","We continue to see what we can do in our existing portfolio and we continue the goal of becoming less capital-intensive and asset-light. And fortunately for MGM, because we have an outstanding balance sheet at 4.5 times leverage, with one of the simplest capital structures you can have, we have an awful lot, almost a vast amount of financial flexibility to not only deal with the choppiness of a month or two, but also to take advantage of market opportunities where we have that choppiness. And you're going to see that when we finish Park MGM. And you're going to see a very different resort by the time the Golden Knights hit the ice again this coming season. And that's going to drive a lot of incremental cash.","And to be clear, looking at our cash flows over the next couple of years in the ramp-up of it, all we need to do is do what we have done, finish projects and have them perform well, like we have done with MGM National Harbor, which obviously immediately became the market leader. All we have to do is continue to do that. Open up MGM Springfield and have it shine, and it will. It'll be very profitable and it's going to be there when sports betting is approved in the Commonwealth.","All we have to do is finish all the amenities that will drive cash flows in Cotai. And all we have to do is finish Monte Carlo's conversion to Park MGM, and then we sit back and reap the rewards of many years of development and a large capital spending that will set the foundation for much more rapid growth of cash flow in the future.","And finally, to be also clear, we have a very clear idea of our capital spending. It is going to remain in a very tight range for the next several years. And so, that free cash flow that will come from improving the operational efficiencies of the buildings that we have, battling out when we do have market softness like we had, and driving our additional free cash flow through these new properties, that's going to go toward the shareholder, as it has been and as it will in the future.","And finally and I think this is an important point, in our CapEx guidance that we have given and we'll continue to give, because we were ahead of the pack in terms of improving all of our buildings and we undoubtedly have the highest quality assets by a mile in every market in which we operate and all you need to do is go to any place in the United States to understand that, we're going to be able to without spending any more CapEx on those properties than what we normally do from a maintenance perspective, put money into exciting technology-related areas that we believe will drive incremental cash flow, greater productivity and result in less capital intensity in the complex in the future.","James Joseph Murren - MGM Resorts International","So I appreciate you spending the time with us today. We look forward to taking all your questions. Look forward to seeing you out here as the summer months thankfully are coming to an end. And as we get into the fall and football season, playMGM because that sports betting app will be the dominant leader. Thank you, all, very much. And we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

After the company's remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session. Please note this event is being recorded.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan D'Arrigo","Dan D'Arrigo","Well, thank you, operator and good morning and welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at www.mgmresorts.com and a replay of the call will be available on the company's Web site. We furnished our press release and Form 8-K this morning to the SEC as well.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws.

Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim Murren.","Jim Murren","Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to get through today and a lot of exciting news. Before I dive into the quarterly results I\u2019d want to first briefly address the big news of the morning. The Board of MGM and its executive team have come together to announce as a result of an exhaustive strategic review which we have outlined with you on many calls before. MGM Resorts intends to create a real estate investment trust or a REIT. This is not a spinoff but a newly formed REIT and it will be a publicly traded subsidiary of MGM Resorts. We will call this company MGM Growth Properties. We believe that this transaction is going to create significant long-term value to our shareholders and position MGM Resorts at leadership position as well as set the framework for MGM Growth Properties to grow rapidly in the future.","Before we get into that transaction I think I'll make sure we're going to have a lot of time in Q&A for, this is as you know an earnings call. So, we want to first start with our very fine results in the third quarter. As you can see we outperformed in every market in which we operate in the third quarter, our wholly owned domestic resorts we had the best EBITDA in the third quarter in seven years. And in fact it was the best EBITDA growth quarter since 2007. I think I just want to reflect that not for a second and thank the men and women of MGM that have produced such an astonishing growth in our cash flows in the third quarter.","Our margins of our wholly owned domestic properties increased over 400 basis points year-over-year, that was driven by both our Las Vegas and our regional resorts and in fact it was also the best margin growth quarter we had as a company since 2004. But I think that speaks to the quality and the diversity of our resort offerings which are obviously unrivalled in Las Vegas and we believe that competitive edge is only going to strengthen when we continue to focus on our profit growth and bring on new amenities for our guests, our customers. Notably the new 20,000 seat Arena that opens up next year at the Park along with the 5,000 seat sitter that Monte Carlo would get by the end of next year.","Over to CityCenter, their resort operations increased EBITDA at an astounding 20% year-over-year. That entire campus continues to thrive and grow literally across all its segments. And in Macau Grant and his team have worked really hard to maximize profits and that was evidence that you could see in the sequential margin improvement that Grant was able to achieve.","As you know back in August we announced our profit growth plan. If you recall we said that MGM would fully implement that plan by the end of 2016 and in doing so we would realize approximately $300 million of incremental EBITDA by the year 2017 for that year, ultimately driving our margins back to the 30% level. The key to the plan was to challenge and literally reinvigorate and encourage the entire company to make change, positive change to work smarter, be more innovative and permanently enhance our business, in other words we were looking for the quick fixes, we were looking for meaningful long term change.","And I tell you it wasn\u2019t initially an easy task and certainly not one that everyone thought we could accomplish it requires a structured approach and a very dedicated project management team and really a relentless focus on changed management, as well as communicating throughout the organization and being just absolutely dedicated on execution. And I say that because I'm incredibly impressed with the progress that we have made thus far in these few short months. I'm proud of the management team, I'm proud of the Board for giving us the tools to do this and I'm especially proud of the employees who are fully engaged and have been instrumental in the success of the plan so far. I'm really proud to say that we are implementing on all fronts both in terms of the revenue generating initiatives, as well as the cost savings ideas literally throughout the entire portfolio of resorts.","Some of the initiatives are in the early stages of being rolled out, some have already taken traction preliminary results are very-very promising and in some areas we're doing better than we -- even we initially anticipated. So we are well on track to actualize 10% or 15% of that targeted 300 million of incremental EBITDA by this year-end. And we are well on track of achieving the goal that we set out on our last earnings call of grabbing all that money for 2017. And more importantly we're laying the ground work for a stronger company that continues to drive value for everyone, our shareholders, our employees, guests and of course the communities in which we operate and you will get as promised the quarterly update on our PGP but the early report card is A plus for the management and employee team and we are on a roll here.","With that I'll turn it over to Dan D'Arrigo to dig into the financials a little.","Dan D'Arrigo","Well, thanks, Jim. First we will start in Las Vegas. We saw improvement across all three of our important segments casino, hotel and our food and beverage operations. On the casino front in Las Vegas we were up 5% led by increases in both on slot and table games win, our domestic table games business continued to benefit from an improving domestic rated play customer as we continue to drive visitation into our resorts with our new and exciting entertainment offerings and our in life program.","This was offset by lower China source based business on the high end side of the equation but our casino marketing team have done a terrific job in diversifying across various regions of the world including other Asian countries to mitigate some of the softness we've seen in China. Our hotel business was led by robust convention segment as well as healthy leisure bookings as the market continues to show signs of strength. Our wholly owned Las Vegas trip property has achieved 8% REVPAR growth in the third quarter exceeding our guidance of 6% these results were led by strong REVPAR gains that are non-luxury strip properties which were up some 14% while our luxury resorts were up 6% and looking ahead we are continuing to see strength in our forward convention booking trends both in terms of volume and pricing.","We're also seeing the booking window slightly expand as well. Based on these trends we expect to reach a new record in terms of our convention road mix of 18% for the year as you recall that's up from just over 17% last year and we anticipate our fourth quarter wholly owned strip REVPAR growth to be at least 8%. Our wholly owned strip EBITDA margins increased 465 basis points to about 25% in the quarter. This was as a result of not only the strong performance across the board at all of our domestic properties, but also we\u2019re beginning to see the early benefits of our profit growth plan. Our wholly owned non-luxury strip resorts continue to grow in the third quarter producing EBITDA growth of 41% with our luxury strip resorts growing by 24%.","Our regional properties continue to perform well and operate the best in class resorts and demonstrate their leadership in each of their respective markets. Their collective EBITDA grew by approximately 10% in the quarter and margins increased by 150 basis points collectively at those resorts. Jim mentioned CityCenter earlier it was led by strong performance in ARIA which reported growth of EBITDA of 23% to $59 million in the quarter, driven by 7% REVPAR growth and solid gaming volumes, as well as continued strength in their convention and catering business.","Vdara also achieved strong results with 30% and 7% EBITDA and REVPAR growth respectively in the quarter and Crystals continue to perform well and continues to attract luxury premium brands into its facility. Looking at the balance sheet at the end of the quarter cash and equivalents was approximately $1.8 billion of which approximately 808 million was at MGM China. We had 1.2 billion in available liquidity under our corporate revolver and approximately $700 million of excess cash on hand at the parent company, after giving effect to the pay down of 875 million of senior notes during the quarter.","CityCenter excess cash on hand at the end of the quarter was approximately 262 million and total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately 1.5 billion. To help with your modeling in terms of CapEx in the quarter, we invested approximately 252 million in capital related expenditures. Here domestically, we expect 109 million in our existing properties, 120 million on National Harbor and 23 million for MGM Springfield in the quarter. In addition, we completed our required equity contributions as part of our Arena joint venture of 60 million in the quarter and are now into the loan at the Arena for the rest of the funding to complete that project in April of next year.","During the third quarter, MGM China spent approximately 155 million of which 144 million was related to the development of MGM Cotai. In the quarter, our corporate expense was higher than both our guidance and normal. As we had some expenses related to implementation of our profit growth plan as well as the expenses related to our strategic review process. We anticipate that we\u2019ll continue to have both of those costs in the fourth quarter and our guidance for corporate expense in Q4 is going to be similar to what we experienced in the third quarter.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Grant for his Macau update.","Grant Bowie","Well thanks, Dan and very much appreciated for this early call time for those of us in Asia. The MGM China like the other operated in the market continued to experience a challenging business environment in Macau. We\u2019re encouraged to see some recent stabilization in the mass market. However, we still believe the VIP suite statement is still not out just yet. For the third quarter, we recorded net revenues of 529 million and adjusted EBITDA of 137 million, a decrease of 4% sequentially before the license fees. It\u2019s worthy of noting that despite current market conditions, our EBITDA margin has improved sequentially in the past few quarters. And our property EBITDA margin before license fees was 26% for the quarter and this is a 49 basis point improvement over the second quarter.","We\u2019ve always and continue to maintain a disciplined approach to efficiency management and we continue to review our business prices and have been successful in eliminating cost to prevent deterioration in margin, without impacting on our customer service standards. Our VIP table game win was flat quarter-on-quarter, while VIP was favorable, and Nassau was at the low end of the range. In this changing market environment, we are adapting our business to drive revenue across our business segment with more of the focus on our non-gaming operations. Compared to a year ago, our hotel cash revenue was up 24% and our rental income from leasing was up 36%. This of course was on a lower base, but it reaffirms our commitment to diversifying our business. As we execute our plans in anticipation of our Cotai opening, we are also realizing a cost base which will be significantly leaner than if we were running these two properties as separate units.","At MGM Cotai, we\u2019ve achieved a milestone by topping off their hotel towers and we will be celebrating this event in the coming week. We've also completed the structural steel installation on our spectacle roof structure and are on target to be completely and closed by the end of December. And we remain on budget and on target for a fourth quarter 2016 opening. As we seek to support the Macau business community earlier this month India and China announced our plans to expand business for their local small and medium sized enterprises. These initiatives affect on further increasing our engagement with the local business community.","Additionally, six of our most promising Macau team members have traveled to Las Vegas where they will develop their management, gaming and hospitality skills as part of the MGM Resorts\u2019 highly acclaimed Management Associate Program. This is our second year that we have participated in this program. Our goal is to provide a local talent with the opportunity to be our future leaders, as we look to support Macau development as an international tourism destination.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn back to Jim. Thank you.","Jim Murren","Well, thank you, Grant. And thank you for your great work over there. I look forward to seeing you next week. Reflecting on the quarter, the third quarter, I think the management team would say here that it validates our positioning in hospitality and in entertainment, not only in Las Vegas, but around the world. We are clearly outperforming our peers in our key markets, our market share is growing we\u2019ve been building upon our strengths with the types of products we have initiated in Las Vegas, but also our growth projects for example in National Harbor and in Springfield Mass and of course in Cotai.","The profit growth plan is already very improved and it\u2019s accelerating and we believe it will lead to an acceleration of the annual earnings growth of the company that we call MGM Resorts. Though we tell that we are in a perfect position, a perfect time to announce such a type of transition that we announced this morning, this announcement is the culmination of a tremendous amount of effort and literally many hours of meticulous brainstorming, not only by our Board and management teams but by a legion of very expert advisors in tax, legal, corporate financial and it was I have to say the most exhilarating effort that I have been through in my 20 odd years doing this.","We look at every single iteration and idea. We chase down every thought that might lead to an increase in shareholder value. We recognize that the company was blessed with significant value, real estate value. We also understood that we did want to jeopardize near-term value for the sake of a one-time gain. I know most of you have read the details in the release, but in short let me lay out this project for you. MGM Resorts will create a REIT called MGM Growth Properties. We hope this REIT will go public in the first quarter right around the corner here. MGM Resorts will retain a substantial majority interest in the REIT. We will contribute 10 of our premier assets and approximately $4 billion of debt will transfer over to MGP.","For a year now we\u2019ve explored countless structures and really even more iterations and we determined after that analysis that this transaction stalls some great opportunities for us. That will highlight the significant inherent value of our portfolio of destination resorts and it also creates a very healthy platform for future growth both at MGM Resorts and at MGM Growth Properties. And really it\u2019s also our overall goal of maximizing long-term value for all of our stakeholders.","We believe we found the answer and frankly it\u2019s more exciting than we had imagined when we began this journey last year. So MGM will contribute some of the most widely known iconic resorts in the world. Specifically, Mandalay Bay, the Mirage, New York New York, Luxor, Monte Carlo, Excalibur, as well as the park that we\u2019re building right now which will open in April all those properties, Las Vegas properties will be contributed into MGT Growth Prosperities. In addition, we will contribute our existing regional resorts, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, and Gold Strike Tunica.","MGM Resorts will lease and continue to operate the contributed properties under a long-term triple net lease REIT. We will also retain 100% ownership of Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Circus Circus Las Vegas, our significant undeveloped land holdings and the equity interests in CityCenter, MGM China, Borgata, amongst a few others. With the cash flows generated by the businesses remaining within MGM Resorts, MGM Resorts will maintain a very strong asset base to allow it to fund capital expenditures at these properties as well as our new properties in the pipeline.","So with that as a structure, I want to take a few moments to talk through the why we went down this past and how we got here. First, I think it\u2019s obvious to everyone on the call that we have long identified and understood that our assets were significantly undervalued in the marketplace. And for years really we were searching for ways to create really greater connectivity between the assets that we own and the values that are presently ascribed to them. Our main objective here was clear, we wanted to thoughtfully address the valuation disparity in our portfolio of assets and businesses in such a way that MGM Resorts was. Number one creating long-term sustainable valued for our shareholders. Number two ensuring that we were deleveraging the balance sheet as well as minimizing dilution and transaction cost in another words not the strange shareholder value for the stake of a transaction. And number three, enhancing our growth strategy both in terms of operations and in marketing and preserving the overall alignment of interest between what will now be two different companies.","And we think that this transaction meets all the criteria I just mentioned and is the best for the following reasons. One, our teams have worked throughout seven months incredibly hard to strike the right balance and alignment of interest between MGM Resorts on one hand and MGM Growth Properties, so that both companies will be strong thriving and have a sustainable future. The structure we\u2019ve designed to minimize friction cost and in fact, we are highly excited about how minimal they are relative to all the alternative transactions that we had initially explored. The value destructing ideas of spin-off in massive asset sales that would have resulted in large debt breakage cost or purging of earnings and profits, none of that happens here because we found a way to create a new company, a new REIT, where we will have a substantial equity interest, so that we can benefit from the growth of that REIT and minimal, minimal cost, that structure appealed to our Board given also the experience expedient timetable, there is no waiting for an IRS ruling, there is no hoping that a deal can close in a year or two. We expect that this transaction will close within the next few months. And in fact we will have an opportunity to offer shares in this exciting new REIT in the first quarter of next year.","Secondly, we wanted to create a large publically traded triple-net lease REIT that has a tremendous portfolio of assets obviously the highest quality assets of any triple-net lease REIT certainly in the gaming industry. We wanted to create a vehicle in a financing platform by which we could lower our cost of capital and raise funds for future growth opportunities for this REIT. MGM Resorts will maintain a substantial economic interest in MGP so we\u2019re in it together, we want to see MGP grow, grow rapidly and MGM Resorts expects to receive dividends that any REIT holder would expect and benefit from the stable and growing cash flows of MGM Growth Properties.","MGM Growth Properties also will have a right of first offer of our development properties in Maryland and in Massachusetts, thereby presenting a growth path and a trajectory that is superior to any in the space, large projects that can be acquired overtime to add to the portfolio of already high quality, high cash flowing assets.","And in MGM Resorts it certainly back tracks, our REIT, our dedication to deleveraging our company. Because as part of this transaction MGM Resorts will transfer approximately $4 billion of debt over to MGP and that company MGP will subsequently refinance that indebtedness through its own debt and equity as a result of an IPO we expect in the first quarter. So as a result of that MGM Resorts will have the ability to accelerate its path of deleveraging and further improve the financial strength and flexibility that MGM Resorts has. So in short, we believe we found a mechanism to create two strong, rapidly growing healthy companies with different investment profiles and will attract different investors, yield investors, in the case of MGM Growth Properties, growth investors in the case of MGM Resorts and importantly and this is very important, the daily operations will continue as usual we do not expect any impact on our employees all of which will be MGM Resorts employees as they are today our guests and our business partners.","When I look back on this company, MGM over the past 18 years, I believe we\u2019ve grown to be one of the best managed and most innovative companies in our industry and one that is not afraid to make change. This company has and always will be an architect for thoughtful and transformative pursues that creates long term value. We believe this is a dawn of a new threshold for this company, and we will lead this industry into an exciting decade to come.","And with that operator I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you so we can get into Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Joseph Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joseph Greff","With regard to MGP, can you give us a little bit more detail on the rental lease terms, dividend policy the target leverage I know there is one other gaming REIT out there that we all kind of look at as one version of it, but if you can provide those details? And then my second question, obviously the 3Q much better than all of us were expecting. On the EBITDA line, how much of it is just a better domestic market? How much of it does relate to the profit growth plan? And then where do you think you are in terms of the annualized what you achieved in the 3Q, where are you with respect to the benefits of the profit growth plan? And that is all for me. Thank you.","Jim Murren","Maybe I\u2019ll start Dan and then turn it over to you. So you can correct me. First we have studies the GLPI lease, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we used that as an initial benchmark of looking at the current state that\u2019s out there we\u2019ve also looked at leases that have been pro-offered by other companies that have explored this concept. And the overarching objectives were to create a strong REIT and have good coverage in something that is pretty much market I think is safe to say again.","Joseph Greff","Yes that is good.","Jim Murren","So even though, we\u2019re not trying to reinvent the wheel in terms of lease structures here. I think we would say that there are certain iterations to ours, which will be forthcoming that make it a little bit contemporary but beyond that it\u2019s pretty much as expected. I\u2019d have to say about the quality of the assets and the growth trajectory of the assets being contributed. Mandalay Bay as an example just finished its convention expansion you know that\u2019s the fifth largest convention center in United States. We have invested significant amount of capital in that property with the Delano upgrading restaurants, the convention expansion. And I would say that same would be said for the amount of money we\u2019re currently investing around the Arena with significant dollars going into Monte Carlo with the theater, the upgrading of New York New York, the Park. And I would say that because I believe there is going to be significant opportunities for all the contributed assets to grow. And in fact they are growing right now.","I looked at the third quarter and if you were to look at the contributed properties in the third quarter their cash flow and Kathy, where I think we\u2019re up 33%.","Unidentified Company Representative","Right.","Jim Murren","So we are really limited as to what we can talk about specifically on MGM Growth Properties, but since their ours, these properties at MGM Resorts. I could tell you they had a great quarter and most of that was due to strong operating results in terms of REVPAR, food and beverage and a great convention quarter and a great outcome for this year. The profit growth plan was minimal relative to the overall growth results that we had in the quarter. And as I say by the time we get to the end of the year Chris will might be 10%, 15% into the number, but certainly the third quarter was not that as big an impact it\u2019s going to accelerate rapidly as we progress over the next five quarters.","Joseph Greff","And can I just follow-up with regard to the REIT, and the leverage or the way about the leverage? So the REIT will initially have $4 billion of debt. If I try to think about that leverage, that leverage will then be variable relative to the amount of equity to kind of have a market based leverage ratio, compared to other triple-net leases. Is that how one should think about it?","Jim Murren","Yes, Jeff. That is pretty fair. It will be I am afraid middle down the fairway in terms of its leverage, compared to its peers in the market.","Operator","Our next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","Yes so, Jim, a large part of the value of this transaction in our view, how we are looking at it is the valuation multiple overcharge you\u2019re going to get by having the majority of your assets in the triple-net leased REIT? And then, for having MGM own a significant majority of that. So we\u2019re trying to work that through now, everybody is. And with the REIT not being a tax free with the REIT being a taxable entity, it\u2019s probably going to trade a bit differently than the triple-net leased REIT peers out there. So as you thought about the value that would be created by this transaction, just wondering how you were thinking about the valuation relative to the peers in light of the tax status of the entity?","Jim Murren","Well the REIT will be tax free.","Felicia Hendrix","Okay, so it\u2019s going to be a true REIT. Okay, because a lot of people had that question and that would lead to this distribution so that\u2019s great. And then when you say the significant majority. Is there a way that you can help us through that? I mean is it more than 60%, less than 70%? I mean is there way you can\u2026","Jim Murren","Yes, yes, yes we\u2019ve asking here, because we\u2019re trying to figure out what we are allowed to tell you. So we got a legion of lawyers that the way I well, I will just tell you how that is done. So one is, it is important, and we are establishing a REIT tax free and that will be we hope launched in the first quarter, when we do an IPO when we will offer shares to the public. Initially MGM resorts will probably own around 70% odd of MGM Growth Properties with the balance being held in terms of the economic interest. We\u2019ll own about 70% plus or minus of the economic interest of MGM Growth Properties with the balance being held by the public, reason why we were working through this is that we clearly believe there is substantial upside of in ownership of those debt equity. And we wanted to create a company that had enough liquidity in the marketplace, a big enough REIT that would trade really well from a liquidity perspective and we wanted to have an alignment of interest between this new REIT, which we will be managing and MGM Resorts. It also sets up a tremendous amount of optionality going forward. The new REIT of course will have its own Board of Directors.","It will be managed independently and it will decide its own growth path. And that could mean anything in terms of MGM Growth Properties and we want to make sure it\u2019s intentional that it has maximum flexibility today to pursue anything it would want to do in the future. So what we believe, I mean we will see how you all figure this out as you are going to value MGM Growth Properties as a REIT with an emphasis on the fact that it\u2019s got the quality of the assets than it has and a thoroughly unique growth path because of the wealth where it has with National Harbor and Springfield and you will view MGM Resorts, how you will view it, but certainly as a company with a stronger balance sheet less leverage pro forma than it does today with the growth plans that its already articulated in terms of the developing these assets and participating in what is really a very robust recovery in Las Vegas.","Felicia Hendrix","That's helpful and actually just to your last point estimate last final question. Is with the -- how are you thinking about now the optimal leverage levels at MGM?","Jim Murren","Well I promised, our Board we\u2019d get down under five times leverage, I think I have mentioned that on a few conference calls I have gotten some sideways looks for somebody here, but you could see we had a few ideas in mind, so that still is the goal it is certainly very achievable, given this transaction what it means for MGM Resorts and frankly many other options we have on the table in terms of dividends distributions and in any of our other joint venture enterprises.","Operator","Our next question is from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","A couple questions, Jim, you touched on the management of the thesis. Maybe you could begin with your thoughts on how that's going to evolve?","Jim Murren","Well, sure one is that MGM Resorts\u2019 Board, obviously I Chair. And Roland Hernandez is our Lead Director. MGM Resorts will populate the new co, MGM Growth Properties with its own Board of Directors, I likely we will also be the chairman of that company. But MGM Growth Properties will have its own independent set of directors, some of which we know today and many others we\u2019re going to know, we\u2019ve already engaged a hiring regarded search firm to reach out and find experts in REITs both triple-net lease REITs and otherwise. MGM Resorts will manage the properties under that triple-net lease REIT and so therefore the management team of MGM Resorts stays the same. But there will be management that will be brought on to MGM Growth Properties to manage its own affairs, so there will be a new CEO a CFO and probably one or two other Executives that work solely at the pleasure of the Board of MGM Growth Properties, because we want to set that company up to independently forge its own path, that grows rapidly as it sees fit, so initially, because MGM Resorts is managing these assets that we currently own and MGM Resorts will own the majority of the economic interests in MGM Growth Properties, you will see some commonality of Board Members, but you will also see new faces particularly on MGM Growth Properties but likely also on MGM Resorts as well as we our self want to continue to be more educated in real estate.","Harry Curtis","Follow-up question is just the growth path for each of the separated companies, if you could touch on that? And then the last question is, can you talk about your expectations in Vegas for 2016? Thanks.","Jim Murren","Well I will talk about the growth path of MGM Resorts, wherein MGM Growth Properties is in a quiet period. And I have got three lawyers who are shooting daggers at me right now, talking about that. So I\u2019ll try to talk around that and talk about MGM Resorts. So Las Vegas obviously surprised folks in terms of the strength of the business. And I am very happy to say that that is continuing to the current quarter. The real driver of this accelerated growth for us is the convention business. Dan alluded to the fact that convention mix is improving. It is remarkable to us that a convention expansion only just completed at Mandalay Bay is already fully occupied for next year.","We\u2019re taking an inventory of all of our convention and conference sates and we have a very talented team, led by Mike Dominguez that is out in the marketplace moving business around. Basically trying to find greater utility and efficiency, because we have so much demand and as much spaces we have, we don\u2019t have enough space. That\u2019s why we talk about REVPAR growth of 8% in the fourth quarter, while we\u2019re really excited about Las Vegas in general in 2016. On the convention side should be our best year ever.","Added to that, I don\u2019t want to minimize the impact of the Arena that opens up in April. Imagine a 20,000 seat Arena opened we\u2019ve already programmed a couple of dozen dates into that Arena of just A acts. That will accrue to the benefit of all of our properties, but particularly the ones that are nearby, Monte Carlo and New York New York. So if I would ask our properties where should we see the biggest delta of growth in our portfolio it would be in the convention-oriented properties as well as the ones that are hovering around this Arena and theater.","On top of that, I would expect the profit growth plan to lead to an acceleration of our earnings. Because the big initiatives are being deployed now, much of that is in Las Vegas and all of that will be completed by the end of next year. So you\u2019ll see a liftoff, I think of profitability as the result of the macros and as a result of the internal plans that we have underway. From a standpoint of our regionals they are excellently managed, I think they\u2019re pretty much on track to do the kind of business they have been doing. They\u2019re profit and market leaders. And they\u2019re going to outperform the market to market themselves a relatively stable I would say.","And so that leaves for MGM Resorts its growth initiatives which are the interactive business, which we don\u2019t talk about much. But it\u2019s growing for us in terms of cash flows and in terms of customer acquisitions it leads to National Harbor, which we believe will be the most profitable resort in outside of Las Vegas in North America, when it\u2019s opened next year and it opens in the fourth quarter. And it leads up to Springfield, Mass which opens up in 2018. So MGM Resorts has many tools at its disposal right now to accelerate its earnings growth and participate in a rapid deleveraging story, because of the dividends we expect to get in the future at MGM China as well as at CityCenter, CityCenter itself is accumulating cash as we speak and we will likely dividend out money to its owners by the end of the year.","As it relates to MGM Growth Properties, I am not allowed to give specific guidance on them as a entity. But considered where they are and the fact that our core properties much of which are in MGM Growth Properties construct. The core properties are outperforming the luxury properties. And we\u2019ll do best in a rising convention market and have been the beneficiary of the substantial amount of capital, which is why they are outperforming their peers. So the combination of solid regional cash flows and a Las Vegas presence, which skews to the benefit of our core properties would likely lead some to conclude that that portfolio could outgrow the MGM Resorts\u2019 existing portfolio, given the assets that are in MGM Resorts.","Operator","Our next question is from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli","Just from a very simplistic income statement perspective, could you guys kind of think or maybe talk through maybe how the MGM Resorts\u2019 income statement will change? Obviously, in the case of Penn you just add a line of rent et cetera. How are you thinking about that and obviously with the 70%, I assume the accounting treatment will be similar to that of MGM China? And then just as a follow-up, could you provide some color as it pertains to the lease payment? Whether that will be fixed variable, and how we should be thinking about that?","Dan D'Arrigo","Hi Carlo, it\u2019s Dan I\u2019ll take a shot of that the accounting is spot on, the accounting will be much like it is for MGM China, when you look at the MGM Resorts\u2019 financial segments on a go forward basis, so it will be a fully consolidated entity and then we will record whatever that minority equity interest is of the portion we don't own of the REIT company, so a lot of the REIT-type accounting so to speak will be eliminated in consolidation and will come through as a 100% on entity with the minority interest much like MGM China today. As far as the lease structure itself, it will be a triple-net lease as Jim mentioned earlier and not too dissimilar to what is out there in the market in terms of coverage from the lease perspective.","Carlo Santarelli","So if we thought about it that way, something around, there in the realm of a 1.8, 1.9 times coverage ratio?","Dan D'Arrigo","It\u2019s in that realm.","Operator","Our next question is from Shaun Kelly of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","So just a follow-up on a couple of the questions on the OpCo side, so, again I think we\u2019re starting to get a better picture of the structure. But maybe you could help us understand, do you anticipate post-IPO that the transaction is going to be sort of leverage neutral either for the -- well, it should be de-levering for the consolidated entity, but for the OpCo, specifically do you see that leverage-neutral to where MGM Resorts sits today?","Dan D'Arrigo","Yes, it would from an OpCo\u2019s standpoint it would continue to be deleveraging even in an OpCo perspective.","Shaun Kelley","Okay. So do you leverage your\u2026","Dan D'Arrigo","Yes so go ahead and then we will remember we\u2019re going to be doing an IPO so there will be new equity that will be raised in the first quarter.","Shaun Kelley","And will those proceeds -- so a portion of those proceeds may be shared with OpCo in addition to simply paying down some of the 4 billion of debt that goes to PropCo?","Dan D'Arrigo","No remember the assets in the $4 billion of debt go down into PropCo. So then PropCo will go out and raise its debt and equity capital markets transactions at the OpCo level. I mean I\u2019m sorry at the PropCo level.","Shaun Kelley","At the PropCo level, okay I follow and then second question is that just given sort of how GLPI has traded and been received by the rededicated community. It's a little hard obviously, with these types of processes. Do you have any feedback or have you kind of had any conversations at a high level with your general views on how you think such an IPO would be received by sort of a new investment audience?","Dan D'Arrigo","Yes, obviously their transaction was different as you well know Shaun, in that it was a spin, so the existing shareholders were given the new equity of this SpinCo and in this case GLPI. So obviously if the investors, were going to hold to it, it\u2019s hard to for new investors to come in and in this dynamic it's a different, where as we will be IPOing directly out to REIT investors, potential new REIT investors as well as existing gaming investors. So it is a little bit different in terms of the comparison between the two approaches and I think we\u2019ll have a real good audience, if you look at the asset quality and the type of REIT we will have on day one out to all those investor pools.","Jim Murren","Yes and may be Dan, I would just add, it\u2019s Jim that we thought about this, this is obviously going to be up to you all to decide how this is valued, but we were very thoughtful, we tried to be in terms of putting together a portfolio of assets and brands that are scalable. Mandalay Bay is a scalable enterprise, one of the premier convention center hotels in the United States. Mirage and Luxor and Excalibur, these are powerful brands, and so we believe there will be an emphasis placed on not only the quality of the portfolio. But in the construct of hospitality broadly and the convergence of gaming and non-gaming hotels and the ability for this company which is intentionally large and liquid to be able to grow not only by using its brands, but by land that it owns and by the financial structure that it could develop, we think that it\u2019s certainly highly unique and we\u2019ll set itself apart from the comp that you mentioned and really anyone else that is attacked this issue.","Shaun Kelley","And my last question would just be, I'm familiar with one other one of these sort of internal REIT structures and in that case, they have to maintain more than 50% ownership in the REIT to keep some of their tax features. I'm curious if the same is true with this structure. So would you have, to keep the tax benefits that you guys have structured here, do you have to always own more than 50%? Or is there an ownership threshold that you have to keep in the REIT overtime?","Jim Murren","No, Shaun, there is not a threshold that will just in the future up to the Board of the property company and the facts and circumstances at that time.","Operator","Our next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Congratulations for this announcement, I\u2019m sure took a lot of work, so two questions from me. First, Grant you have been quiet this whole obviously the Studio City just opened, any initial thoughts on that? And how the competitive environment is in general? And then my second question, I feel a bit greedy asking this question. You guys have talked about potentially selling Crystals in the past. Is that off the table now? Thank you.","Grant Bowie","You want me to go first Jim? And then I will turn back to Crystals?","Jim Murren","That sounds like\u2026","Grant Bowie","So, Studio City they did a good opening, it\u2019s obviously a pretty impressive property. I think anything new, any additions to the market is a good thing about creating opportunities. But I think they would acknowledge themselves, they still have some work to do as we all do in terms of performance, but I think they did a nice job. So I think it demonstrates that when existing operators opening to a market they are used to, they have a bit of talent pool. So some of the service issues that you would have normally have experienced in properties you didn\u2019t see on this occasion. I think they did a very nice job. I think it will certainly create noise all of us and we are all optimistic that that provides an inflection that we are all looking to get to drive traffic and build quality people who want to who come and spend. Because I think that is one of the important issues but as we diversify into a non-gaming area that we actually are attracting customers that actually want to buy the non-gaming services and I think that all of us who are coming on stream in the future and I know from Mass perspective we are very excited about the quality of the project we\u2019re going to deliver it is going to encourage people to actually spend money in actually the non-gaming services to supporter the investment that we\u2019re making in. I think that\u2019s probably enough. Jim, I will turn it back to you.","Jim Murren","Well, thank you Grant. And the answer is yes. We have had a significant amount of interest in Crystals as an asset. We have been fielding a variety of qualified imbalanced calls. We have evolved this to a point where we have expert advisory help sorting through principal investors that are interested in buying all or a part of Crystals. And that the Board of CityCenter has been evaluating what is thankfully being coming a rapidly appreciating and highly-coveted asset. And so I think we last checked in, I said that it was certainly on the table, we think it\u2019s worth over a billion dollars I am more confident of that than I\u2019ve been in the past given the amount of efforts that has already taken place here and absolutely at the right valuation Crystals is an asset that would be sold to the benefit of its owners Infinity World and MGM Resorts.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steven Kent","So what specifically does the Park encompass? I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to understand. And how much in earnings do you expect it\u2019ll make in the context of including it in the REIT? And then why is the Arena not included in the REIT? And then just one final thing, I\u2019m not sure if you could answer this yet. Do you need a private letter ruling? Or because it is a new company is that not necessary I\u2019m not that familiar with the legalities of this?","Jim Murren","Don\u2019t worry so I will pick a few and then turn it over to Dan or to Shawn. So none of our joint ventures are in the REIT, so the Arena is a 50-50 JV with Phil Anchutz\u2019s company and so it does not qualify for what we\u2019re trying to accomplish in terms of the REIT only wholly-owned properties are going into the newly formed REIT. And no, we do not require a private letter ruling. This is not a spin-off and so therefore we do not require that. In fact, we went down this path and zeroed in on this option long before the more recent guidance from the IRS. And I think that was in relations to Alibaba and Yahoo! I think Dan and maybe a few others. But we were down this path of contributing assets and forming a new REIT long before that iteration. You want to take the part two it is the\u2026?","Dan D'Arrigo","Yes. I mean I think when you look at the Park does have some EBITDA contributing factors to it and some restaurant and entertainment venues. But the real rationale is it is proximity to Monte Carlos, New York New York and how that real estate kind of fits in to the future on those two properties?","Jim Murren","Yes, we knew that as the connected tissue between two large scaled resorts and we believe that it will be a center of gravity for a lot of tourist traffic that will be going to those resorts and to the Arena itself and so we felt that it should be all part of the same asset package.","Steven Kent","But it will be relatively modest contributor of EBITDA then? Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Just trying to understand the structure a little bit better, because when you look at the EBITDA generated by the 10 properties with real estate you are contributing and what that would suggest they could pay in rent. It doesn't seem like enough to support the $4 billion in debt. So I wonder if you could just give a little more color around will that be -- how much would you hope to be paid down by funds raised during the IPO? Just to think about how these ratios can work?","Jim Murren","Well Robin we can\u2019t get into specifics around in general properties. But the combination of the debt going down from the parent to the property company and the property company then going out and raising IPO proceeds in conjunction with their capital raising efforts that combination will put the right amount of leverage on the property company kind of going forward?","Grant Bowie","Yes solving for that coverage ratio that you talked about earlier Dan.","Robin Farley","Is there a just as kind of debt to EBITDA ratio that you think of it being standard for REITs that we could keep in mind when we\u2019re looking at this?","Grant Bowie","Yes, I think there is enough market precedent out there when you look at kind of triple-net REITs and where they trade from an overall leverage standpoint that would be good proxies to use.","Robin Farley","Okay. And then I guess lastly will there be kind of rent bumps in the agreement that or will it just will be kind of a fairly fixed rate going forward?","Grant Bowie","That will be a fixed and variable rate, but there will be escalators as normally found in triple-net lease structures and as Jim said earlier, we are not looking to kind of reinvent the wheel with respect to the master lease here it will have very similar characteristics as what exists in the market and the modifications will if any will be more around just our assets and our buildings that kind of make them unique to the structure going forward.","Robin Farley","Okay. Thank you.","Jim Murren","And I think maybe I would add too Robin. I mean we worked a big part of this effort was to assure that MGM Growth Properties was on very firm footing right out of the box. Because we\u2019re going to own a substantial interest in this, we wanted to make sure that it is strong from a balance sheet perspective that it\u2019s transparent and easy to understand from an investors\u2019 perspective that it has precedent efforts that make it very easy to analyze from a lease perspective and that it has a growth plan that can be articulated. So when that company is out in the market raising money in its IPO, you will have all these information we\u2019re just a little bit handcuffed by the bankers and lawyers in terms of the quite period that we\u2019re in, but I think it\u2019s important for you at least to know the philosophy here, the philosophy is to create a strong, stable, vibrant REIT that will trade well, because of its liquidity and quality of assets, its management team, its sponsorship by MGM Resorts, the brands that it has and the growth prospects that it uniquely has because of the welfare that I talked about.","Robin Farley","And may be just one final clarification, it sounds like the idea is that MGM Growth Properties will be a single tenant. I mean in other words that, you're talking about the growth coming from Maryland to Massachusetts. So it\u2019s -- the idea is for it to remain kind of a single tenant REIT?","Jim Murren","No, not necessarily, I\u2019m sorry if I led you to that conclusion, it will go out and we\u2019ll seek out acquisitions in not only the gaming space, which is obviously its comfort zone, but it will have a mandate to look in hospitality broadly, clearly there will be at least clear in your view there will be a lot of assets that will trade in the gaming space either as individual properties or as portfolios of properties over the next few years. MGM Growth Properties intends to be in the dialogue in all those discussions and it should and it could do that and it may or may not reach out to MGM Resorts to manage those assets it could easily be a situation where MGM Growth Properties acquires assets that others would manage. So this is set up to be a strong company that will be able to opportunistically pickoff assets as they become available in the gaming and broadly in the hospitality space. And when appropriate, reach out to MGM Resorts for management. But I can\u2019t emphasize that enough, this company\u2019s setup designed given the scale of the company. The management team that will be in place, the balance sheet that we will ensure it has, it is designed to grow. Not only by virtue of its relationship with MGM Resorts, but by virtue of the fact that in and of itself, it will be one of the premier gaming owners in the world.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Jones of Union Gaming. Please go ahead.","Chris Jones","A couple of questions, first, as a relates to as the name would suggest, and I mean MGM Growth. Is it safe to assume that so in the early days really the growth is going to be focused on the redevelopment of some the assets that are going to the portfolio? I think about the Monte Carlo, some of you guys have talked about, as well some of those other assets? And then secondly, just going back to the operations for the Bellagio versus MGM Grand, I see the Bellagio really came alive this quarter. Should we expect to see that continued sort of performance out of the Bellagio? I know it\u2019s had a challenging couple quarters here as well? If you could just talk about that that would be great, thank you.","Jim Murren","Well maybe I\u2019ll take the first part turn over to any number the other folks here I have got Corey Sanders to my right and Bill Hornbuckle on my left and so yes, I think the word growth was intentional in a few respects. One is, we think it can grow beyond its current asset base. But within its asset base we see growth. There is no surprise to you that we are viewing Monte Carlo with a very optimistic lens, the fact that its 3,000 rooms, next to CityCenter embracing a $400 million Arena, $100 million Park right on the center strip. Means it clearly can be something more than it is today. And we believe that it will and it will be called something else and it will be positioned differently and it will grow its cash flows by virtue of putting in strategic capital into that property.","I would have to say that there are other great opportunities that we\u2019re looking at as well. Corey Sanders has got a team looking at Excalibur, and recognizing the fact that we have a very underperforming corner of Tropicana in the Las Vegas Boulevard. And why wouldn\u2019t we do what others have done so successfully and draw mid-scale retail into that corner and therefore drawing traffic into Excalibur. We know from our conventions dialogues, I\u2019ve had a meeting as recently as last week. Bill and Corey, with conventions people this week, that if we had more convention space for the association business and if we had more concrete space, which is relatively inexpensive to build. We could dramatically increase the cash flows of Luxor, as an example. And the list goes on and on. We don\u2019t view our portfolio of properties that we\u2019re contributing in as mature properties we view them as properties with stable and strong cash flows that were up 33% year-on-year in the current quarter, but that each and individual one have their own growth trajectory. And so what this allows us to do is over the next few months. Evaluate our portfolio in a very specific way looking at return on investment as the criteria and where we deploy capital in the highest ROI way. As it relates to Bellagio versus MGM do you want to take that?","Dan D'Arrigo","And maybe one thing just to point out as well, that capital decision and the capital requirements under the master lease would be borne by the operating company going forward. So MGM Growth Properties could be a source of capital to fund and maybe cheaper financing to the operating company. But those decisions will continue to be made by MGM Resorts and the capital would be borne by MGM Resorts under this new structure going forward.","Jim Murren","And Bellagio?","Dan D'Arrigo","And on Bellagio, they actually had their best third quarter since 2006. So that even goes vague during the peak. They had a tough few quarters on the REVPAR growth and we\u2019re starting to see the changes we made there and the strategic focus on the convention business there. And I would foresee them continuing to perform at the level that they performed in the third quarter.","Operator","Our last question today is from Joel Simkins of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Joel Simkins","A couple of quick questions, I guess first Jim, on Circus Circus. I wanted to understand the rationale of not including that in MGP? I guess would this imply that this is also on that sort of list of potential, major re-developments? And then the second question, I will ask you a non-REIT question while we have you. Love to get your take on DFS, and what this ultimately means in terms at least having more of a real conversation around sports betting?","Jim Murren","Yes. So Circus Circus is a really exciting and intriguing longer term, but intriguing opportunity we believe for MGM Resorts it sits on 100 acres, can you imagine that 100 acres and we\u2019ve got a young management team there that is just crushing it right now and you could see it in the results, they are enthused, they are having fun, they are innovating, they are a big part of our profit growth plan. Eric Fitzgerald, who runs that property has been a leader on some corporate initiatives and we feel like a smaller property in terms of cash flows, but its punching above its weight and it\u2019s got a lot of potential and yes, clearly there is an awful lot of opportunity that could go around there when we did the Rock in Rio music festival we saw a nice bump, as the future of Las Vegas, as you know, we are leader in that area of bringing music festivals, whether its EDC or live music and we will be doing more of that. So yes it is not a major contributor of cash flows to MGM Resorts, but it is a major contributor of ideas and innovation and it certainly is out there as it relates to growth potential. On daily fantasy sports side, Bill Hornbuckle nudged me about three or four times, in my ribs here, look, yes I think I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill. You don't want to know what I\u2019d say.","Bill Hornbuckle","Yes I know.","Jim Murren","But only if I want you to know what I\u2019d say.","Bill Hornbuckle","Thank you, Jim. And look obviously with a lot of people it is something we have all followed with great interest, we will continue to do so, we absolutely want to see the states rights issue to be clear, it's a program that we -- because we do all things in social gaming at some point we would like to participate, but the states need to opine on the right consumer protections and setting it up so a company ours can participate. Right now obviously it\u2019s in a grey area and overtime and we hope relatively, quickly because it has been a lot of attention on the space, there will be some clarity around with states like Massachusetts, Illinois, and others that we are in, want to do with it. But we are actively engaged in the story, AGA is engaged in the story and following it, and we would like to be participated and helpful, because we think it\u2019s meaningful in the long run.","Joel Simkins","Thank you.","Jim Murren","And I like sports too Bill.","Bill Hornbuckle","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Jim Murren","Well thank you everyone for joining and for any follow-up questions please reach out to my office and we\u2019ll get back to any and all of you as quickly as we can today. Thank you.","Dan D'Arrigo","Thank you very much.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Joining the call from the company today are: Jim Murren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dan D'Arrigo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Grant Bowie, Chief Executive Officer of MGM China Holdings, Limited. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mrs. Sarah Rogers. Please go ahead.","Sarah Rogers","Good morning, and welcome to MGM Resorts International's fourth quarter earnings call. This call is being broadcast live on the Internet at mgmresorts.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website. We furnished our press release on Form 8-K to the SEC this morning.","On this call, we will make forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws. Actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in today's press release and in our periodic filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website.","Finally, please note that this presentation is being recorded.","With that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. This is a good day for the MGM team. Our U.S. wholly-owned operations achieved its best EBITDA cash flow in 6 years. Last year, CityCenter's cash flow from resort operations was a new record. And at MGM China, even though it's a challenging market, we also had a record year as well in 2014.","And we closed the year with very solid fourth quarter results. Our wholly-owned domestic resorts reported its best fourth quarter since 2007. Quarterly revenues and cash flow both grew 5% year-over-year, driven by our Strip property growth. CityCenter resort operations results were impacted by a really tough hold at ARIA, but the campus as a whole continued to improve in the quarter.","At MGM China, of course, Grant will get you more detail in this on the fourth quarter, but I'm pleased with that property's market outperformance and its ability to grow margins year-over-year in what is obviously a very challenging macro environment there. Today, MGM China announced a special dividend of $400 million and will also recommend $120 million final dividend as part of our regular dividend policy. We have again demonstrated our commitment of sharing our returns with our shareholders with the declaration of these dividends.","Really, 2014 was a great year for the company. And I'd just like to take a couple of moments to highlight the progress we have made in that very busy, busy year. First, the property improvements to our Strip properties. We completed the new Strip frontage at Monte Carlo and at New York-New York. And as you can see, if you've been out here, those properties look beautiful and are seeing a lift as they've reported increases of 9% and 14% cash flow growth, respectively, during the quarter.","Also, we've had a couple of new additions to Las Vegas, and I'm proud to say that Shake Shack opened last December and is already the second-highest grossing Shake Shack in the portfolio's history, second only to Times Square. We're well underway with the development of that entertainment district. Early returns are obviously favorable to us, and that's the park between those 2 properties, which will lead up to the country's best new arena.","The MGM AEG arena financing was completed last year, and construction is flying along. And it's anticipated to open in the spring of next year. Suite sales and sponsorship sales are progressing extremely well, and it's shocking how fast that arena is going up. You should come out and take a peek.","At Mandalay Bay, the remodel of The Hotel into the Delano was completed in September, and our volumes and pace for that property look extremely promising. In fact, Delano had double-digit revenue growth in the month of January. Also based on the success and demand for our convention business, as you know, we commenced the expansion of Mandalay's convention area, and that will add another 350,000 square feet of meeting space when completed in the fourth quarter this year. And since announcing that expansion, Mandalay has experienced a really nice uptick in forward convention bookings, and we've signed several LOIs for new business going into that new expansion area.","MGM Cotai construction is progressing really well. MGM Cotai, as you know, will be almost 2x the size of our existing property, and that allows us to develop far more amenities for our guests. The Spectacle's undulating ceiling of glass is being built as we speak, and we're continuing to refine the technology and entertainment experience there. The showroom represents an unprecedented opportunity to extend our industry-leading entertainment expertise as we will create a versatile stage and venue capable of evolving with MGM Cotai as its destination entertainment options grow and mature.","This will be a first-in-the-market type of entertainment venue, and we are really excited to display it to the world. We remain on track to open this resort in the world's largest gaming market in the fall of 2016.","MGM Diaoyutai, our joint venture in China, continues to make really great progress. We had our best year ever at MGM Sanya, the hotel in Hainan Island. We opened a hotel in Chengdu. We topped off the Bellagio in Shanghai, and we've recently signed an agreement to build a Bellagio in Beijing.","And on the East Coast, we're developing 2 new resorts that will soon have a strong collection -- that will mean we'll soon have a strong collection of resorts on the Eastern corridor. This, of course, will allow us to expand our brand presence in that region and provide even better cross-marketing opportunities, and we've seen those results accrue to the benefit of our Detroit and Mississippi properties back here in Las Vegas.","Last summer, we broke ground on MGM National Harbor in Maryland, and that remains on track to open in the fall of 2016. And we expect that resort to be one of the most successful U.S. resorts outside of Las Vegas when it's open.","In Springfield, the referendum is now behind us, and we can move forward. The land has now been assembled, and we are commencing site work. We're anticipating the ground breaking this spring and targeting a second half of 2017 opening for MGM Springfield.","And in New Jersey, MGM was re-licensed in September and approved to regain our stake in Borgata, the best-in-class end market leading property in Atlantic City.","So I'm pleased with our accomplishments and successes in 2014 and expect that we will grow off that base here in 2015. In fact, we already are at our wholly-owned resorts. We have just accomplished the highest net revenue and EBITDA January since the peak back in 2007, and we've seen broad-based growth across all of our room categories and in our casinos.","And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to Dan to talk about our operating results and our financial position.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. In Las Vegas, we achieved 6% growth in both revenues and EBITDA. During the quarter, we increased margins by approximately 10 basis points. And during the quarter, we saw a broad-based revenue growth in casino, hotel and food and beverage. Each of these segments were up mid-single digits at our Strip properties.","Our properties continue to benefit from increased occupancy, up 3 percentage points year-over-year, driven by a higher convention mix in the quarter. This allowed us to grow fourth quarter Strip REVPAR by 7%, exceeding our guidance of 5%. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of REVPAR growth for our company. In fact, 2014 was our highest convention mix ever in the history of our company at over -- slightly over 17% of our room nights in 2014. As we look into 2015, it is our expectation based on current convention bookings to meet or slightly beat the level attained in 2014. Over 90% of that target is contracted and on the books, and over 60% of all of our future bookings are now being comprised of future corporate meeting events.","Looking at the first quarter, we expect REVPAR growth of approximately 2% to 3%. This is a significant accomplishment, given we are growing over the 14% REVPAR growth in the prior year's quarter. I'm very proud of the sales and yield management teams for this extraordinary effort, and all of our operating units for putting forth a great result in 2014 and off to a tremendous start thus far in 2015.","Moving over to CityCenter. CityCenter resort operations EBITDA decreased by 16% year-over-year on a tough hold comparison, as Jim mentioned, at ARIA. ARIA reported EBITDA of $60 million lower year-over-year, driven by a 450 basis point decrease in table games hold, as well as lower volumes.","ARIA's hotel business continues to improve, as seen by the 9% REVPAR increase year-over-year, driven by a 20% increase in convention room nights. This higher convention mix allowed ARIA to achieve its best-ever catering and banquet revenue in the quarter.","Vdara had a record fourth quarter EBITDA, driven by a 13% increase in REVPAR. Crystals recorded $11 million in EBITDA during the quarter, another strong performance at Crystals.","As we announced in late December, CityCenter was able to record a global settlement related to the outstanding Perini and Harmon claims. There are several moving parts to the settlement, and due to the accounting literature, CityCenter was required to record a $39 million charge in the fourth quarter and anticipates a $160 million gain in the first quarter of 2015.","Moving on to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year was approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $546 million was at MGM China. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion in available liquidity under our corporate revolver and approximately $1.1 billion in excess cash on hand in the U.S. as a result of our November 2014 bond offering. We believe this available liquidity allows us to deal not only with near-term maturities, but with our upcoming growth initiatives.","MGM China had approximately $1.5 billion in revolver availability at the end of the quarter and currently today. CityCenter cash at the end of the quarter was $410 million, which includes $143 million of restricted cash. And total debt at CityCenter at the end of the quarter was approximately $1.5 billion.","During the fourth quarter, we invested approximately $114 million, 1-1-4, bringing our full year capital -- CapEx related to domestic operations to $387 million. We also invested $77 million on National Harbor and MGM Springfield during the quarter, bringing full year CapEx on these developments to $138 million. In addition, we invested approximately $48 million in our arena and hospitality joint ventures.","To help with your 2015 modeling, we expect our CapEx to be as follows: Here at our wholly-owned domestic resorts, we expect to spend approximately $425 million in 2015, which includes a room renovation at Mandalay Bay for their main hotel tower and suites; convention expansion at Mandalay as well, as Jim mentioned, the 350,000 square-foot expansion; and our continued development of our park and entertainment district between Monte Carlo and New York-New York.","Our development projects will total approximately $500 million in 2015, with National Harbor making up about $375 million; MGM Springfield about $80 million; and investments in joint ventures, predominantly our arena investments, of about $50 million.","During the fourth quarter, MGM China spent approximately $14 million at MGM Macau and $37 million on our Cotai development. For the year, MGM China spent approximately $45 million on MGM Macau and $275 million on Cotai, bringing the total investment to date of approximately $500 million, excluding land and cap interest and development fees at MGM Cotai. In 2015, MGM China is expected to spend $100 million on MGM China and $1.1 billion on MGM Cotai.","That concludes my report. I'll turn it over to Grant Bowie.","Grant R. Bowie","Thanks, Dan, and good morning. So 2014 produced a number of records for MGM China. EBITDA grew by 5% to $850 million, and margins increased 140 basis points. These results were achieved despite the many challenges confronting us in Macau, requiring us to constantly adapt and respond to the rapidly changing business environment.","We're certainly not immune to the challenges in the Macau market, but I do believe we have a robust and responsive strategies that will allow us to create opportunities for future growth.","For the fourth quarter, MGM China reported net revenue and EBITDA down 22% year-on-year, while the overall market was actually down 25%. Our EBITDA margin, though, was up 10 basis points year-over-year to 25.8%, thanks to growth in the main floor business and cost controls.","MGM China, in fact, is the only Macau concessionaire that recorded growth in the main floor business during the fourth quarter. Our main floor table games revenue increased by 19% year-over-year, while the overall market was, in fact, down 9%. Our outperformance in the segment, which has been our strength for a number of quarters, is a result of our relentless execution of strategy and our focus on our customer experiences and operating performance.","Given the current market trends, which have seen revenue migration from the VIP to the mass segment, we have reallocated capacity such that now over half of our tables are now allocated to the main floor, the result of this being that the mass business contributed approximately 75% of our profit in the fourth quarter. This compares to approximately 60% in 2013.","VIP table games revenue decreased by 39% year-over-year. This was due to the market being down 32%, and for us, lower hold, which was 2.6% versus 2.8% in the prior period.","We are committed to being a high-quality operator, and continuously upgrading the hospitality and gaming experiences for our customers is essential. To remain competitive, we need to -- we plan to invest approximately $100 million, as Dan indicated, in capital this coming year. Our future capital projects for MGM Macau include: a redesigned main floor layout to improve traffic flow and operating efficiencies; as well, we'll be introducing a range of non-gaming products in the form of over 15 new retail outlets; and reconceptualize food and beverage offerings to add capacity and diversity.","MGM Cotai construction continues to pick up pace, as Jim has mentioned, and the project is on schedule to open in the fall of 2016.","Construction of the hotel towers has now reached the 16th floor, and the progress is moving quickly. The first sections of curtain wall have been installed for quality and acceptance, and full-scale fixing of the curtain wall will commence next month.","We are keen to get our property open, as MGM China has the greatest potential to grow in the market with the addition of our second property. MGM Cotai will nearly quadruple our room base and triple our gross floor area, which will allow us to expand our product offering into the retail and entertainment. These will all create opportunities for earnings and margin improvement.","While we're gearing up in Cotai, we're also loading teams around our second property while developing the skill set of our local team. At MGM, we firmly believe that it is important to groom and nurture the local talent. Currently, more than 80% of our management team at MGM Macau are local employees, and we are looking to grow this percentage as we grow our business.","We have always been committed to grow the business with our local team members. And in fact, over the past 12 months, we have internally promoted over 700 of our local team members.","And with that, I'd like to turn back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Joseph Murren","Well, thank you, Grant. Our largest market, of course, Las Vegas, is showing solid signs of growth. Visitation was up 4% last year to a new record of over 41 million visitors. The LVCVA has the goal of reaching 45 million visitors over the next few years and growing our international mix of those visitors from about 20% now to 30%. We think these objectives are achievable.","We do not expect any new capacity in the market in the near future, and airlift is scheduled to be up about 3% for the first quarter. Obviously, the U.S. consumer is feeling better. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 5 years, consumer confidence is at new highs, house prices are recovering and of course, energy costs have been cut dramatically.","Remember that 70% of our Las Vegas revenues are non-gaming. Consumers are spending more, and this really helps, particularly our core properties. And I can tell you that for MGM, 2015 is off to a very strong start in Las Vegas. For example, in January, the Consumer Electronics Show had record attendance. And during that conference, the MGM portfolio had 2 of its best hotel revenue days of all time, and we continue to build off of our strong base of convention room nights.","The next month, in February, the Super Bowl drew the second-largest crowd in the city's history for that event. And later this week, we kick off Chinese New Year's, which is, of course, always a major holiday for people that travel to Las Vegas from around the world, and of course, for Macau as well.","MGM continues to invest where we see opportunity. We're really excited about the venues we have opening this year. Rock in Rio will debut in May. There may even be a certain fight that month in May, Bill. Our convention center expansion will open this year. That will have a profound impact on Mandalay Bay next year. The arena, it is hard to understate the impact of the neighborhood of that 20,000-seat arena. And of course, we own the neighborhood on that side of the Strip. And that opens next year, next spring.","And beyond Las Vegas, we're really excited about the targeted developments we have underway, including, obviously, MGM Cotai, MGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield.","And so with that, operator, we have plenty of time for questions, and I'd like to turn it over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Joseph Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have 2 questions, one relates to Las Vegas and then my second one relates to Macau. With respect to the Las Vegas Strip -- and I understand your comments were quite positive in terms of what you're seeing so far, the first month plus this year. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the Baccarat volume side? I know the last 5 months, the Strip had some squishy results. Some of that is maybe comparison-related, and it looks like you took some share in the fourth quarter. But can you talk about what you're seeing with that Baccarat consumer? And then my second question on Macau and maybe for you as well, Jim. Can you talk about what the dividend policy and maybe the leverage -- balance sheet leverage strategy is there with respect to Macau?","James Joseph Murren","Okay, Joe, let me tackle that. January, we had a very strong Baccarat month. Our volume was up -- well, it was up double digits in January. In fact, overall table games were up high single digits in the month of January. And so I'd say we're off to a good start there. That said, just so you kind of understand the frame of the issue, because China is obviously topical, we've looked at this. Here in Las Vegas, our cash flow exposure to Chinese Baccarat play is in the low single digits. Less than 5% of our EBITDA comes from China here in Las Vegas in terms of Baccarat. It's important, and as I said, it was up nicely overall in January. But I just wanted to frame the quantum of that for you. And I think the second half, the question goes to Grant.","Grant R. Bowie","Joe, so the issue on the dividend, in terms of -- I'm assuming you're talking about go-forward leverage, Joe?","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Exactly, exactly.","Grant R. Bowie","Okay. So clearly, we are going to maintain the annual commitment, the annual bonus -- the annual dividend. The bigger issue obviously is going to be the go-forward special dividend, and obviously, that will be mapped out against our cash requirements. We're still looking very positively at being able to generate significant cash, and I'm sure that all of our shareholders would see us being able to distribute back. But that will obviously need to be determined on a cash by cash basis. So we continue to reaffirm the commitment to our existing policy, with the board addressing opportunities for special dividends as they see it as appropriate.","Operator","Our next question is from Harry Curtis from Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Jim, let's start with you. Let's go back to 2007, when your properties generated about $2 billion worth of EBITDA. Still a fairly wide gap between what you generated in '14 and that peak. What are the drivers going to be to help you close that gap? And specifically, how important is the casino piece in 2015 and '16 versus how big it was then?","James Joseph Murren","Okay, Harry, let me take a stab at that. Yes, those were the good old days when Jim didn't have gray hair. You're talking about the '07 time, right? So if you break up our portfolio here between maybe luxury and non-luxury, the non-luxury is outperforming right now the luxury, right? So the core -- if you look at core REVPARs, you look at core cash flows, they're growing more rapidly than luxury because, obviously, they were the ones that were most devastated by the recession. We had just tremendous declines on cash flows at our core properties. Properties that were doing $80 million a year got down to $20 million, and the $150 million got down to $80 million. And it was just a devastation to our cash flows. They are doing better now, and we expect them to continue to improve. You probably saw that in the fourth quarter, their margins were up almost a couple hundred basis points and they were up almost 100 basis points for the year. And we expect them to continue to improve, but they're still 50% off of where they were back in 2007. And that means that's about a $300 million EBITDA opportunity if we were to restore the core properties' cash flows to where they were in '07. I think that is an achievable goal. If the city-wide convention market continues to improve, if the LVCVA does as it wants and expands and improves, as we expand our convention business and the consumer generally improves, that's a big opportunity for us. And that, frankly, is the best sense of how the U.S. consumer is doing, is right there. The luxury properties are also down from their peaks, and that's a combination of high-end gaming and the food and beverage side. We feel like we can improve on both of those, and we don't know if we're going to get fully back to where we were in '07 on the luxury side. It was pretty heady back then. But people are starting to spend money remarkably here. Corey Sanders showed me a check at Prime, which I couldn't believe. Corey, it was a group that spent $300,000?","Corey I. Sanders","Yes.","James Joseph Murren","$300,000 for dinner at Prime. That's a pretty good check. You would have liked the wine, Harry. And we haven't seen that in a long time. So I'm not saying that's a trend. But to get the kind of cash flow numbers the luxury properties got up and down the Strip, you're going to have to see that type of abundant spending. We don't see that. We're not predicting that, but we do predict that we'll be able to continue to grow REVPAR in our luxuries, we do predict that they'll benefit from the convention business and that they'll get back a lot of the cash flow they lost from that peak. So if I were to model out over the next few years, I think we're lifting off operationally on the core properties. We held up pretty well in the luxuries. I think we'll grow there, but I think the delta will be better in core.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I'm guessing that dinner was not a Nomura-sponsored dinner?","James Joseph Murren","No, it was not.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So then my second question speaks to or addresses the issue of margins in Las Vegas. I would have expected a bit better performance on the margin side in the fourth quarter given your revenue growth. Can you talk to why they might have been held back and your expectations for margin expansion this year?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Sure, Harry, this is Dan. I think when you look at the fourth quarter, clearly, we had a pretty tough comp in the prior year's fourth quarter, given some accruals and some different things that benefited the fourth quarter in '13. So on a year-over-year basis, that kind of held us back. I think when you kind of look at our overall margin improvement, we are improving margins. We're going to continue to be focused on improving margins. And I think as you kind of look at the opportunities as we go forward in terms of cost structure and driving top line, we're in a good position as we look into 2015 and beyond. And really, when you look at the last couple of years and how we've been able to improve margin in '13 and '14, we've been able to really kind of drive roughly about a 50% flow-through overall in the business. And as we said before, it's really a longer-term view than either a monthly or a quarter-by-quarter view. And we're pretty proud of that accomplishment over the past couple of years. We're going to keep our head down and stay focused on driving margin improvement in 2015 and beyond.","James Joseph Murren","I was just saying, correct me if I'm wrong, Dan, but if you look at the average of the flow-through in the fourth quarter of this past year and the one in the year before, it's about 50%, 48%, 50%. And the flow-through over the last couple of years, if you looked at the average of last 2 years, it's been about 50%.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","About 50%.","James Joseph Murren","So it's -- there'll be ups and downs, but 50% is still a pretty good benchmark. It just -- and if you look at the core properties, obviously, they did better.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So using a mid -- in Vegas, using a mid- to high single digit EBITDA growth, assuming roughly 5%, 6% top line growth is not unreasonable then?","James Joseph Murren","No.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","No.","Operator","Our next question is from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jim, in your -- I don't remember if it's Jim or Dan, sorry. But in your prepared -- I think it was you, Dan. In your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the convention stack for 2015, and I -- you talked a lot about booking. I was just hoping you could tell us a bit about rate. This actually might even be for Corey.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Yes, when you look at the bookings, obviously, I did mention that, that we got about 90% of our 2015 goal contracted on the books, and that's pacing at roughly about a mid-single digit increase year-over-year. And I think as we kind of fill in some of the shoulder periods and weaker periods on the convention side within the year -- for the year, our goal is to continue to kind of drive that rate.","James Joseph Murren","You might also mention, Dan, the mix of convention business, right? So we have a lot of it already booked. But increasingly, corporates are becoming a higher percentage of our bookings. It was under 50% a couple of years ago. It was like 50%, Sarah, last year?","Sarah Rogers","Yes.","James Joseph Murren","And now 60% of our future bookings are corporates. And clearly, that's a positive sign for the market and for us from a revenue perspective for that group business.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just when you talked about the convention booking mix being the highest at over 17% for 2014, if you remove CON\/AGG, what would that have looked like?","James Joseph Murren","You want to do that? I think you have that, don't you?","Sarah Rogers","Well, I have REVPAR -- sorry, maybe you can hear me better now. So I mean in terms of the percentage of room nights, we don't have that handy. But I can tell you that we're able to achieve a similar convention mix this year, and that's lapping the strong first quarter because of CON\/AGG.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","It still would've been a record year-over-year when you look at it overall from a historical standpoint. Remember, our prior peak period was in the low 16% mix. So we still would've been above that level, excluding CON\/AGG in '14.","James Joseph Murren","And did we give the first quarter mix, Dan?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","We have not.","James Joseph Murren","Do you want that?","Sarah Rogers","It's about 23% convention mix in the first quarter.","James Joseph Murren","And what was the last year?","Sarah Rogers","That's similar on a year-over-year basis.","James Joseph Murren","So that's kind of good depth. So our convention mix in the first quarter this year will be about 23%. That's what it was last year, with CON\/AGG, so you could get a sense that things are -- we've been able to work around CON\/AGG not being here.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, very helpful. And then, Jim, you talked about this a little bit before, but your core properties did better than expected in the quarter. The luxury properties lagged, you talked about that. You also talked about some things that you're doing in the convention and meeting area -- arena that should improve that. It looks like you're kind of working your way towards that improvement just given the stack, but anything else you want to add there?","James Joseph Murren","Well, on the core properties, I think that we're taking the view that these properties that we own on the core side can all do better than they are right now. And the first start was with New York-New York and Monte Carlo because they're center Strip, and we felt that there was a lot we could do to have an immediate impact. And we are seeing that impact. You look at the traffic counts going into Monte Carlo today versus where they were before we started this, it's significant. We're up 20%, 30% in terms of traffic counts of people walking into Monte Carlo this January versus last January as a result of what we did there. We're seeing high slot handles at Monte Carlo. We see really good room revenue at Monte Carlo in January. So that has to be largely due to what we had done in front of that building. In the same kind of story, you could see it in New York-New York. Shake Shack isn't the only success there. We've seen big volume increases at Nine Fine Irishmen and our other venues as well. So our strategy will be to take a look at these properties and find ways where we could deploy some capital with an outsized return, with the idea that more people go to those kind of properties than any other kind in Las Vegas. The mid-market properties are the bread and butter of Las Vegas. It's not the part that a lot of people talk about a lot about because it's not Baccarat, it's not the big shows, but it's where you can make the most money over time. So we're looking at Excalibur and further improvements to Monte Carlo, in Luxor, but not in dramatic, major capital type of projects, but in ways that we can improve those core properties. And I think that the non-gaming side is going to help us a lot. This arena is going to help that part of the Strip an awful lot. It will be programmed over 120 nights a year, and that's going to draw a lot of traffic up and down that part of the boardwalk area. In terms of other capital projects we're looking at, they're not big ones. They're room remodels that make sense. I guess we're doing Monte Carlo -- I mean, Mandalay Bay now, right, Sarah? We're really encouraged that when we do these room remodels more intelligently, meaning we don't spend quite as much and we get more impact for that, we do get a revenue impact and an EBITDA impact right away. So the strategy is to put capital into these properties to make them more relevant, to capture more than our fair share of market. And if you've done some of the analysis, you know that we have an outsized share of market in slots and in any metric relative to their competitive set. We think we can increase the gap there and be able to integrate those core properties better within our luxury properties through our loyalty programs.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Jones of Union Gaming.","Christopher E. Jones - Union Gaming Group, LLC","Just staying on topic on the core properties. Could you talk a little bit more about what else is driving it, in terms of your M life program or even perhaps if you're seeing just better economic lift from that region as well? Certainly, it's good to see that, and we've seen some pretty strong stock performance there as well. And then also, just out of Macau, if you could talk a little bit about your CapEx spend over there, where you're looking to, I guess, redo the main floor, some timing on that as to what the impact might be to the main floor from the refresh?","Corey I. Sanders","Chris, it's Corey. With regards to the core properties and lift, I think there's a few factors that are definitely driving it. Lower gas prices helped. The fact that we have such a solid convention base, which fills our luxury properties, and the fact that there's a 3% lift in air seats also helps those properties. And then we do see a lot of benefit with the regional properties filling casino room nights in the core properties. So I think all those things are beginning to help those properties drive rate.","Operator","Our next question is from Shaun...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Hang on. Grant, did you want to take the Macau question?","Grant R. Bowie","Sure. So Chris, we're working through the process. We're looking at hopefully getting the work commenced in probably the third quarter. And as you correctly note, what we're doing is making sure that we protect ourselves in terms of any revenue loss. So what we wanted to do first is put in all the incremental gaming that doesn't actually take away from anything we've got. So that's really the focus is to maximize that and then minimize any significant impact. At this point in time, we're actually pretty confident that we should be able to keep all the productive capacity that we currently have available. And then once we have obviously completed it, we'll be adding more capacity into the floor.","Operator","Our next question is from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a little bit about 2 subjects. The first is just, in general, your cash tax position heading into 2015 from 2014. And then secondarily, we're starting to see a lot more creative financing structures as it relates to regional gaming assets. And I'm curious, would you guys -- I think you've spoken before that those types of transactions may not make sense for the overall business. But I'm curious if you would consider that either for any of your regional gaming properties or maybe some sort of creative financing solutions to help de-risk the properties in Massachusetts and Maryland, given the size of those investments.","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Shaun, this is Dan. As far as cash taxes, we will pay some taxes. It's pretty minimal this year in terms of our overall cash taxes. It's probably less than $50 million in the year as far as our cash taxes this year.","James Joseph Murren","And I think your next part were some of the other kind of corporate strategies, for example, like REITs that Penn pursued last year and Pinnacle looks like it's pursuing right now. We are -- we look at everything. I think that those who have followed us a lot know that we're an active corporate finance organization here. We've bought properties, we've sold properties, we've done just about everything that we can -- that's been done out there. The concept of converting gaming assets to REITs is not a new one. It was very actively discussed before the recession. In fact, a couple of companies pursued that and then canceled those plans. And more recently, the dialogue is there again. We look at this all the time. We're pitched by every bank that is out there in terms of whether or not we should do that. And there's some merit to it. We believe that our assets are undervalued around the portfolio of our assets. And so we should -- we believe that as we're working for the shareholders, we should explore every opportunity as they come across our desk. And so I'd have to say, there's nothing definitive. There's nothing to report, but we do look at these type of corporate transactions. We do know there's great value in cross-marketing in the gaming industry. And one would know -- you just have to look at the fourth quarter, or if we could show you the January numbers in Detroit, which is great, we're doing great in Detroit in January and down in Mississippi. And the amount of business we get between our regional properties and our core properties here in Las Vegas is growing rapidly. So we do know that there's value in a portfolio of properties. Whether we have to own them all is the question that you're asking. We don't have the answers to that at this point in time. But I have to tell you that we're shareholder-oriented. We look at this stuff all the time. We are going to continue to look at it. I see some challenges around it from a tax perspective, but that doesn't mean that can't be overcome. And so we're going to continue to explore them.","Operator","Our next question is from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When we look at the last couple of quarters, obviously, you guys have pretty much consistently been in a 2-year stack REVPAR range of about 8%. And when we look at the 1Q guidance on top of a plus 14% last year, it shows obviously a meaningful uptick, as you guys have obviously filled in the convention hall pretty nicely. When we think about the rest of the year, do you kind of look at the 1Q as being maybe the trough year-over-year REVPAR growth quarter, just given the difficult comparison?","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","Carlo, it's Dan. I think you're spot-on as we look at 2015. Clearly, March will be a tough comp, given the impact CON\/AGG had from a year-over-year standpoint. And as we've mentioned previously, it's our goal, and we think we can do it, to grow each quarter on a year-over-year basis. And first quarter, given that tougher comp, will probably be the trough quarter out of all 4.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just really quickly for Grant. Grant, if you could just comment a little bit on maybe how the reclassifications in Macau have gone thus far and what your plans are on a go-forward basis?","Grant R. Bowie","So in terms of, obviously, just maximizing opportunities, we will just keep moving product into the mass market to the extent that we see that as being incremental and as long as we can create more floor space to actually achieve that. At this point in time, as I think everyone is seeing, the jacket market is soft, and we don't see any significant opportunities for that to change. So I think the focus is clearly moving that into the mass environment.","Operator","Our next question is from Joel Simkins of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Joel H. Simkins - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have 2 quick questions. Jim, you sort of referenced this potential Pacquiao-Mayweather fight sometime in the second quarter. I guess, what are your expectations around that? What does that at least mean in the short term? And then secondly, I'd say, a longer-term question. There's been some fits and starts around the couple of proposed developments around the Strip. Are your expectations that we would not see any meaningful supply growth on the Strip until at least the end of the decade?","James Joseph Murren","Okay, Bill's like, you're going to get in trouble, Jim. Listen, I'm just responding to newspaper rumors. I'm just -- look, we're holding the date. We're holding the date on May 2 for a fight, and we hope it's a big, big fight. And if it's the fight that we hope it is, it'll be the biggest fight. And if it's that fight, then our REVPAR in May at the MGM Grand is going to go through the roof. So -- but we have a pretty good calendar this year of events, both concerts and fights. We know Mayweather is going to fight at some point in time, right, Bill?","William Joseph Hornbuckle","That's right.","James Joseph Murren","And he will -- so he will fight. And so we're working as hard as anyone that cares about boxing on that very event. And I could just say that we're working very hard, and we're all hopeful. I have to say that also, the events this year are going to -- they're going to be really fun for Las Vegas in general. And what we're up to on our festival lot across from Luxor, what we're up to at Rock in Rio, what Caesars' is doing behind on the LINQ, there are some new events this year that are going to drive incremental traffic from some people that don't typically come to Las Vegas, which I think, over time, is really good. I'm struggling with what's going to happen out here from a capacity perspective, frankly. We have heard for many quarters that Genting was going to break ground, and they have not. And I remember saying last quarter, we hope they do. And we do hope that because we do believe they'll drive some incremental business. Steve Wynn very famously said many years ago the worst neighbor is a vacant lot, and we ascribe to that theory. So we hope that they build. There's no evidence that we see out here being active in the market in terms of engaging consultants, architects, urban planners that, that is going to happen anytime soon. But we hope that, that does. And of course, James Packer and Andrew Pascal are working on a project. I haven't gotten an update from them on that. My guess is here we are in '15 already, that nothing opens until beyond 2018. And it could even be later than that. And it's not necessarily a certainty that a new property opens at all. And so I can tell you, we're not going to build a new property, and I doubt Caesars is going to building a new property. And I don't think Boyd is going to go onto the Strip, and I don't think Steve Wynn or Sheldon Adelson will build properties. So I think the capacity is fairly well defined over the next 5 to 10 years. I really think that. And meanwhile, I think the LVCVA numbers of driving to 45 million tourists is a reasonable expectation. And I don't think we can fully understand or appreciate what the expansion to the Las Vegas Convention Center will do for visitation. I think that would be an interesting analysis to do. When they expanded the convention center in the past, in years past, we saw a quantum change in convention attendance. The -- Rossi Ralenkotter, who runs the convention center, has a list of conventions that he could get if he had that expansion, and it's a big list that would generate hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental revenue to the city. So I'm just looking at the landscape broadly with a fairly limited amount of supply, if any at all, with some ambient growth in the consumer confidence and activity driving traffic here, the unexpected benefit of much lower gas prices, which you really see if they stay anywhere near this level during the summer, you're going to see traffic to Las Vegas we haven't seen in 10 years. The fact that the airlines are healthy -- Southwest is in our local paper today talking about growing more flights into Las Vegas. You know Southwest is the largest carrier into Las Vegas and our largest partner. And the fact that these kind of non-gaming events, festivals, music festivals, concerts, drive a lot of traffic here and they spend money. That's why we're feeling very good about this year and next year. You've been reading a little bit about potentially a hockey team coming to Las Vegas. Can you imagine what would happen to Las Vegas if a professional sports team was here? And so far so good. The potential owner is trying to get to 10,000 season tickets. In about a couple of days, he got 5,000 seats, and he's a couple of thousand seats over that right now. So he is well on his way of demonstrating to the NHL that there's a strong fan support here in Las Vegas. We're going to be, I'm sure, we're going to be a regional site for March Madness once we get the arena up and running. We do the Pac-12 basketball tournament already at the MGM, and it's a big hit. So if you think about over the next few years, sports is going to be a big component to the growth of the city, and we, of course, are going to be the leading player in that. And these concerts and festivals are going to be another major growth. We are the major player there. And the convention business is going to be a major part of the growth, and Las Vegas Sands and MGM are the biggest there. And so that's why we're feeling good about the future over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Wieczynski of Stifel.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Jim, so one of the properties you haven't talked about is The Mirage. Again, it's not a huge property for you guys, but it seems like that property is always kind of popping up here with rumors it's potentially for sale. But you guys just started a pretty extensive renovation project that seems like it's going to take a while to complete. So I guess maybe how do you view that property longer term in terms of your portfolio? And then also maybe talk about the decision to remove, seems like a lot of high-end play, from that property as well.","James Joseph Murren","Yes, The Mirage got pummeled by hold in the fourth quarter. It was -- I don't think it could have done worse from a hold perspective, but we are putting money into that iconic property. One of the things we're doing in there, and you've noticed, is that it really -- what Mirage struggles from is the fact that it doesn't have enough to keep people there throughout the night. And so we're adding -- we're putting in a center bar and a lounge, and we've changed out some of the restaurants. We have a couple more ideas in that regard. It's got so many great elements to it. It's got probably arguably the best villa product in the city still for those who like the garden villas, and many of our customers, particularly the ones that value their privacy, love those villas. It's got 2 theaters, it's got a decent amount of convention space, it's got a great location and so -- and of course, a great brand name. And it is the sports hub for all of our properties. So that -- the Mirage sports book generates more volume than anyone else out here because it's -- we hub all of our sports activity through The Mirage. But yes, it has been rumored to be on the sale block for many, many years, really since 2000. My point on that would be we're not in charge of owning all these properties. These properties are owned by the shareholders, all of them are. And we look at anything that will generate value for shareholders. And we're not blindly in love with any of our properties. So I don't -- I can't say for sure that there'll be a sale on the Strip. But I will say this, is that we believe that if we continue to strategically invest in all these properties, their cash flows are going to go up. And sales are based on multiples and levels of cash flow. We sold Treasure Island to Phil Ruffin, who's a great man, and he is very happy with that purchase. We sold it for $755 million. And I think he's happy that he bought it, and it's doing better now. When he bought it, the cash flows promptly plummeted because he bought it in the middle of the recession. But through hard work of his, he's brought back those cash flows to a level that, I'm not sure what they are now, but they're probably at or even exceeding where they were when we sold it to him. So my point is that our job is to drive as much cash flow into these properties as possible. To do that, we need to invest in them. If we get offers on any of our properties, we're obligated by our shareholders to look at them, and we will. And we have to look at it from a pretax basis. We have to look at it from an after-tax basis. We have to look at it relative to its strategic value. We have to look at it relative to how it fits in with the portfolio as it relates to market niche. And so I always am a believer of culling a portfolio. We've sold properties as recently as last year, and we'll continue -- small ones, but we sold them as recently as last year. So we'll look at that. The good news is that in an improving market with interest rates very low and interest in Las Vegas assets increasing, by both private equity firms like Blackstone with Cosmopolitan and by strategics, and the fact that we own 42,000 hotel rooms here in Las Vegas, 10 resorts, we have, I'm sure, the beneficiary of everyone's thinking as it relates to real estate. And that's good news for our shareholders.","Steven M. Wieczynski - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","One last question. Can you just comment real quick on M life, in general, and maybe how that program performed last year in terms of new sign-ups and also in terms of maybe the tier progressions, meaning folks going from Pearl or Sapphire up to your Gold and Platinum levels?","Sarah Rogers","It's Sarah. So our M life loyalty program, we saw market share gains in slots for the year, both at our Strip properties and at the regions. We had a record number of enrollments, that was up 9% year-over-year, and active M life members also grew up 8% year-over-year.","Operator","Our last question is from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just -- actually, it's a pretty quick question. On CityCenter, it looks like now the litigation is done, or it feels that way. Does this, in some way, pave the way for a broader recapitalization of that asset or outright sale? How should we be thinking about it now that this seems to be behind you, at least from the litigation front?","James Joseph Murren","Well, it feels like it's behind us, too, Steve, and it really feels like it's behind us. And we lived through it more painfully than you did. Yes, there are a couple of things that will emanate from that important resolution. One is, as you can see, when you're out here, we're taking down the Harmon. It's coming down, I think, a floor a week right now. It's at a nice pace, and it'll be down certainly by the end of the year and cleaned up. And we're going to put a nice fa\u00e7ade on that because it faces Crystals. But that's 2.2 acres of prime real estate on the Las Vegas Boulevard. So the CityCenter board is now engaged in trying to find the highest and best use of that property. So that -- we'll have meetings on that this year. As recently, Chris, as next week, I think we're having 1, or is it 2 weeks?","Christopher W. Nordling","25th.","James Joseph Murren","25th, yes. So we're having another kind of whiteboard session on what we should do there. Secondly, yes, there's an -- there are multiple opportunities of recapitalizing CityCenter. It's under-leveraged. It has cash on the balance sheet. It's got a couple of significant assets. And so Dan and his team are looking with our partners at Dubai, looking at a variety of ways that we could return value to owners, whether that be through sale of some parts of CityCenter or through dividends or through a recapitalization, we're looking at all that. And that really is going to usher in a new era for CityCenter. I think this is Phase 3. Phase 1 was struggling to get it open, Phase 2 was struggling to make it successful and profitable and cleaning up clouds of litigation and construction. And now we're in Phase 3 of an enterprise that's making a considerable amount of money, but has the capacity to make a lot more money, given its size and its quality. And how to maximize on that growing cash flow for the owners is the phase that we're in right now.","Okay. I think, Sarah, you said that was the last comment. So thank you all very much for joining us. And I have to apologize in advance that it's 55 degrees here in Las Vegas. As I'm looking at my son in Connecticut at 19 and my other son in Baltimore at 16, and I'm sure New York is no better than that and everywhere else. So...","Daniel J. D'Arrigo","But we're going to 80.","James Joseph Murren","But we're going to 80 today. So for those that haven't booked their flights for the weekend, it's better here than there. Enjoy yourselves, and we're always around for questions. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

","We had a very busy and productive quarter here at MGM with a lot of changes happening all with an eye to the future. As you all remember, we announced MGM 2020 back in January and we've been executing on that plan over the past few months.","We've made changes to our leadership, announced the addition of a pioneering new digital leader who will oversee growth and revenue, and we are progressing with Phase 1 of MGM 2020, which is expected to deliver $200 million of EBITDA in 2020.","This is a time of meaningful transition. We're laying the foundation for a strong future and making a lot of changes that will have a significant impact on how we operate. Corey will discuss 2020 in further detail in a bit. But first, a few key points I'd like to make. The first quarter came in slightly better than our expectations with consolidated net revenues up by 13% and adjusted EBITDA up 5%.","The last time we were together we highlighted both low hold and a tough comp in our Las Vegas Baccarat business. This was the primary driver of our year-over-year Strip EBITDA decline in the quarter, and clearly something that the market felt as a whole with Las Vegas Baccarat DGR down 32% year-over-year.","Our U.S. Regional properties showed tremendous strength and we are starting to see the fruits of our labor in Macau which had a nice quarter with a continued ramp-up of MGM Cotai.","I want to first say right up front that there is no change in our full-year outlook. We expect a strong second half to the year as we begin to drive financial benefits from 2020 as well as a good convention calendar.","And lastly, our long-term strategy and our 2020 goals of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA and consolidated free cash flow per share of $3.50 are unchanged. We also continue to work towards reducing our consolidated net leverage to 3 times to 4 times by year-end 2020. And we feel confident that we will meet these goals.","Let me get into the quarter a little bit. Here in Las Vegas, revenues were roughly flat year-over-year. Non-gaming revenues increased by 4%. We saw good performance in most areas including hotel with REVPAR up 3.7%. Food and beverage and entertainment were also robust, which we know speaks to the overall strength of the demand of the city at our properties.","Gaming revenues declined by 13% solely driven by high-end baccarat business. in fact, slots and non-bac table games had higher volumes and win year-over-year. Along with our non-gaming performance, this of course highlights the healthy environment we witnessed in the quarter.","We did mention in the fourth quarter call back in February that our baccarat business faced a very difficult comparison due to the timing of the holidays and a high hold comparison. Recall we had a record first quarter in baccarat last year, both in terms of volumes and win percentage.","Our baccarat business was lower this year due to fewer visits from certain Far East players and a much lower hold. The total impact to the quarter was approximately $35 million of EBITDA. This of course therefore was the main driver of our $46 million or 10% year-over-year decrease in Strip EBITDA.","Importantly, we're optimistic about the underlying health of Las Vegas. ARIA, which you know is not consolidated, for example, was particularly strong in the quarter with net revenues up 14% and Adjusted Property EBITDA up 29%. And including ARIA, we gained market share in overall table games.","We're also excited about the early performance of Park MGM as the property continues to ramp. It has already become a unique culinary destination and is bolstered by the programming at Park Theater and it's got of course a great location. Across the United States, we have many of the premier assets.","Our Regional properties continue to perform well in the first quarter with revenues up 21% and EBITDA up 24% benefiting from the inclusion of Springfield and Empire City. On a same-store basis, Regional revenues increased by 3% and Adjusted Property EBITDA was up 9%. Detroit had another great quarter with all-time record revenues and a record first quarter EBITDA.","Our Mississippi properties had an excellent quarter with EBITDA up 25%, as sports betting continues to drive visitation. National Harbor's EBITDA was up by 20% due to the strong reception of our expanded gaming floor and a continued focus on expense management. And Springfield ended up the quarter with a strong March and that property continues to ramp. MGM China's revenues grew by 23% to $734 million and Adjusted Property EBITDA was up 26% to $191 million.","By property, MGM Macau achieved EBITDA of $129 million, while Cotai continued its ramp with 18% growth quarter-over-quarter to $62 millions of EBITDA. We benefited from above average hold in the quarter of about $16 million in VIP. But nonetheless, we certainly showed good progress and gained market share for the third consecutive quarter.","And a big milestone for us was the extension of our sub-concession to June of 2022, which is now aligned with the rest of the market. We're grateful for the support of the Macau government and remain committed to the region's continued evolution into an international leisure and tourist destination.","In terms of our outlook for this year, it remains unchanged and we expect a good second half to the year as the benefits of MGM 2020 begin to materialize. Our trends other than baccarat have been positive. Convention bookings for the year remain in very good shape and we continue to benefit from the expansion at the MGM Grand convention center.","Our group business in 2020 is also shaping up well and this base on the books increases our confidence in Las Vegas. The entertainment calendar is exciting. T-Mobile will host Paul McCartney this summer and Canelo returns for the Cinco de Mayo fight this coming weekend. Park Theater is currently hosting Aerosmith and Janet Jackson is starting her Residency here in a few weeks. Of course, with the return of Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars later in the year, 2019 is looking outstanding.","Non-baccarat gaming trends also remain stable, and with respect to our Far East business, we've seen these dynamics before and we expect these trends to normalize over the coming quarters. We're focused on ramping up our new properties.","Late last month, we opened the Mansion villas at MGM Cotai to great response from our top players. This is similar to when we opened the Mansion here in Las Vegas back in 1998. We're seeing premium mass players who had not previously stayed at Cotai and they're staying longer too.","With all of our high-end amenities now operational, this will support growth in our VIP and premium mass business. We know we have more work to do there including fine tuning other elements such as F&B, retail and activating the spectacle. And we're also working on plans to build out some of the white space we have in the south tower, which could accommodate an extra 50 suites to 60 suites. We feel real great about Cotai and believe we will hit our ROI targets.","We will continue to ramp up Springfield and Park MGM and we have recently welcomed Empire City and Northfield Park into our portfolio. This strengthens our regional footprint and enhances our database and cross marketing strategy. We continue to see the benefit of increased diversification in our business and these highly targeted investments in both sports and technology.","We're a more balanced company than in any other time in our history with trophy assets in each of the markets in which we serve across the US and of course a meaningful and growing earnings contribution from Asia. We're excited about this balance and our ability to deliver for our shareholders because of it.","To ramp these assets is a key part of our plan to reach our $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA. The other major driver is MGM 2020. MGM 2020 is much more than a cost-cutting plan. It truly changes the way we operate and positions us for continued growth and success. One of the first changes we made as we started to implement MGM 2020 was promoting Corey Sanders to CFO.","As you all know, Corey has a tremendous history with MGM and in light of his operational expertise notably leading the profit growth plan, he is the right person to lead our efforts on MGM 2020.","And so with that, I'll hand it off to Corey to provide more details.","Corey Sanders","Thanks Jim.","And if I could turn people's attention to slides 14 through 18 in the earnings deck that has been posted on our website. Starting on Slide 14, we have been working on MGM 2020 for over a year now. When we announced the plan back in January, we set out to create a company that is streamlined and nimble and one that empowers leaders. In order to unleash innovation and support dynamic new ideas, we needed a new way of operating.","MGM 2020 is an evolution of our continuous improvement journey which began with the profit growth plan in 2015, now as you know is very successful, we targeted EBITDA enhancements of $300 million and ended up around $500 million. Between PGP and the announcement of MGM 2020, we have been busy standing up key centralized functions, redefining our service standards, training our employees on these standards, and opening four properties.","Through PGP, we laid the foundation for MGM 2020 as we installed the more centralized operating model which focused primarily on creating and sharing best practices across the enterprise. We also established our project management office.","MGM 2020 has two phases. Phase 1 of MGM 2020 is about scaling the centralized operating model to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. We are moving certain key functions out of the properties and into corporate centralized groups called centers of excellence.","Phase 2 of MGM 2020 is about driving a customer-centric strategy to accelerate revenue growth. This will be accomplished through better leveraging digital technology and capabilities plus an enhanced loyalty program. We will talk more in detail about Phase 2 in upcoming months.","Turning to Slide 52, this is a - 15, I'm sorry - this is an earnings call. So let's talk about some numbers. For Phase 1 of MGM 2020, we are targeting $200 million of EBITDA uplift in 2020 and we expect one-third of that this year. We expect $100 million from labor savings, which will be $80 million in fixed labor and $20 million in variable, $50 million from procurement opportunities and another $50 million from revenue optimization.","For Phase 2, we're targeting an additional $100 million uplift in 2021, and in total, this gets us $300 million of adjusted EBITDA uplift in 2021 compared to when we launched the program. We feel very confident that we will hit these targets. We have done it before with PGP and we will do it again.","For procurement savings, we are exploring opportunities in IT, facilities, marketing, and other areas. We're reducing SKUs in hotel and in food and beverage even beyond what we did during PGP. For revenue optimization, we are dynamically yielding our food and beverage covers and entertainment offerings. This is not a simple exercise just to increase price.","We're actually optimizing our inventory utilization by setting the right price to attract the right guest at the right time. This will result in increased covers and slow periods with gradual price increases during high demand periods. For variable labor within our labor initiative, we will enforce the new labor standards set by the COEs to optimize our labor costs and better utilize our existing workforce. We will also leverage technology for greater efficiencies.","These are fairly straightforward. So I want to spend more time discussing the profound change in our operating model. So, which brings us to Slide number 16, I mentioned earlier that we are scaling our operating model by moving certain key functions out of the properties and into corporate centers of excellence, which we refer to as COEs. We have 18 COEs including a COE for food and beverage, hotel, entertainment, casino, and marketing and revenue management among others.","Effectively leveraging our COEs will be the key to our operating model evolution, as we clearly defined and delineate the responsibilities of the COEs and the properties, to one, eliminate duplicate functions, to allow quicker decision making, to optimize our management spans and layers and to promote greater sharing and implementation of best practices across the company.","Under the old model, personnel at each property set and executed their own strategies and standards consistent with the overall company strategy. Under our new model, the COEs will set the strategy and standards. This allows properties to focus more time on execution and service. One of the implications of our new operating model is that we will need fewer managers on property creating labor savings.","Let's turn to Slide 17. And this will go more into detail in our new model. Our COEs now set business strategy for casino, hotel, food and beverage and other divisions that align with each property's brand and complements the portfolio. They perform market research and analytics for the portfolio and determine the approach to yielding our offerings.","Additionally, COEs working with the properties set standards for labor guidelines, service standards plus forecasting and accountability. The properties of course will have input into these decisions but the COEs will drive them. This structure allows the properties, specifically property leaders, to focus even more on guest service and employee engagement while driving cash flow at the properties.","On Slide 18, we thought it would be helpful to go through a few examples. Let's take food and beverage. Under the old model, labor standards, pricing, menu development, wine list were each set at each individual property. We have moved this to the Food and Beverage COE which allow us to continue to consistently execute these initiatives with a smaller team. In addition, the responsibilities at these properties have changed, so the level management running the division, the pay and the infrastructure needed at the properties will all be reduced.","On the casino side, decisions around machine and table mix, casino floor layout, minimum bets, labor standards have also moved to the COE. And much like food and beverage, the infrastructure needed at these properties has changed. In addition, overall, we believe there are opportunities at both property and corporate as we look at widening our span and control and reducing layers company-wide.","Before I turn it back to Jim, I want to let you know that we've made progress already. MGM 2020 is an extremely complex exercise, as this is not just a cost-cutting program. We are setting up the company to operate in a much more nimble way that will also support us in Phase 2 in the execution of our business transformation led with our digital - through our digital efforts. And with the help of consultants and through the leadership of our COEs, our portfolio presidents and property presidents, we have implemented the first wave of the operating model.","Throughout March, we've had approximately 35 of our senior leadership team take a voluntary retirement package. Before the end of the second quarter, we expect a total of nearly a thousand position reductions some of which were announced just last week. These changes will ensure we hit our targets for this portion of MGM 2020.","In the first quarter, we incurred $52 million in MGM 2020 cost including $41 million of restructuring charges related to our operating model work and other consultant and technology costs as part of Phase 2. Our consultants are experts in business transformation and we have worked with them before with successful outcomes.","While these costs have a short-term impact on our profitability, we believe they are an investment that will pay dividends in the future. These eliminations were identified after a comprehensive process and the impact is being felt across the company. This is a significant change that is meant to be transformative with a goal of minimizing impact on our customer experience and employee engagement.","And with any exercise of this nature, we are cognizant of impact to morale. So we have been very mindful with transparent communication and change management programs to guide our leaders, employees through this time. While change is hard, particularly change that involves headcount reductions, we are confident that this will make us a more efficient, nimble and effective enterprise going forward. This is also vitally important as we turn our attention to Phase 2 of MGM 2020 where we will focus on using new technology to target, attract, and retain new customers to grow our competitive advantage.","Now I will hand it back to Jim.","James Murren","Thanks Corey.","As you've heard, we're committed to our long-term growth strategy and we're fully on track to achieve our stated goals of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion in consolidated adjusted EBITDA by year-end 2020. Remainder of the key drivers remain the ramp-up of the open properties and the program Corey's talking about, MGM 2020.","We're also targeting free cash flow per share, as I said, of $3.50. We have dramatically, as you know, reduced our overall CapEx spend as all our major development projects are behind us. Our properties are all in excellent shape with no deferred CapEx.","We will continue to be focused on fortifying our balance sheet. Earlier this month, we raised a $1 billion in senior notes at a very attractive rate and use the proceeds to address our near-term maturities. We remain confident in our goal to get our consolidated net leverage to 3 times to 4 times by year-end 2020.","We did not buy stock in the quarter as we were focused on our debt issuance, the bond tenders, and funding our previously announced acquisitions. But our capital allocation strategy has not changed. We have a $1.4 billion remaining authorization of our share repurchase and we intend to use it over time.","As always, we're excited about the opportunities in Japan, in sports, and in the digital space. And to that end, we recently hired Atif Rafiq, who will be our President of Commercial and Growth, where he will develop new customer experiences business models and revenue streams. He comes to us from Volvo where he was overseeing the research on the next generation of automobiles and he was previously responsible for the global digital transformation at McDonald's, very experienced digital leader. We're very excited to see the changes he will bring when he arrives mid-May.","On Japan, our Company has had a team there for roughly six years. We continued to deploy exceptional resources to that market and we expect to win and get a great return on all of it. Just recently, I've met with both the Mayor and the Governor of Osaka and was honored to inform them that MGM has adopted an Osaka-first strategy focusing our Company's considerable resources on creating a breathtaking resort that will celebrate the entire Kansai region.","We've been clear from day one that we believe that it is essential to work in collaboration with Japanese companies to develop a uniquely Japanese integrated resort. And we have found a like-minded and natural partner in ORIX.","We're forming a robust consortium that is anchored by but not exclusive to ORIX, who is a leader in consortium building in Japan. ORIX is a leading Osaka-based Japanese company with its roots and a significant asset base in Osaka and Kansai. And it shares with MGM a strong passion to develop a Kansai-focused integrated resort that will deliver a huge boost to the region's economy.","Over the past two decades, MGM has developed and assembled our industry's most successful portfolio of premier real estate in the US. During this time we have executed on strategies to highlight this value and have been focused on unlocking long-term value for our shareholders. And to that end, our Ad hoc Real Estate Committee has made progress in evaluating numerous strategies to maximize the value of our assets, and working with outside advisers, has narrowed their analysis to a small handful of options.","While there's no fixed timetable for their recommendation to the Board, I expect it will take months, not quarters. We're going to let the committee continue to do its work and present its recommendation we're not going to get ahead of them. So I appreciate you limiting your questions on this topic.","And finally, while the industry may be on the cusp of another round of consolidation and change, I want to be clear that our path to creating shareholder value does not depend on M&A. We're undergoing meaningful change ourselves internally with MGM 2020 and we remain committed to our strategy focused on our core operations and maintaining the stability at the top levels of management. We believe that our efforts today will ultimately result in a stronger company with greater competitive positioning in the industry.","Thank you. Now we'll turn it over to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Joe Greff","My first question relates to the Baccarat segment in Las Vegas. How did that gaming patron and your views and outlook there compare presently to the outlook they had on February 13th when you reported fourth quarter results? As you look ahead, are there any signs to be optimistic given what we're seeing in terms of China macro and the prospects of US-China trade resolutions? And then I have a follow-up.","Bill Hornbuckle","Joe, hi, this is Bill Hornbuckle. Good afternoon. Look, I think we're seeing some of the same signs, but I think it's important to keep it relevant. First and foremost, remembering and go back on Jim's comments, '18 was an exceptional year. Our market share as it relates to Las Vegas has not deterred, I mean in fact we're mid 40s and we lead the marketplace here, and it was tied to a handful of customers.","I think as you look at the balance of the year, it's important to understand that as of the first quarter, 30% to 40% of our net baccarat revenues have been had, if you will, given the cycle of how the year works in that marketplace, and if you look at our lineup and things that we have going forward and our ability to continue to attract, they're meaningful.","Of note, Jim mentioned we have - in May we have Canelo, in June we have a Tyson Fury fight, in July we have Manny Pacquiao, and we also have Paul McCartney coming in June, all things that attract the Asian business and things we think and we know can motivate folks coming here.","I think the other thing to keep in broad perspective given our diversification is that the net impact of all of this is mid single digits in terms of our EBITDA. Fundamentally, the business hasn't changed. We think we're in good shape, we're market leading, we think we've got an event calendar that will be meaningful and continue to drive the business.","James Murren","And Joe, this is Jim, just to answer the question, the baccarat trends are exactly what we had thought we would see when we gave you guidance in February.","Joe Greff","And Corey, you gave us a lot of details and information on 2020. You may have said this or you may have said this and I think Catherine you may have said it in a different way, but can you give us maybe as of, I don't know, the end of March or as of now I guess maybe the kind of year-to-date the tally on labor savings where we stand now and then how do you see that cadence in the 2Q in the back half of the year?","Corey Sanders","Yes, Joe, as I mentioned, we're looking to achieve $80 million in fixed labor savings. Most of that will be done by the end of Q2 and you'll start seeing that starting to flow through in Q3 and Q4.","Operator","The next question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","Maybe, Corey, just to stick with the same comments since you gave us so much detail on a 2020 plan, you know, as we get into this, is there - and there is some real big shuffles happening at the management levels, is there any risk of sort of near-term disruption to core operations in your view, anything that might be sort of revenue touching and then on that also we've seen some big systems implementations happen in the past and also create some dislocation out there for some companies that have gone through meaningful transitions. So anything on the systems side that investors should be aware of or could cause any disruption there?","Corey Sanders","So, Shaun, I'll answer the technology stuff and I'll team up with Bill on the operational stuff since we both have a pulse on it, but he's dealing with this real-time every day. On the technology side, we are implementing the ERP in the finance area, we have a very thoughtful plan also through our PMO office that I think will mitigate any type of transformation there.","All the other technology that we're investing in I think will only enhance the customer experience and the employee's ability to service the customer. On the operational side, I'll turn it over to Bill to get his comments.","Bill Hornbuckle","Shaun, look, I'm looking in the room. We have three new Group Presidents here with us. Between their exposure and experience, my own, we were - this weekend was the first weekend we were in this new operating mode. We are all over the business. We all went to numerous properties. We have a great deal of faith than when left alone to operate the business and service our customers at the operating levels, at the property levels, we're going to be in great shape. Obviously, change is not easy.","We're going to be going through a bunch of change dynamics, but again, we've been looking at this thing since late third quarter of last - excuse me, early third quarter of last year and we've thought through a lot of the opportunities that something like this would create and we think we're really well positioned to take care of them.","Shaun Kelley","And just my follow-up would just be on Park and Springfield. Jim, I think in your comments in the prepared remarks, you said that both are ramping well. Can you just give us a little bit more color on those. I mean we now have some hard numbers for both. Are these you know in line with your underwriting or are they going to ramp to your levels by the second half or when do you think will be at run rates that are consistent with what you're expecting to see there for each?","James Murren","Well, I think I would point to maybe National Harbor is a good example or other new properties that we have developed. Park MGM is really a new property. It certainly probably would have been easier to build a new property. But it is a new property today and we're exceptionally proud of the execution of the delivery of the product and the quality of the product.","The financial returns are tracking what we had underwritten as long as they continue to ramp which we expect that they will. Springfield's start off slower than we had predicted, but is still on the trajectory that we had also predicted. So I believe that you're going to see - we expect to see at Springfield a ramp-up along the lines from a trajectory that we saw at National Harbor. But I can turn it over to Bill if you had any more --","Bill Hornbuckle","Maybe a little more color on Springfield to start. Obviously, it's seasonal. Northeast Corridor, particularly spring, will bring more business. It's happened throughout Connecticut and throughout the region, we anticipate that. We're in full leverage mode on entertainment, Sher, A. O. Smith, Steve Martin all come to Springfield in the near future.","And so our opportunity to put programming in there to continue to expand it, we feel pretty good about, and March by far, and even if you look back on January, February, and March, March was our best month by far so far in the young history of the property.","More on Park, it's beginning already to act like a luxury property, our ability to leverage rooms and particularly entertainment and food and beverage, Corey talked about yielding, but the grosses we're seeing with Gaga and Bruno are unheard of in the industry given the scale. And so we're pretty excited by what all that's going to bring us long term.","Operator","The next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead.","Harry Curtis","First in - in Vegas, there are an awful lot of moving parts, the numbers in Vegas and it includes volumes and hold and also the charges that you've been incurring. So when you try and normalize that, how would you describe your business? Is it on an adjusted basis, do you think that the EBITDA is actually in a growth phase in 2019 or is it just going to take another two or three quarters to see that?","James Murren","You want me to start and then turn over to my colleagues. Hi, Harry. I think what we saw when we talked to you on the fourth quarter is what we're seeing right now. We expect that the market will be up this year in Las Vegas and that we expect at MGM Resorts to maintain if not build our share and we can get into some of the macros around that, you get a lot of information from either the LVCVA or airlines et cetera.","And Corey and Bill can speak to that more, but the overall trends on Las Vegas as a market are the same as we saw in February, and 2020 looks really outstanding, which gives us the comfort to build our book, our base of business. Bill mentioned the entertainment side, we are clearly focused on that because we know it drives a lot of business.","So that is a positive trend for '19 and then into 2020 because of the Raiders coming and the other activities that are going to have a major impact on visitation. The fact that our slot in non-bac table business is growing is an important data point.","That's why we highlighted that it generally does speak to the overall health of the market and the fact that we're able to quickly absorb the capacity of the MGM conference center and actually make it profitable for us also speaks to the overall tone of the market. So from a high level, we feel very constructive on Las Vegas in '19 and '20 and then maybe I'll turn it to you Corey --","Corey Sanders","And what I would say here is, you know, as Jim mentioned, the trends that we're seeing other than the baccarat trends are positive and even that the hold impact from this year to prior year was pretty significant. We were held at the higher range last year and this year we're below the midpoint. But when you look at the first half of the year, we did mention that it would be a little bit more challenging and that the back half would be positive. And with our implementation of the 2020 efforts, it even gives us that much more confidence in growing our cash flow in the back half of the year.","Harry Curtis","And then I wanted to ask a question to Grant. Grant, if you would touch on a couple of topics including the - over the last 3 months to 6 months the direction of your market share, the contribution of the Mansion. And then just the mindset of VIP, the VIP junket and premium mass customers, kind of going back to Joe's question, in Macau, are you seeing any green shoots there in their behavior?","Grant Bowie","So let's go for the first one about market share. So we've continued to increase the share. So we've added about 1%, 100 basis points in the quarter and we continue to look forward to what we saw as a more appropriate level for us.","In terms of, if I can now jump to the VIP in the market, I think we need to understand that Macau is maturing into a very defined segments. So the VIP business, which is both in-house and junket, the junket is a little contracted at the moment, they went through a very big growth curve.","It seems very flat and I think, as everyone says, that market looks like it's going to be down for the rest of the year. In terms of the mass business and then some of that in-house VIP business, before we opened the Mansion, we were already starting to see a positive uptick, but since we've launched the Mansion and More, and also what we call Mansion One which is the gaming area, which came on stream actually in fourth quarter, we're seeing some really positive signs and re-emergence of customers that we have not had in the property.","And frankly, we hadn't overly targeted them for Cotai because until we had the Mansion and we had the products and services that we know the demand, it was somewhat inappropriate for us to invite them and very dangerous. So they are coming back in and I can give you a general indication to this week that demand for the Mansion and the property is looking very strong for the Golden Week which starts here tomorrow.","So in terms of our positioning, we're seeing positive indicators, we're seeing new customers, we're seeing existing customers return. In terms of the market, I would - we would see the mass business continuing probably in that upper single digit. I think the rest of the year is going to be challenging for junkets. And I think we also need to put it in context for Macau and for China, there's a lot of issue - a lot of things going on with the 20th anniversary of Macau, there's big celebrations - a big Issue - big meetings and activities going on in China. ","So I'd say that at the junket end, it maybe a little challenging, but I'm very confident very positive and most importantly very positive about our product relative to the balance of the share.","Operator","The next question comes from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Felicia Hendrix","So, Jim, I know you reiterated your outlook for the full year and you gave us some things to think about for the second quarter in the deck, like you say high hold and you're going to have costs, I think it's $11 million in the second quarter. Are you - and then so you gave us that, but I'm wondering, are you facing any headwinds in terms of group business in the second quarter? I think something might have rotated out in June of this year and I know you're not giving particularly guidance, but when you look at Strip consensus EBITDA of almost $450 million in the second quarter and REVPAR of a little more than 2%, is that something you're comfortable with?","Corey Sanders","Yes, I'll answer that Felicia and we're not going to go into the REVPAR, but on the convention business in the second quarter, it's going to be a good quarter for us. We do have a tough comparison because last second quarter - last year second quarter is pretty solid. And in particular, June, we have a little bit of an impact at one of the properties, but we feel confident - comfortable where the rest of the year is and that the following year actually is even in a better place than this year.","James Murren","Yes, June, we had a good convention rotate out. It happens all the time. It happened this June, but overall tone we feel good about and more importantly for the year we haven't seen any change at all year in terms of the fundamentals, they remain very strong.","Felicia Hendrix","And then I think it was today actually Wynn announced that they're no longer going to charge for parking fees. Wondering how you guys are thinking about that?","Bill Hornbuckle","Hi Felicia, this is Bill. Look, we spend a lot of time, energy, money with technology, we think we have the right policy and the right program, their independent decision won't change ours going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Carlo Santarelli","Bill, you mentioned earlier, you talked a little bit about I think you said 30% to 40% of the baccarat revs in the first quarter and if you just look at - if I just look at the data from the Nevada Gaming Commission, on average, if I look at the first quarter as a percentage of the year just volumes it's basically 25% to 26% over the last few years and I understand you guys have had hold benefits last year and a little bit of a hold headwind this year, but is it the expectation that that seasonality this year within the baccarat segment will be pretty similar, as that would imply you know kind of like a 15% to 20% decline Strip wide in bac obviously starting from a tough spot here from the first quarter where a lot of that that seasonality gets built up but you guys see this first quarter being emblematic of the rest of the year to any extent?","Bill Hornbuckle","Look, I don't know that we're going to change our overall guidance for the year for sure. The first query is always the biggest quarter coming off the domestic New Years and Chinese New Year's. Our programming, although exciting, I mean, we've consistently had major events going forward, you know, hoping Pacquiao's fight data somebody we all know and love, could change the dynamic, but short of that, we think it's going to fall in line with the rest of history.","Carlo Santarelli","And then just one more if I could follow-up on that. Of the $35 million you guys called out the year-over-year negative EBITDA headwind from the baccarat shortfalls, how much of that do you think stems from just maybe the higher end being a little bit softer relative to the confluence of New Years, Chinese New Years and the Super Bowl dates being less favorable in '19 relative to '18?","James Murren","You know, Carlo, as usual, that's half a dozen customers give or take. As you mentioned, Super Bowl last year was 12 days apart. This year, it was literally two. So the two events fell on top of each other. So that had a lot to do with it. Obviously, looking forward, we think we can continue to drive the kinds of activity we always have. Our marketing groups are as strong as they've ever been in terms of people and positioning. I think Grant's growth and market share there has always been to our benefit here in Las Vegas.","We've taken our marketing troops and implemented them more fully into like we've done here in Las Vegas into the Macau environment. And so you know we hope to, A, control our own market share which is you know again in the mid 40s and be continue forward progressively.","Operator","The next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Question for Grant. Your mass market hold increased pretty considerably and that mirrors one of your peers when they reported last week. Anything changing fundamentally with mass market hold?","Grant Bowie","No. But other than - other than it seems to be moving up and it's staying there, which is a positive thing which I think recognizes sort of a broadening and maturation of the market. Obviously, when you start bringing new customers and broadening the base, you seem to see the hold move forward and we're seeing that as a sort of almost like a market trend and holds in Cotai in particular in mass do seem to be a little bit higher. So I think that's just a coincidence of the market and I think it's a positive thing that we're seeing as we move forward.","Thomas Allen","And then just on Japan, the RFC for soccer was launched last week. Any updated thoughts on timing and then potential spend there? Thank you.","Bill Hornbuckle","This is Bill again. So obviously, they've issued it. It will be due in late August. They don't give a specific date. It's open for questions, then over the next couple of weeks, it is a full - they call it RFC but the (technical difficulty)","Operator","This is the Operator. Apparently we have a technical difficulty with our speaker's location, one moment please, stay on the line. Once again, please stay connected. We'll reconnect our presenters here in just one moment. Thank you very much.","Thank you. I have reconnected our presenters' location for the call. Thank you very much.","Catherine Park","Hi, everyone. Apologies for that, we're in the middle of a huge thunderstorm here and it looks like we were dropped, but we're back on now.","Bill Hornbuckle","Next question operator.","Operator","Next question will be from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling","I guess just one broader question, then I'll have a more specific question. But turning to sports betting as one of your target opportunities, can you talk about the trends you've seen in New Jersey and I think you even alluded to Mississippi. How should we anticipate your share evolving in these markets and maybe how the initial trajectories in these markets instruct your thoughts on future markets and strategy?","Bill Hornbuckle","This is Bill. So look, overall, we're really excited where we are, the GVC platform is just coming into play. We've now put the stadium which is their primary product in Borgata. We are finalizing and we'll open with permanent retail outlets in time for football in New Jersey and in Mississippi, in both those locations. And we've gotten through some of our earlier challenges around getting our mobile apps up. So I intend that we will gain share. We are obviously in this for the long haul. We have a massive partner with GVC.","Obviously, our networks with all of the leagues have been and will continue to be very productive force in the long run. And then the interesting thing is, if you looked at Beau and Tunica's results, I think EBITDA in Beau is up 17% and Tunica was up 38% and a goodly portion of that was driven solely by people coming in for sporting events and then the general activity cases around that. So we see significant upside not only in retail but ultimately in mobile.","The other affirmative thing is - and look I don't want to jinx this here, but it looks like Mass, Ohio and Michigan are all strong movers for 19 legislation and we like where those bills stand in terms of our ability to exercise on them and get full benefit from them. So overall we're fairly - we're very optimistic. We recognize on mobile in New Jersey even though we got off to a slow start, but I promise you, we will catch steam in a hurry here.","Stephen Grambling","And as an unrelated follow-up, Mandalay Bay revenue looked like it was down year-over-year on what seemed like an easier comparison. How much of that would you attribute to hold versus convention calendar or other factors that we should keep in mind?","James Murren","I can attribute it to the convention calendar. I think we've struggled with a particular group compared to year-over-year, but again, it's cyclical. I think overall Mandalay continues to heal. I'd say you know we're about 90% where we want to be, and we like where we're going, we're pushing forward. And remember, I think the real catalyst for change there is the Raiders.","When that opens next August of 2020, the programming is going to change that whole south end of the Strip. It's literally in our backyard overharvesting end and it's a pedestrian walkway that will be converted Game Day and Event Day. And so we think it'll be substantive for the property.","Operator","Our next question comes from John DeCree with Union Gaming. Please go ahead.","John DeCree","Two quick ones for me maybe to start for Jim or Grant. Jim, I think in your prepared remarks, you've talked about maybe tweaking the offering at Cotai and you mentioned an opportunity to maybe add 50 or 60 suites. Is there a more formal thought process there and given some of the demand dynamics in Macau, I mean how quick could you get rooms online? And is that - is that's something you're thinking about now that the Mansions and some of the VIP products are online?","James Murren","Yes, I think I'll turn it over to Grant on the ground there and I can add to it.","Grant Bowie","I think as many of you know we actually held back setting up the top tier of the south tower and that's what the white box is. We're actually in the planning phases where we're appointing architects. It'll probably take us into the end of next year, it's probably 15-month to 16-month, 18 months, 17 months buildout. The critical point for us was to work out exactly what we wanted.","And as you hear today, we've clearly defined as to the suite product and that's just working through it. And then on the notion of product and tailoring product, whenever you open a new property, we always know that we do our best to get it right, but we always work out if things have changed during the buildout phase. But our focus is to bring in more food and beverage.","And we're working through that process. We're starting work on our another dining space straight after the holiday in the casino space and we're now seeking out and locking down a series of new food and beverage concepts, not large, hopefully smaller. And at the same time, as part of the activation spectacle, we're looking for even pop-up solutions that we can do so simply to animate and develop.","And for someone like yourselves in Union Gaming, very focused on the Macau market, you understand that all the properties are now looking at lots of new initiatives, particularly in the food and beverage space. So that's really our focus over the next few months. Jim, anything you want to add.","James Murren","Yes, I would just add Grant that what you've told me several times and how constructive and bullish we are on the market itself and how we've been frustrated at MGM that we haven't been able to deliver the entire suite of products that people expect of us, particularly in the high end. Now with the Mansion open, the Mansion villas as well as the gaming areas, we feel like it's - now we're finally on our footing that we can really grow some significant share in a very strong market.","So it's important to us in Asia as of course is our efforts in Japan and I think somebody - we've got cut off on Carlos when we were talking about Japan. Can I turn over to you Bill for a second?","Bill Hornbuckle","I don't know if it was Carlos or Tom, but just to reiterate, the RFC has come out. We have sometime in August. They haven't been exactly definitive for when the RFC is done - due in Osaka. It's robust. It is extensive and it feels like an RFP which I think plays to our favor between ourselves and our partner in ORIX.","We've literally spent a half a dozen years on the ground there and we're going to be ready for this thing with a great deal of velocity and programming. But from there, we hope by next spring to be in full-on RFP process with the national government and look forward from there.","Operator","And that question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Thank you for fitting another one in. I know you commented on your M&A strategy or I'm sorry that your growth strategy doesn't depend on M&A and obviously I think you've talked before about how properties with a lot of regional exposure don't make sense, but can you comment on, would a single asset - a single property asset in Vegas makes sense in your portfolio given all the tremendous synergies it seems like it would have especially that what you're doing this year in terms of furthering that. So any comment on that? And then I was just going to as a follow-up also ask about what convention mix you expect in 2019 because you probably have most of it on the books at this point itself. Can you handle all that? Thanks.","James Murren","Sure Robin. So the standard answer is not to comment on M&A, but a couple of thoughts on your question. I think that something is happening in Las Vegas right now, it's very exciting, very good for the home team. There's a tremendous amount of interest in Las Vegas real estate, both non-gaming and gaming real estate and certainly there's a tremendous interest in a luxury property that is being marketed for sale right now.","What that is doing is bringing a lot of attention both in terms of operators and in terms of real estate owners and investors to Las Vegas to look at the Valley and of course we own about half of the Valley and so it's good for us from the standpoint of having some good discussions and it'll be interesting to watch what plays out. There hasn't been a significant transaction in about a decade on the Strip. So we love what we own and operate. We look at things all the time.","However, as I said, you know we are very focused on what we do have. And I think we can execute and we'll over deliver on our 2020 plans and our free cash flow with the team we have in place and the properties we have.","So I would say it's topical. It's valuable. It's actually positive for MGM that there's interest in Las Vegas as a market. But our focus is on executing on these plans because this is within our control. We've done this before with PGP. We're confident that we can do it here. We've got the right team to do it. And if we over deliver on our expectations here, that's the simplest way, the clearest way of increasing shareholder value and we're not going to let anything detract, distract us from that. You had another question, Robin?.","Robin Farley","On the convention mix.","James Murren","Convention, who's going to tackle that.","Corey Sanders","I have in front of me if I did. Robin, we think it just north of 18%.","Robin Farley","And then I imagine you expect that would go up next year just with [ConAg] rotating back in?","Corey Sanders","It arguably it should, yes.","James Murren","And in closing, I just want to thank you all, sorry for that brief drop off with a rare thunderstorm here in Las Vegas we didn't expect, but we're very confident of the Las Vegas market both in terms of this year and moving forward. I hope you can firmly grasp that the baccarat issue is we believe an isolated event, not permanent in nature.","We've been around a long time. We've seen this movie before. We have no change in the outlook. We talked about this in February, here we are in April, and we feel very confident on our full-year outlook and what's going to happen in the second half. We're well under way, a lot of progress has been made on the 2020 plan. A lot of momentum has been developed and we're confident that we're going to hit our targets.","And I can't emphasize enough our long-term strategy and the goals that are unchanged, the 2020 targets, winning in Japan, dominating in sports betting and continue to allocate capital in a disciplined fashion, now that our major development cycle is behind us and our annual CapEx number is highly known to us which would yield significant and growing free cash flow, which we'll use the way we've described.","And with that, I want to thank you all for joining us. And as always, reach out with any questions that you may have.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."]}}
