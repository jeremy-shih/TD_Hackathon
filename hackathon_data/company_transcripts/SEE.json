My name is Mark and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President Investor Relations. Please proceed ma'am.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Please note that we will end the call by 11:00 AM today.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I am proud to report on behalf of all Sealed Air employees that for the third consecutive year we executed on our commitments and delivered financial and operational improvements. We stayed focused on our objectives and our three division and functions performed extremely well. For the full-year 2015, we delivered 3% organic sales growth with favorable price mix in every division and in every region.","Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 230 basis points. Our productivity metric, which is the ratio between our operating expenses to our gross profit, improved from 65% in 2014 to 60% in 2015. And if you look at our operational results excluding FX and the impact of 2015 divestitures, our net sales increased $217 million and our EBITDA increased by $212 million. That is impressive and something to be proud of.","Our free cash flow in 2015 was $595 million, which excluded $184 million in CapEx, which included \u2013 sorry, $184 million in CapEx and $98 million in restructuring. And we returned $802 million to shareholders through share repurchases and still have $884 million remaining under our current authorization.","Our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is well under way and you can see the financial benefits from Get Fit programs over the last few years. Some of our Get Fit successes include a tight control and strategic alignments, pricing discipline, targeted R&D investments, gross margin expansion, productivity improvements, and working capital management, and there is still a lot to be done. In Supply Chain, for example, our Get Fit efforts are changing and simplifying how and where we operate to deliver improvements in cost of goods sold, cash management and service. Over the last 24 months, we have consolidated 9% of our total facilities, with another planned incremental reduction of 5% over the next 12 months to 18 months. We have reduced our total active SKUs by 30% since 2013, and we will continue to optimize SKUs going forward.","In the past two years, we have been able to cut our cash conversion cycle by a third, largely through better management of payables and receivables. We have clear targets and will continue making progress in 2016 and beyond with a more concerted effort on inventory management. Our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement will ensure that we are consistently realizing operational efficiency. This is the power of being and staying focused. And believe me, our Get Fit program has many more good days ahead.","At our Analyst Day back in June 2015, we provided a detailed investment plan for Change the Game. Our early successes validate the long-term potential of these growth opportunities. In Food Care, for example, demand for Darfresh on Tray in Europe has exceeded our expectations, and our rollout in North America is up to a very solid start. Our recently introduced barrier technology, OptiDure, is also seeing similar market acceptance in Europe, and there is already meaningful interest globally.","In Diversey Care, the acquisition of Intellibot has given us first-mover advantage in the robotics flow care equipment market. We are also delivering on our commitment to bringing sustainable solutions to hygiene industry with our 100% biodegradable plant-based SURE solutions and there are more solutions like this under development.","And in Product Care, our automated solutions including B+ and FloWrap are gaining traction and positioning us as our customers' trusted consumable and equipment partner. We will execute in 2016 with the same mindset as in 2015. We will deliver profitable growth and maximize free cash flow by focusing on execution and operational excellence. We will stay disciplined on our value-added selling approach and we will continue investing in next-generation, disruptive technologies.","And before I get into the details of our results, I want to highlight something that I am very passionate about. And that is sustainability being at the service of financial performance. Companies with sustainability at the forefront of what they do every day are long-term financial winners in tomorrow's world. At Sealed Air, sustainability is at the very core of what we do, how we innovate and how we invest. As such, following the COP 21 agreement in mid-December in Paris, we joined the group of companies who clearly wanted to commit. We pledged to disclose both the total financial impact and the environmental benefits of all new product introductions to our customers.","Proving our leadership, we were recognized for the second consecutive year by CDP for our sustainability efforts and have been awarded a position in CDP's climate indices which puts us in the top 10% of global S&P companies. We were listed in CDP's Supplier A lists, and received 100% disclosure score compared to an average of 84% for the other companies reporting.","With that said, let me turn to our fourth quarter and year-end results by region and by division, and then I will pass the call to Carol for more details on our financials, including our outlook for 2016. On slide four, we present our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales of $1.75 billion, were up 2% on an organic basis, which excludes currency and the Food Care divestitures in North America and in Europe.","Let's start with EMEA. We delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter with favorable trend in some of our largest Western European countries and continued growth in Russia and Turkey. These results were achieved despite anemic GDP growth throughout Europe and a slowdown in emerging markets. Our performance in EMEA is a direct result of our pragmatic decision to realign our organizational structure, enabling our divisions to be well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.","In North America, organic sales were relatively flat, with 5% growth in Diversey Care and a slight increase in Food Care, offset by a decline in Product Care. Asia Pacific was also relatively flat compared to last year. We experienced 2% to 3% constant dollar growth in Australia and New Zealand, which was offset by some softness in China and other Asian countries. Australia and New Zealand combined account for approximately 6% of our net sales, and China approximately 3%.","Latin America was hit the hardest with currency devaluation, declining 18% on an as-reported basis and increasing 7% in constant dollars. Constant dollar growth in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil were attributable to increased demand in our Food Care business. These three countries combined account for about 7% of our total net sales.","And as presented on slide five, the trends we experienced for the full year are consistent with the comments I just provided for the fourth quarter. We delivered $7 billion in net sales, an increase of 3% on an organic basis, with growth in every region.","On slide six, we outline our price mix, volume, and sales trends on a constant dollar and organic basis. We had favorable price mix in every region throughout the year, with the exception of North America in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with this performance, given the declines in resin and our formula pricing structure in our Food Care business.","Our results demonstrate the rate of adoption of our advanced portfolio and how our customers are clearly valuing our offering. At Sealed Air, everything we do and everything we bring to market not only meet the highest criteria for sustainability requirements, but is designed with the most advanced technologies to help our customers improve productivity and save cost. That is an attractive value proposition in today's global economy.","Turning to our performance by division, on slide seven, Food Care sales increased 3% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, driven by a combination of favorable price mix and higher volumes. By region, we delivered 2% and 1% organic growth in EMEA and North America, respectively. Latin America was up 12% in constant dollars, and Asia Pacific was slightly up.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% on an organic basis. Margins of 18.7% expanded 120 basis points compared to last year. Throughout 2015, in every quarter, in every region, we delivered positive organic growth and outpaced our end markets. In addition to what I highlighted earlier on Darfresh on Tray and OptiDure, we are seeing increased demand for ready meals and our fluid-based solutions.","We have three effective systems operating in three regions around the world and, heading into year-end, equipment sales were strong. This is a strong indication of the strength underlying our Food Care packaging business. Our hygiene business, our direct in hygiene business, our direct food contact chemical solution, designed to improve food safety and extend shelf life, is really gaining traction with our key customers.","This quarter, our team in Asia Pacific was awarded a Darfresh Vacuum Skin Packaging, or VSP, contract for red meat, poultry, and seafood with a large supermarket chain. This breakthrough solution increases operational efficiency, extends shelf life, reduces food waste, and differentiates this customer from their competition through brand building. This is the first introduction of Darfresh VSP in this region.","Before I highlight our full-year results and 2016 outlook for Food Care, let me briefly provide you with an update on what we're seeing in the North America beef market, which was down approximately 5% in the fourth quarter and also 5% for the full-year 2015.","Industry data points suggest that we are at the bottom in North America, and there is evidence that the market is on track to turn positive in the second half of 2016. Going forward, we're well positioned to continue outperforming the capital market in North America as production increases, and we continue to penetrate existing and new customers with our advanced portfolio across all proteins and adjacent markets.","For the full year, Food Care net sales declined 11% as reported, but increased 4% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.3% expanded 280 basis points. And as on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%; excluding unfavorable currency and divestitures, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% on an organic basis for the full year.","In 2016, we expect Food Care to deliver net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth on an organic basis and margin expansion. We expect volume trends in the second half to be stronger, as we reap the benefits of the beef cycle turning positive in North America.","Slide eight highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant-dollar basis were approximately 3% up in the fourth quarter. We had favorable price mix in every region and volume growth in EMEA, North America, and Asia Pacific. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.2% increased 9% on a constant-dollar basis. So across all regions in Diversey Care, even in Latin America where the volume is the most challenging, we have improved the overall quality of the operations. We are investing in disruptive technologies and have reshaped our product portfolio with a keen focus on sustainability, productivity and the integration of chemicals, tooling and machinery.","We have focused our sales and marketing efforts on our core vertical markets, including hospitality, healthcare, facility management, food services, and retail. This approach is enabling us to grow our core business and consistently win new customers. In fact, we recently had strategic wins in North America in facilities management, as a result of our focus on total cost of ownership and strength in our solutions offerings.","You can see the results of our efforts in the performance of North America and EMEA regions, both of which have delivered constant dollar growth throughout 2015 after years of declining sales. And in the fourth quarter, North America was up 5% and EMEA was up 3% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific, where we have solid footing, continued to have favorable performance and delivered 2.5% constant dollar growth in the fourth quarter.","Our pipeline for our Intellibot machines continues to grow and we have over 200 machines operating today in the field. We are integrating the advanced robotics capabilities of the Intellibot into our leading TASKI floor care equipment. I can assure you that we have learned a lot about robotics from that acquisition.","We also continue to see strong demand in healthcare for our Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide or AHP technology with products like Oxivir.","For the full year, Diversey Care net sales increased 3% in constant dollars, also on an as-reported basis, it declined 8%. This division was hit the hardest by currency devaluations. We continued our commitment to support our core growth and Change the Game initiatives by making substantial targeted investments in sales, marketing and R&D, including the acquisition of Intellibot.","Even with these increased investments, we still delivered 10% adjusted EBITDA growth in constant dollars and margins of 11.6%. And going forward in 2016, we expect favorable sales and EBITDA trends in Diversey Care on a constant-dollar basis and margin expansion. We will continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities and manage our cost structure to help offset currency headwinds.","Let me now turn to Product Care results on slide nine. Product Care net sales declined 3% in constant dollars in the quarter and 1% for the full year. As you know, rationalization efforts have been ongoing over the last 12 months. Our efforts in Latin America for the most parts are behind us and we look forward to rebuilding our business in that region.","In North America, effective in January of this year, we divested another $15 million of a product line. In EMEA, our rationalization efforts are still underway and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. If you look at our Product Care business on a global basis, excluding rationalization, it is performing well ahead of our expectations. Throughout 2015, we experienced double-digit growth in e-Commerce and third-party logistics and significantly improved our profitability in general packaging. We changed leadership in both Asia Pacific and Latin America and are already seeing the benefits of our new go-to-market approach.","It is worth noting that across all of our end markets, including the industrial segment, which has been relatively soft, we had strong equipment placements heading into year-end. This is an indication of future growth and we look forward to capturing that opportunity as the year progresses.","Our adjusted EBITDA performance really tells the 2015 story for Product Care. In the quarter, Product Care delivered margins of 21.5%, a 360 basis points improvement compared to last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 310 basis points to nearly 21%. And on a constant-dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% in the quarter and for the full year. While some of these growth and margin expansion is the result of lower input cost, more of the improvement came from our rationalization efforts, pricing disciplines and an increasing mix of global performance packaging solutions.","In 2016, we expect volume growth to improve throughout the year, as we complete our rationalization efforts and continue increasing our penetration into the rapidly growing fulfillment market. For adjusted EBITDA, we expect continued constant dollar growth and margin expansion.","And now, let me pass the call back to Carol to review our net sales and EBITDA bridges, cash flow, and outlook. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide 10 and 11; let me walk you through out net sales bridge and adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and for the year. Starting with net sales on slide 10, we delivered $1.75 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7 billion for the year. On an organic basis, sales increased approximately 2% in the quarter and 3% for the full year.","Sales growth was attributable to favorable price mix, which was 1.6% or $32 million in the quarter and 2.3% or $176 million for the full year. Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods. Unfavorable currency translation was $190 million in the quarter and $764 million for the full year.","In 2015, approximately 18% of our total sales were exposed to the euro. In the quarter and for the full year, divestitures impacted net sales $64 million and $172 million respectively.","Turning to slide 11, for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $282 million or 16.1% of net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unfavorable currency translation was $30 million, and the impact from divestitures was $11 million.","On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 15%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $40 million, and restructuring savings of $16 million. We are pleased to have delivered 190 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and 180 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year to $1.17 billion or 16.7% of net sales. Unfavorable currency was $126 million and the impact from divestitures was a negative $33 million. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 19%. This increase was primarily due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $185 million, as well as restructuring savings of $60 million.","The increase in SG&A and other expenses of $44 million was primarily related to higher, non-material inflation costs. We delivered a 230 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. For the full year, medical and corporate expenses, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial tables, was a net expense of approximately $69 million as compared to a net expense of $90 million in 2014. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the strong performance in our medical business.","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full-year 2015. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.11 for the quarter and $0.38 for the year. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower adjusted tax rate and share repurchases. The adjusted tax rate for Q4 2015 was 8% as compared with 9% for Q4 2014. For the full-year, our adjusted tax rate was 20% as compared with 22% for 2014, contributing approximately $0.06 to the year-over-year EPS improvement.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded foreign tax credits that previously were considered not recognizable. In 2015, we repurchased 16.1 million shares for a total value of $802 million. For the full-year, the average diluted shares outstanding were 207 million compared to 214 million shares in the same period a year ago.","Our share buyback had a favorable impact of $0.09 on 2015 adjusted EPS, as compared to 2014. We have $884 million remaining on our share repurchase program. We ended the year towards the low end of our target leverage ratio of 3.5 times to 4 times. We believe this leverage range is optimal given our solid and recurring free cash flow.","Turning to slide 12; free cash flow was a source of $595 million in 2015, excluding the tax refund associated with the settlement agreement. Cash interest payments were $224 million and CapEx was $184 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of $50 million in 2015. We have made meaningful progress over the last few years achieving our operating working capital target of 15% of net sales based on a 13-month average. This is a 200 basis point improvement as compared to the same period a year ago. And as Jerome noted, there is still opportunity for us to improve inventory management.","Turning to slide 13; we present our outlook for 2016. We expect net sales to be approximately $6.8 billion, a 3.5% increase on an organic basis. On an as reported basis, unfavorable currency is expected to be $400 million. We anticipate approximately $250 million of this unfavorable currency in the first half of the year. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacts the first quarter. Based on these assumptions, we anticipate net sales in the first quarter to be approximately $1.6 billion.","Adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2016 is expected to be in the range of approximately $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, an increase of 7% to 9% on an organic basis. On an as reported basis, we are estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $65 million. We anticipate nearly $40 million of this unfavorable FX in the first half of the year. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacts the first quarter.","Keep in mind that we will have our toughest year-over-year comparison for Food Care in the first quarter 2016 due to currency headwinds, the impact from the divestitures, and formula pricing. On an organic basis, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be down slightly. We expect sequential improvement for the remainder of the year.","For the full year, we expect Food Care to deliver organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full-year 2016, as we continue to invest in our next-generation technologies, including sensing, data analytics, and our digital platform, and make further progress on our global ERP rollout.","Our adjusted EBITDA in Q1 is estimated to be approximately $245 million. We expect EBITDA to improve sequentially for the remainder of the year. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60. The adjusted EPS unfavorable impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.18. Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2016 is based on an adjusted tax rate of 24%.","Our free cash flow in 2016 is estimated to be $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which is in line with the estimate we provided at our Analyst Day in June. Included in the $275 million is approximately $100 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus, and $40 million is associated with other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $135 million. Cash restructuring payments are expected to be $110 million.","We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million in 2016, and we'll have higher savings in 2017. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. We anticipate working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million.","In closing, we are confident that we are investing in the right markets and in the right regions, where there are growth opportunities for Sealed Air. We are not ignoring the global environment around us, and we will continue to implement continuous improvement processes to ensure we realize further operational efficiencies. Our focus on new product adoption and investment in disruptive technologies will drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years to come.","Before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our first quarter 2016 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 28, at 10 AM. With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Louis Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just first question around Latin America, because I think in the quarter, if I looked at the slides correctly, it was up 10% organically in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about that? Are you seeing anything in the economic environment that makes you concerned that that growth rate is not sustainable?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Latin America has been a difficult continent throughout 2015, especially as devaluations in the second half have increased. Everybody knows the situation in Brazil, and we have dramatically suffered from our positions in Venezuela, but that's what it is. Having said that, we have some very strong bright spots, especially in Argentina, which has been one of the countries where we've been growing the most in local currency and in dollars in 2015. So, in the end, the environment is what it is. We have been slightly impacted in our Food Care business. We have restructured our product business \u2013 Product Care business, so we \u2013 the comparables are not easy to make here, because we have gotten rid of some very low-quality business.","And in Diversey Care, we have had some spotty difficulties, including the countries I have mentioned, especially Venezuela and so. But altogether, we are fairly confident that we have hit the trough in these countries.","In Food Care, we believe that in Latin America, outperformed the market despite the volume declines. There's a very strong interest in our new products introduction in countries like Argentina, Mexico and Brazil for example.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning, and first off, congrats on the strong finish to 2015.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ghansham. Good morning.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. I guess my question relates to the 2016 organic growth rate of 3.5%, which is clearly an acceleration over the second half 2015 run rate, even with the macro presumably more challenging. I guess what gives you more confidence on that type of outlook? And how does that break out between volume and price mix? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, it's interesting, it seems that everybody is rattled about (35:52) the economies. I would say the financial markets are pretty (36:00), one week it's oil, another week it's China, another week it's the banks, et cetera. I am not that negative. We are \u2013 we had growth of \u2013 when apples-to-apples, we had 2.8% growth in 2015. We have an objective of growing 3.5% plus and very frankly, I am very pleased with what I'm seeing with our new products and I could go and take them division-by-division.","So, we have our Food Care business, which is going to be helped in the second half of the year by the massive cattle situation that we have talked in details about during our Investor Day saying that it was probably going to be coming the second half of 2016. And we definitely have now more confidence that it is clearly coming at that time. We have lots of very new products. We talked a lot about Darfresh on Tray. We talked a lot about OptiDure. We are \u2013 we have given you projections, 2018 projections for those type of products during our Investor Day. We are ahead of our schedule. We're very pleased. On Diversey Care, we're making very steady progress, substantial customer wins, very strong value proposition. Our Intellibot business is going well, our TASKI business is going well. Our positioning is very strong. Our Product Care has suffered from top-line growth in 2015. As we said earlier, we've divested from a little business in North America effective January 1. We are likely to conclude something else in Europe, which is not a quality business later in the first half. But our value proposition, the acquisition of B+, the launch of our FloWrap solutions, our new offerings are making me really confident.","So, it's been a long answer. But very frankly, between 2.8% and 3.5%, given what we have is something that we should really be able to do. And this is in an economy which is not good, but when has it been good in the last three years?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, Ghansham, just specific to your question about volume versus price mix. It's more heavily weighted with more than half driven by volume.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please proceed.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Congratulations on the year and thanks for all the details. I had a point of clarification question, and then I wanted to touch on organic volumes for the year. So Carol, I just want to make sure I heard you right. You are forecasting the EBITDA for the quarter coming in \u2013 did I hear correctly, at $245 million, with food being down somewhat? And I guess by implication, the other segments being up? And then just comparatively, what was the prior year if I strip out divestitures and the like?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, George, on the \u2013 the $245 million is correct for the Q1 EBITDA forecast and driven mainly the decline by Food Care. So, yes, the implication is the other two would be up. And then on the divestitures, I guess \u2013 Lori, I'm trying to (40:00).","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","What we had for 2016, what we have is $18 million of \u2013 $18 million to $20 million in currency, and we've got about $18 million in divestitures.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Right. George, in Q1 of last year, it included \u2013 it has a North America and European trade divesture of $67 million. And on the bottom line, that impact is about $14 million in EBITDA. So $67 million on the top line and $14 million on the bottom line for Food Care. He had another question.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, is George still available? I think he had another question.","Operator","George is not available.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. So, if George comes back in the queue, please let him in. Can we go to next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Josephson from KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Carol, just on the FX assumptions, can you help us with what currency rates you are assuming for the full year? And how much different your sales and EBITDA guidance would be if you were taking today's rates as opposed to perhaps year-end rates?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So, with respect to the assumptions we made, euro, we used $1.05. We recognized that's less than where the euro's at today, but there's still a lot of volatility out there. And we feel like that's a good prudent exchange rate for us to utilize with our guidance.","We referenced that about 18% of our revenues were based in euro for 2015, so the math can be calculated there. For the ruble, we used $80.5; the Brazilian real, $4.33; Australian dollar, $1.44; the Great British pound, $1.45; and the Canadian dollar, $1.30.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, can you go to the next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please proceed.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. On free cash flow, getting beyond the CapEx bump in 2016, is that $200 million CapEx guidance for 2017 that you gave at the Analyst Day and I think that was sort of your normalized range beyond 2017. Is that still intact or is there anything \u2013 whether it's divestitures or maybe being a little bit ahead of expectations on Change the Game that would change that kind of $200 million normalized range?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So let me just make a general comment. You have pointed, Anthony, exactly the right thing, which is, are we ahead or are we late compared to our forecast given at Investor Day. And outside of currency, we're ahead, and we stand \u2013 what did we say? We said 4% to 5% organic growth on the top line and we said that it was not going to be linear. And what did we just say? We said 3.5% for 2016 and we confirmed that it's not going to be linear. It's going to be improving over time, thanks to the ramp-up of our solutions which are really getting market traction.","Then we said 7% to 8% growth of EBITDA over time. Over that period 2015 to 2018, with the goal of reaching EBITDA margins of 18% in 2018 and 20% in 2020. You'll remember that I also said that our goal was to align the year with the EBITDA percentage, well, thanks to \u2013 in 2015, we're ahead and we plan to continue to be ahead.","So, all together, we're comfortable with the EBITDA growth guideline that we have given for that \u2013 in July \u2013 or in June of last year for 2015 to 2018. And definitely with the growth targets, we believe that we are ahead. And on your point on capital, Carol can comment. But, yes, indeed we're also confident with the guidance that we have given over the next three years for free cash flow as a result \u2013 including also as a result of the capital where we said that it was going to be $180 million to $200 million, if I remember.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, $180 million to $220 million, so averaging out about $200 million and we still feel like that's the right number given growth, investment opportunities that we're very confident we'll have those investments that will continue to drive Change the Game.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos. Please proceed.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","George?","Operator","George, please try to make sure your phone is not on mute.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. You want to move to the next question, operator, please? Thank you.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes and good morning. Question has to do with the \u2013 just basically the free cash flow guidance. And I just wanted to really zero in on the tax situation. You mentioned, Carol, a tax rate of 24% and I wondered how much of that would be cash taxes in the sense that you might still have some carryover tax benefits from the settlement and maybe some other items. In other words, is that going to be all cash or do you think it'll be some benefits carryover that will reduce the cash tax rate?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, we \u2013 actually what we communicated, Chip, on Analyst Day is that our cash taxes will be going up as we move forward because we have utilized a lot of the benefits. So, our guidance at $125 million will be moving to $180 million is our estimate for 2018. So, we expect that to continue to increase as we go forward.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Gabe Hajde, actually, sitting in for Chris. Wanted to touch on the raw material environment, sort of what your expectations are heading into the year, what's baked into guidance, and if there's any sort of benefit price-cost spread that you are looking at, that's baked into your number?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, are you saying long-term, or you \u2013 could you rephrase the question? Are you referring about the long-term environment, or just basically 2016?","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, Jerome, I mean, the more near-term question would be, what is assumed in your guidance? And given sort of what we're seeing with oil, where it is today, and increased capacity in polyethylene, is your long-term expectation that it could stay down here, in terms of resin, regardless of what happens with oil?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, we have baked in our forecast weak polyethylene prices, olefins prices, and these are already in our forecast. We're very close to those markets and, so far, they are developing as we thought they would be developing. So, we don't believe that there is much upside compared to what we have forecasted at this point in time.","With regards to the overall environment, while we are on February 10, have been, year-to-date, to nine countries around the world. And my job is to have one eye on the microscope and one eye on the telescope. And I can assure you that I'm very close to what's going on. And I went to Asia, I went to Europe, traveled in North America, and I am seeing positive momentum altogether.","So this painting things in black and white globally is \u2013 might be fashionable, but I just don't see it this way. I'm seeing that we have customers, and we have momentum with customers, and we have new customers who are interested in what we're doing, who want to eliminate food waste, who want to eliminate and optimize packaging, et cetera, who want to improve their food safety, who want to see productivity improvements in their operations in the Diversey Care, and they're looking at us as having the ability, the capability, the knowledge, the results, to bring them value-add decisions. And I must say, I'm pretty optimistic.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde from BMA (sic) [BMO] (49:41) Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's BMO, thanks. Good morning, Carol. Good morning, Jerome.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wondered if you could just talk about sort of uses of cash in 2016. The stock is quite a bit cheaper now than your average price last year but, at the same time, probably acquisition multiples on businesses you might be interested in are probably coming down. So, just some thoughts on that.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So Mark, we've stated many times that, with respect to acquisitions, we do not have a huge focus to go out and acquire, something other than what could be considered a bolt-on or an added technology benefit for the company. And in fact, over the three-year planning horizon that we communicated on Analyst Day, we said we were estimating a total of approximately $400 million over that time period. Our acquisitions to-date have continued to be things that bring technology to the company, or expand market penetration capabilities with existing customers, and can help us win new customers. So that \u2013 our focus there won't change. Jerome has been very vocal about, with his experience, a lot of acquisitions just aren't successful and we're going to remain focused where we have core capabilities and we know we can bring successful financial results to our investors.","With respect to looking at share repurchase, we were very active in 2015. We're confident in the price that we paid, that it's a good value over the long term. We work with the board, providing them various financial models around intrinsic value, Monte Carlo simulations based on our long-term forecasts. And while the price is extremely attractive right now, we'll continue to work with the board on what they think are the right actions for us to move forward with the remaining value of our share repurchase program. And we also will manage within that 3.5 times to 4 times leverage.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, let me add a little bit of color in here. We \u2013 my view on acquisition hasn't changed. There is a time for making large acquisitions, and there's a time for staying focused. 2016 is still, for us, the time to remain focused.","We have a lot of value to capture through our ongoing \u2013 in 2016, in 2017 to our Get Fit programs, a lot. And we have a tremendous ramp-up on our innovation and of our Change the Game. Let's separate those two. Change the Game are highly disruptive innovations, they're not all of our innovations.","And we are continuing to do small acquisitions, and those are technology targeted and we are very pleased \u2013 very, very pleased \u2013 with every single of those that we have done, they are very small companies, generally speaking they're start-ups, but we have done that. Are we going to do bigger ones in the years to come? Yeah, we probably will. Having said that, you want to do those when you have basically exhausted the bulk of your opportunity \u2013 organic opportunity \u2013 and we have so many opportunities, on what we are improving and doing, that we should not be distracted.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. The industrial economy is obviously quite weak. It's impressive you expect Product Care volumes to be up this year. Can you kind of parse out the opportunities you are seeing that's driving the growth, whether it's e-commerce or dim weight, and how trends are shaking for just the broader market? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, the industrial \u2013 as you seem to focus here on the Product Care, it is correct that industrial markets, and we have noted that in our packaging sales for industry and on exports for out of the year, we have noted softness. This is correct.","You mentioned e-commerce. We have had double-digit growth. We continue to have double-digit growth and we're focusing a lot on dim-weight and on solutions, which can reduce damage and improve the volume of the boxes, et cetera.","This is why we have acquired B+. This is why we have developed and launched our FloWrap technologies. They're having huge interest. We're working with integrators; we're working with lots of 3PLs and fulfillment companies and we are very excited by the discussions that we're having.","The pipeline is absolutely tremendous. And there's not one company we go to who is not impressed with the way we approach the market because we can help them reduce dim weight or dimension in the packaging, and reduce the damage. And when you look at the cash cost of the packaging operation between the cost of the packaging, the cost of the fulfillment operation, which is fulfillment velocity, which is the manpower to pack, between transportation cost and between damage, out of those four cash costs, the smallest of the cost is the cost of the packaging.","And therefore, you cannot isolate the cost of the packaging from the other three because this is how we can add the most value to our customers and extract, by the way, the most value to ourselves also. And we have a very strong equipment placement story here that we \u2013 which has been ramping up over the whole year of last year, and we are very optimistic that this is a very good time for 2016.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, I think we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company. Please proceed.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. Jerome, I was wondering if you could give us a little (56:29) on the food side and compare what you're expecting in terms of growth rate in North America versus a decline in Australia. Have those kind of met one another and decline in Australia will be lower than the increase in North America?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, there are cycles, and you pointed to that cycle. And yes, the Australian beef cycle, which was growing double-digits in the first half in Food Care, was growing at a lower pace in the fourth quarter.","Having said that, now, we believe that the Food Care North America upside is going to be stronger than the Food Care situation in Brazil. And then once again, you have cattle, but you also have pork, chicken, et cetera, and we are fairly positive for the other parts of the world with regards to pork production and chicken production.","In the U.S., we believe that in the second half, given the fact that you have a lot of cattle which moved to feedlots, instead of all the signs out there that it's going to be a stronger year for protein. So that's on the market side. We have grown in a negative environment. We have grown in the U.S. in a minus 5% capital environment in 2015 and this is by adding solutions, value add solutions to our customers and therefore, we're very optimistic about what's going to happen in the second half of 2016.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, that's all we have time for this morning. Thank you, everyone for joining.

This call is being recorded. Leading the call today, Jerome A. Peribere, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Carol P. Lowe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator Instructions]","And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Thomas, Assistant Treasurer and Interim Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Thomas.","Bill Thomas","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that the statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statement. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors.

These pro forma results are available as supplements on our website.","Please note that we will end our call by noon today with Q&A wrapping up by 11:55 a.m.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. I would like you to note that for personal reasons I had to travel to France, and this was not planned. So therefore, I am taking this call from France and Carol is in Riverfront, New Jersey with her team. So we ask for your patience as we address your questions during the Q&A section of our call.","I would also like to note that Bill Hickey, Sealed Air's Chief Executive Officer for the past 13 years, will be retiring effective March 1. And on behalf of all the employees of Sealed Air, I would like to personally thank Bill for his 33 years of service at Sealed Air.","Getting started now, and on Slide 2 of our presentation. Today marks the first time that we publicly report on our new business segment structure. This change corresponds to how we are managing the business and is an important next step in the direct -- in the Diversey integration. We have filed an 8-K, which will provide you with information on which businesses have been combined to form our new reporting segment.","Our Food & Beverage division represents about 49% of our total sales; Institutional & Laundry, 28%; and Protective Packaging, 21%. Additionally, our regions are grouped to correspond with how we view the regions internally. Our regions are: North America, which are 39% of our sales; Europe, 33%; Latin America, 11%; AMAT, Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, 10%, which is, as I just said, composing of these regions; and finally, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, which accounts for 7% of our sales. We finished 2012 with $7.65 billion in revenue, with developing regions comprising 24% of our net sales.","And moving on to Slide 3 of our presentation. I am pleased to report that our adjusted EBITDA was up 17% for the quarter versus the prior year. All of our divisions have had year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA and margin. This improvement was achieved in the face of continuing challenges in Europe and particularly in Southern Europe. Sales in Europe were down 4% and down almost 1% on a constant dollar basis for the quarter. France was down 13%, and in fact, 5% excluding -- are related to foreign exchange and Germany declined 3%, but this was all on unfavorable currency.","Let me also give you some flavor in the challenges in Southern Europe: Italy was down 7%, 6% FX related; Spain was down 11%, 5% FX related; Portugal declined 21%, 5% FX related; Greece declined 11%, 5% is currency. And we also noticed higher levels of de-stocking at many of our North America customers during the latter half of the quarter. Fortunately, that trend has not continued and sales in January support our de-stocking observation. Tight put-in supplies in North America also continue to pose a challenge, and these challenges are partially offset by continuing growth in developing markets, specifically Latin America, where we achieved 13% constant dollar sales growth and AMAT with a 9% constant dollar sales growth. And more importantly than just growth, these regions are giving us profitable growth. We completed the sale of Diversey Japan in November and used the net proceeds of $313 million to accelerate progress toward net debt reduction. For the quarter, we reduced net debt by over $480 million.","Our Slide 4 summarizes our year-over-year and sequential performance versus the third quarter of 2012. We continue to achieve positive momentum across a number of key metrics. We are making progress in achieving net sales growth with geographic expansion, developing new and expanded customer relationship and demonstrating the strength of our sustainability, value proposition to customers, which I will talk a little more about shortly. We continue to recognize strong cost synergy. For the quarter, we benefited from $35 million in cost synergies and full year cost synergies totaled over $100 million. These synergies resulted from a mix of headcount reduction, elimination of redundant costs, plant consolidations and procurement and logistics savings. Additionally, we have initiated a range of initiative affecting our pricing structure and policies across all our divisions, and these initiatives will gain momentum as we go forward in 2013. Although demand increased in Q4 versus Q3, adjusted EBITDA and margin declined sequentially. We incurred approximately $10 million in SAR expense in Q4. We also incurred greater advertising and promotion expenses that are seasonally higher in Q4 and also expenses in Europe tend to be lower in the third quarter as this is a heavy vacation season.","Let's move now to Slide 5. This slide reflects our regions, which cover our 62-country footprint, which continues to give us leading reach and greater opportunity for internal growth than our peers, and we sell into 175 countries. We had very strong growth in Latin America and AMAT, which helped offset some weaknesses in Europe and Japan, Australia and New Zealand.","Turning to Slide 6. Food & Beverage sales increased 2.4% on a constant dollar basis, with 5.6% organic growth in hygiene solutions and 1.7% in Food Packaging and Food Solutions. Regionally, we have double-digit growth in AMAT and Latin America, where our established footprint and strong market presence in Brazil allowed us to benefit from the rising beef production rate in that country. And while supplies -- protein supplies in North America have negatively impacted our year-over-year performance, we continue to outperform the industry growth rate. For the fourth quarter, our North America fresh red meat packaging product increased sales by approximately 2% compared with an almost 5% decline in beef supply in North America. The gain was partially offset by a 0.7% lower price mix due to pricing pressures in Europe and the impact of contract pricing in North America, causing us some -- to lag some raw materials cost increases in our pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 10.4% and reached a margin of 15.6%, compared with 14.3% in Q4 2011. And the adjusted EBITDA margin benefited from higher volume, cost synergies, expense control and a multi-year network optimization program for legacy Sealed Air.","I would like to comment on some of our new product sales for the F&B division during the past year. In 2012, we commercialized over a dozen products that drove new sales across multiple regions. Many of our innovations were driven by customer and consumer demand for greater convenience features on packaging, such as our Grip & Tear feature on bags, easy open\/reclose on rollstock, including our new FoldLOK pouch system and ovenable materials. Among the products we are most excited about are the Grip & Tear bags. This barrier bag is designed to provide a convenient feature for opening a vacuum package. This product is typically used for the -- for in-the-bag merchandising of products that benefits from extended shelf life. And in most cases, the easy opening feature is accompanied by printed instruction for promotional cooking of the product.","One of the biggest drivers for our Food & Beverage business is the global demand for food safety and security. For example, we eat more meals outside the home and more food and ingredients come from all over the world. Our Freshness Plus films combined with our Vertical Pouch Packaging program not only keep food safe as it travels longer distance, it extends shelf life and maintains the integrity of the ingredient. Our Vertical Pouch Packaging program has expanded by near double-digit rate.","When you combine programs such as these with the sustainability hygiene solutions of Diversey such as clean in place and PET bottle track cleaning, we bring a very compelling value proposition to our customers, providing safety, operational efficiency, shelf life extension and product brand protection.","On to Slide 7. The I&L division has the largest exposure to Europe of any of our divisions, with almost half of the I&L sales coming from that part of the world. Obviously, the economic situation in Europe, particularly Southern Europe, is offsetting the good news that we had in other parts of the world. Consumer brand sales have declined 31% for the quarter, with Southern Europe declining 21%. Machine sales in Europe declined 4.3%, but 17.1% in Southern Europe. Overall, net sales increased 2.4% on a constant dollar basis, with 0.7% higher volume and 1.6% higher price mix, but were flat on a reported basis due to unfavorable currency translation. Volume growth was more significant in Latin America, with new customers in Brazil and Mexico and AMAT, particularly in China and India. North America had a very strong Q4 '11 due to a major consumer brand push, making for a difficult year overall comparison. Even so, North America had some new business in the health care sector, business that we won from some of our larger competitors. On that note, I'm very happy today to announce that we have an agreement in principle, with one of the largest global hospitality chain with a few thousand hotels to be their nominated hygiene solutions supplier globally. The majority of the hotel rooms for this new customer are in the U.S. And this agreement demonstrates our commitment to the growing global hospitality industry and exemplifies our agility to meet our customer needs no matter where they are in the world. Most importantly, I believe it demonstrates the strength of our sustainability value proposition, providing solutions that among other things, deliver consumers higher operational efficiency and reduce waste. This is clearly just one of many examples of the potential we have in this company and shows how sustainability can be a great competitive advantage when you can demonstrate cost and performance on top of sustainability.","And finally, let's talk about the Protective Packaging division on the Slide 8. Sales increased 1.5% on a constant dollar basis with higher volume, partially offset by lower price mix and unfavorable currency translation. Volume growth was 4.8% in Latin America and expanded market presence and strength in e-commerce application, which showed solid performance during the holiday shopping season, resulting in 4.4% growth in North America. Our packaging system products like Fill-Air inflatable void fill and inflatable bubble cushioning and mailer solutions are ideally suited for faster growing e-commerce and third party logistics application. We also have new products such as Opti shrink film, a micro layer technology enabling higher performance films. This product results in lower total cost for our customer and an improved environmental footprint. We experienced volume challenges, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, were largely due to the impact of a stronger Australian dollar on exports out of that region, as well as lower demand out of China. Competitive pricing pressures also negatively impacted the performance of Protective Packaging in Q4 as many of our competitors did not move to recover raw material cost increase. We are taking action to recover our material cost increases and all of the Sealed Air businesses understand that I consider it unacceptable not to cover these cost increases.","And now, I will turn the call over to Carol Lowe, our CFO, to discuss fourth quarter financial results in more detail and highlight our outlook for 2013. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. Before we review the remaining slides in our earnings call presentation, I would like to note that we will make available a quarterly summary for 2012 of net sales and adjusted EBITDA by our new segment structure. This information will be made available by the end of this week on our website.","If you are following along with our presentation, Slide 9 summarizes our consolidated adjusted EBITDA performance. Q4 year-over-year constant dollar adjusted EBITDA improved 17% on $51 million in volume increases, which contributed $17 million to adjusted EBITDA and $35 million in cost synergies as previously highlighted by Jerome. These year-over-year favorable impacts were partially offset by a negative price cost spread of $11 million, higher operating expenses and additional resource investment in high-growth developing regions. While we achieved volume growth and favorable currency impact in Q4 as compared with the third quarter 2012, our adjusted EBITDA and related margin declined modestly on a sequential basis. Jerome noted the $10 million in additional SARs expense in Q4, resulting from the increase in our company stock price during the quarter. The additional sales and marketing expenses were also approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. I would like to note that $10 million increase from Q3 to Q4. I'd also like to note that Q4 and our full year benefited from a reduction in our core effective tax rate. Full year 2012 adjusted earnings per share benefited by approximately $0.04. The core tax rate was reduced by some year end transactions, which will also lower our core effective tax rate in the current year.","Turning to Slide 10. You will note that Q4 continues to be a strong cash flow quarter. Adjusted free cash flow from continuing operations was $266 million for the quarter and $405 million for the full year. Full year 2011 adjusted free cash flow was $318 million. A reduction in net working capital was the primary source of cash for the quarter, with inventory reductions accounting for approximately $125 million, partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable. Working capital improvement resulted from targeted programs to reduce inventory and normal seasonal patterns in receivables. Accounts payable balances declined during the quarter in concert with our inventory reduction. Working capital was a use of cash for the full year, with a modest increase in receivables and a decrease in accounts payable more than offsetting the $41 million decline in inventory.","Foreign-exchange translation had a $14 million unfavorable effect on full year 2012 performance. We have programs in place to achieve working capital improvements in the current year as part of our focus on improving cash flow. Capital expenditures of $124 million in 2012 were roughly equal to those in 2011. With capital investments representing 2% or less of sales in both years. Our capital expenditures have been less than our depreciation expense of $170 million in 2012 and $147 million in 2011. I will speak to our need for slightly higher investment in 2013 when we cover our outlook.","Moving on to Slide 11. Cash and cash equivalents were $680 million at the end of the year, an increase of $140 million from September 30. As of December 31, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.5 billion, and our net debt was $4.8 billion. Net proceeds from the sale of Diversey Japan of $313 million were used along with the cash flow from operations to reduce our net debt in Q4 by $483 million. As you think about 2013, please remember that we tend to use cash during the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half of the year. In the fourth quarter, we refinanced a portion of our term loan, resulting in annualized cash interest savings of $6 million. We also refinanced our 5 5\/8% senior notes, which were scheduled to mature this July, with $425 million of 6.5% senior notes that mature in 2020. Thus reducing our near-term funding requirement, and it's moving our debt maturity schedule. We have included our new debt maturity ladder as an appendix to the presentation. We will continue to look to the market to opportunistically extend our maturities and\/or reduce our interest rate. We continue to plan to use our excess cash flow to pay our dividend, reduce debt and prudently invest in the business.","Slide 13 highlights our outlook for the current year. While our top line growth outlook is tempered by flat to negative GDP growth projection for Europe and low single-digit growth estimates for the United States, we are estimating 2013 net sales in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion, which compares with the $7.65 billion net sales for 2012. Our focus on quality of earnings improvement is estimated to realize adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is estimated in the range of $1.10 to $1.20.","We continue to estimate the total restructuring program benefit will be between $195 million and $200 million through 2014, an incremental benefit of approximately $90 million in 2013 compared with 2012. I would like to remind you that we have a heavy employee base and part of this $90 million in savings over 2012 from the restructuring program will be used to fund inflationary cost for that employee base of approximately $50 million to $60 million. Our free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, is estimated at approximately $300 million to $350 million in 2013. This estimate is net of approximately $70 million in restructuring payment. You should compare the $300 million and $350 million with free cash flow of $280 million in 2012.","The $405 million of adjusted free cash flow presented on Slide 10 excluded approximately $80 million of restructuring charges and other balance sheet changes of approximately $40 million. 2013 estimated free cash flow will also be impacted by higher capital expenditures as compared with 2012. As I previously noted, our capital investments have been 2% or less of sales for several years, and our spend has been less than depreciation expense. In 2013, we estimate capital spending of approximately $160 million, which will include investments for targeted strategic growth, as well as cost-reduction projects. Our capital spending will also include approximately $20 million related to the rollout of our ERP system to certain legacy Diversey operation. This rollout will be a multi-year project, with completion estimated for 2015. Our interest payments are estimated at $320 million, and our core effective tax rate is estimated at 26% for the current year.","I would like to also briefly comment on the potential impact of the recent devaluation in Venezuela. We estimate the 32% devaluation announced by the Venezuelan government on February 8 will result in a loss of approximately $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter, and that is a pretax loss. And that's mostly due to trapped cash balances that are held in local currency. The outlook I just described does not include this potential loss as it would be an add back as a not normal operations in the way we present adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. We would like -- we, like other companies with business in Venezuela, have been challenged in ways to minimize our exposure to the fluctuations in that economy, particularly with cash balances. We could have operational losses related to the currency devaluation, but that impact is unknown at this time. Our total annual sales in Venezuela are less than $50 million and that was prior to the currency devaluation. I'd also want to highlight though that they are profitable sales with a double-digit margin.","Before turning the call back to Jerome to lead the Q&A, I would like to note that we have included in the appendix of the presentation a summary of our 2012 adjusted earnings per share calculation for your reference to assist in how we go from our adjusted EBITDA to our adjusted earnings per share number.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Jerome. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Carol. Operator, I would like to open the call up to any questions from the participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from the Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, first question I had, you mentioned in the press release, you're going to be aggressively managing the cost structure and also paraphrasing here, you're going to be even more decisive in taking action on pricing. Directionally, we know what you mean by that, but could you give us perhaps a bit more color where you need to do the most work on both areas relative to your various segments and then I have a follow-on.","Jerome A. Peribere","So 2 questions. The first one is on the cost. The second one on the pricing. With regards to the cost, we are not done with our cost synergies, and you have noted or in the document it is written that we have approximately another $90 million of cost synergies to grow, so that's one. The second on -- and continuing on this, you know Europe is going to have around 0 GDP growth in 2013. I don't know what you think 2014 is going to be, but I think it's going to be many years before Europe comes back and enjoys a 2% GDP growth. As a result of that, and given our employee base in our structure, we need to make sure that we remain cost competitive, which means that we will need to make sure that our cost don't overinflate compared to the size of our growth potential, which by definition is going to be limited. So with regards to pricing, my observation is that we -- still there has not been a price champion and has not necessarily been paid for its IQ and if you allow me a second here, we are not a bag, a food protein bag seller. We are not only a protective packaging product seller. We have a lot of IQ. Our people design plan with our customers. They apply Lean Sigma technology to help shape the plant, the equipment and finally commercialize products because we produce equipment also. We're not rewarded for this. So that's one side of our pricing, which I think that we need to understand better. And the reason why I say that is that either  the customer values those kind of IQ, and we need to be paid for it, or they don't. In that case, we need to stop serving them with this kind of service. And then next to that you have the inflation or the volatility of raw material. And here I come from an industry where -- and that I know pretty well, which was more basic integrated and where the ethylene prices and the propylene prices at the beginning of the year 2000, they were slowly moving up and down. That's not the case anymore. Now raw materials, ethylene, ethane, propylene, propane, et cetera, benzene, et cetera, they move very quickly. We can't leave the price protection that we were having. We need to be very diligent in passing those because we just simply don't have the margin to absorb them for a period of time. So my motto in Sealed Air is, the leader leads, we need to be prepared to lead in pricing when we lead in the market.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My follow-on would be, do you feel you have enough intelligence at this juncture in terms of your competitive positioning, the value add that your products are bringing to your various customers and their verticals to go at pricing and not disadvantage your business, not lose market share that you ultimately wouldn't want to lose? Ultimately, there'll be some mistakes in the process, but how do you feel about your intelligence at this juncture?","Jerome A. Peribere","I will conclude by saying that there are tools. There are -- there is technology to assess pricing and by definition nobody wants to make a stupid mistakes, but things are -- we want to be prudent, but again, if the leader doesn't lead then there are issues, and I believe that -- it's called isoprofit curve, and those are models that we need to work on, et cetera, but I don't think it needs to be necessarily a confrontation. We are entitled to get reinvestment to have reinvestment economics. This is no more. And everybody wants strong supplier. And in some segments, we don't have reinvestment economics, and we need to be better at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you give us some parameters on this new operating structure, operating segment structure you have per unit on how we should think about volumes as we look at '13 versus '12? And I guess, there's a lot of -- you touched on the protein supply, for example, in the food side, but there's also a meat contamination scare in Europe. I wonder if that's also factoring into your outlook there.","Jerome A. Peribere","Why don't you start, Carol, and I'll talk about Europe meat contamination.","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. So Ghansham, if you're asking about a breakdown by region for 2013, we're not providing that specificity. What we will say is that, for the European region, we expect, as Jerome commented, kind of flat growth. The economy there will be flat to negative as been published for North America and specifically with the United States, less than 2% growth there. We think we'll slightly outperform what the GDP growth will be for North America. We are projecting that we will have nice growth within the developing region, within the Latin America countries, specifically with Brazil, and then with what we classify as AMAT, which is Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, that we will have solid growth rates there. Typically, within the developing regions, we'll see high single-digit to lower double-digit, we -- so those would be our expectations. Does that answer, address your question?","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, and then the contamination issue, Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","So the contamination, you can imagine that we are following this from very close. We are constantly talking with our leading customers. And at this minute, it looks like the most affected food segment is the prepared food. Luckily enough, we are small in the prepared food packaging segment. So we are not that worried about an immediate impact. There is some potential speculation that there might be an increase in the fresh meat and in the freshly packed meat in supermarkets. But we're not anticipating this at this point in time, but I hope this gives you some help.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, and just a follow-up, kind of piggybacking on George's question, so if you kind of think about the EBITDA bridge '13 versus '12, you gave us some parameters, right, volume, synergies. If you look at price cost specifically, do you expect that to be positive, neutral or negative for 2013 versus '12?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well our objective is to recoup at least our cost increases.","Operator","Next question comes from line of Phil Gresh of JPM.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question is just, as we think about the resegmentation of the businesses, and I look at the EBITDA margins of Institutional & Laundry versus Food & Beverage and Protective Packaging, and George was kind of asking about the cost versus the pricing elements, I'm just kind of wondering how you feel about what levers you have available within that business to improve your margins. Do you feel like pricing needs to be a big element of that or do you feel like it's cost savings or is it a business that's structurally going to be lower than these other businesses, just some color on how you're thinking about it?","Jerome A. Peribere","So I&L. I&L is having clearly unacceptable EBITDA margins at this point in time. And therefore, we are working on several fronts. Number one, we're working on our cost structure. Specifically, in the geographies where we're most exposed, which is the European region. And as a result of that and given the cost of delayering in Europe, you know that this is something that we are taking, that we are making, but we're making it carefully. Second, we are accentuated our growth in emerging countries. We are very satisfied with the progress that we're making in Asia, Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe. With our growth in I&L, including also in Latin America. We're doing very well. We have double-digit growth in most of the places where we are operating. And most of the time, we are gaining market share. And this is where you're going to see us continuing to make this proportional investment. And finally, no I do not expect to be aggressive on price because I don't think pricing is the solution. I think that we are going to be making a lot of progress as soon as we can convince our customers that we have critical mass and that we are a credible alternative to what their current solution is. And when we have them, that we can continue offering them improved better solutions than the ones we are currently offering them. This is therefore going to convince them that we have critical mass everywhere and that we have improved and better sustainable technology because we do have compared to our -- their alternative, we believe better and improved sustainability solution. And as a result of that, we expect that we are going to be growing. So it's not cost, cost, cost reduction. It is specifically more of that in the places where we believe we unfortunately cannot count on growth to help us. It is this proportional investment where we believe that we have the competitive advantage and where there is growth, and it is also sustainability, which we count as being our enhanced value proposition.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My follow-up question is just on the red meat side. There's significant outperformance there in the fourth quarter. And is that something you see as sustainable in 2013 and what would you say are the key drivers of why Sealed Air is doing so well in this area?","Jerome A. Peribere","So a mix of several things. Number one, we're coming back -- you have negatively reacted to our second quarter, and this might have been an overreaction. We believe that our product stewardship, our innovation and those kind of things are enabling us to more of the kind of margins that your have seen in the third and in the fourth quarter than the ones that you have in the second. That's one. So back to normal, I would say. Second, we have introduced new products, which have a lot of traction. Third, we are not only red meat dependent in our Food Packaging business, but we are also have providing Vertical Pouches, which are very good solutions for our customers. Third, we have in our Food & Beverage division that you see now, we have nicely grown in hygiene solution, which is an important business, of which we are actually working strongly in improving its quality, and we're making good inroads in several parts of the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","As part of your discussion around being able to push for price because you do offer a total solution to your customers, one of the things that you've been known for, for quite some time is your spend on R&D. I think about 2 percentage points, 2% of sales going towards R&D, do you think that's a sustainable level going forward? Do you need to spend that much in order to create these products and maybe you could kind of talk about that in the future where we could see that level of R&D spend go?","Jerome A. Peribere","We will tell you much more about this when we have our Investor Day. We haven't picked the date, but it is going to be end of second quarter or some time in the third quarter. So you will have a full exposure to this. Now, level of R&D is -- we're not going to give justice to it right now in a few -- in a minute or so. My view is that innovation, successful innovation makes -- ensures your future in order to decommoditize. My view of a specialty product is that it is simply a product on its way to commoditization, which means that you need to renew your portfolio with successful innovation. We do have some amazing, amazing innovation in Sealed Air, which we are introducing, which we're pushing, and I could name several, but I'm not going to start that journey because of lack of time. We're spending about $140 million in R&D in Sealed Air this year. Is it too little? Is it too much? I haven't decided. What I want to first measure is the productivity of our R&D. And it's not necessarily a question of dollars, it's a question of quality. I want to make sure that in every single segment, which means in every single of our division, we have best-in-class R&D, which allows us to bring the solutions that our customers need. And they are in product or they are in systems, and they are here in order to surprise our customers with those, which makes them win. So we have to add value, and I am constantly hammering on this trilogy, which is the three-legged stool of sustainability, cost competitiveness and performance. And the new innovation is a great innovation if it answers those 3 questions favorably. So stay tuned and we'll talk more about that.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I look forward to the Analyst Day. The other question is around the growth investments, I think mostly in Institutional & Laundry, you added a number of salespeople in 2012, can you talk about how much you spend on new sales, on those growth investments in 2012 and how much we should expect you to spend in 2013 and then maybe when we should see the benefits?","Jerome A. Peribere","I don't have exact numbers, and as I'm going to make some comments, maybe Carol can add that, but yes, we are adding some salespeople in some parts of the world because we do believe that we have critical mass and a competitive advantage. We are adding some in the U.S. because of the contract that I just announced, and we are going to execute flawlessly. And as a result of that, we are going to be able to again, to price positively our customers in I&L on this specific contract. But we are also adding in some parts, some other parts of the world where we are seeing growth, and as I said, we are expecting double-digit growth in some, in most of the emerging countries.","Carol P. Lowe","So as a follow-on to that, Jerome, the EBITDA bridge that we included in the earnings slide deck, the $22 million negative as you do the EBITDA bridge for SG&A, that includes a little less than $10 million in additional resource investment and most of those resource investment have been made within developing regions, and primarily within AMAT. We have also for the I&L business added some number of resources to support growth within North America for specific market factors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When we look at your EBITDA and sales guidance for 2013 versus your results in 2012, the midpoint of your outlook appears to assume very little margin improvement and given the pricing actions you're taking and some of the cost reduction, is this potentially conservative? And then looking at I&L specifically, given your view that margins there are unacceptable, but understanding restructuring can take time, should we think about margin improvement in I&L as more of a 2014 event or can you talk about the potential to improve I&L margins in 2013?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well you have noted that we have changed our President of I&L. She is assessing the whole situation and already starting to take some decisions. So this is a business which has been suffering from probably too many changes in ownership over the past few years. So step one is to stabilize, step two is to turn it around. I am optimistic, but I'm not going to go and say that it's going to happen in 6 months. I think your 2014 is a good timing, Anthony. Generally speaking, I would say that the reason why I want to take some very firm positions on pricing is that I have observed that over time, Sealed Air has lost EBITDA, including through lack of pricing momentum. My view is that, we need to be firm on this because we are adding a lot of value to our customers, including from the aspects that I talked about earlier, helping in some engineering, selling the best-in-class equipment, including in vacuum chambers and vacuum equipment, et cetera, best-in-class. We have huge market shares on those, and we are potentially not valuing all of these properly. At the very same time -- and you'll understand that those kind of things are some kind of cultural changes that take also a little bit of time. The reason why I'm so emphatic on pricing at this minute is that some of our colleagues in the polyethylene industry and polypropylene industry and polystyrene industry have been jacking prices in a quite substantial way in January and wanted to do the same in February. And this can -- these are big increases that we need to pass on. And before getting margin expansion, you need to prevent having margin contraction. And this is why I'm saying that this is very important.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a quick question for Carol. Carol, you referenced the ERP spend $20 million in '13, and that the project ends in 2015. Do those ERP costs ramp down through 2015 or how should we think about CapEx potentially in 2014, 2015 from an ERP perspective?","Carol P. Lowe","So they would be about consistent to potentially slightly larger in 2014 with not as much spend in 2015 because we will be wrapping up the implementation at that time. We are also benefiting from the fact that we have a significantly trained, well-trained workforce internally that implemented this ERP in prior years across Sealed Air, so we're able to leverage our internal IS team as opposed to having to rely a lot on external resources for the implementation. So we feel like we'll be able to tightly control the spend for the total implementation of the project.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In terms of the EBITDA bridge from '12 to '13, of the improvement you're assuming, can you give some sense of how much is coming from FX, how much is coming from synergies and volume growth and what some of the offsets are to the $25 million-ish of improvement that you're guiding to?","Carol P. Lowe","Well, I guess, Adam, we had commented that we will have about $90 million in synergies, and I also noted that based on our current workforce size, that we spend about $50 million to $60 million on an inflationary basis representing compensation increases as well as benefit cost increases. So that's utilizing a good bit of those synergy savings. We haven't really commented specifically about volume, let's say, low to mid -- low single-digits. If you want to think about it in total, I previously gave comments on one of the questions how we were looking at it relative to each of the regions. So from a currency perspective, what we have estimated or what we used, if you want to use the euro as a proxy, we're using 1.27 euro\/U.S. dollar comparison as the rate. And then for the full year, we -- I'll check my notes to see where we ended up. I know for Q4, we were slightly, I think we were about $1.29 before we would have ended the year, and that was about the average a little bit less from that for Q4, so you could use that just to -- as an estimate from a currency impact.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. Just one follow-on. You have the $90 million of incremental synergies, partly offset by the higher labor, are there -- is there anything that would enable you to offset that labor inflation in subsequent years post the synergies?","Carol P. Lowe","Well, I think, as Jerome commented, that we do have a focus on Lean Six Sigma, continuous improvement. So we'll always be looking at cost structure, and I think -- and he also provided color specific to the I&L business. So there, we will always look that a way to make sure we're covering our inflationary cost as best we can.","Jerome A. Peribere","The answer here is that we have to. We are a manpower-intensive company. 25 -- over 25,000 employees with $8 billion of sales. This is very clearly a manpower-intensive company. Some are in manufacturing and supply-chain, and that line is just normal to produce what we produce. The others are in the service business. And when you have, when you're in the service business, you need to get paid for the service. And therefore, it is very key that through expanded margin, we get paid for the improvement of productivity that we need to get.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Your volumes in protective was actually noticeably stronger than the last 2 quarters, I know Q4 is a big e-commerce quarter, so was that most of the strength coming from and when you look out to Q -- 2013, do you see some of that flowing through?","Jerome A. Peribere","There is a seasonality in this business. We are making good inroads in our e-commerce business. And we also have been launching some new shrink films, which are absolutely revolutionary. They are -- have higher clarity. They have lower gauge and extremely performing decent. They have great value proposition for our customers, and we are having good initial success out of those.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like there's some momentum heading into 2013. And then, I guess, a follow-up, on the free cash flow guidance for 2013, the $300 million to $350 million, if I heard you correctly, Carol, there's about $80 million in restructuring cash cost, so when we look out to 2014, should we expect most of that fading and how should we be thinking about CapEx?","Carol P. Lowe","Yes, there won't be much in the way of restructuring charges under the current program that you'll see in 2014. It would be less than $20 million and probably even less than may -- maybe potentially less than $15 million. It's largely depending on timing of severance since a lot of the synergy cost savings are related to resource reduction. From a CapEx standpoint, as I noted for 2013, we're estimating $160 million in spend. For 2014, provided we perform in 2013 and are able to continue to reduce our debt, we would expect to not have any less than that investment. And hope that we'll be able to have the improvement in the profit of the business to provide not only cash for that restructuring, but also investments. And also just to clarify the $80 million that you referenced, the 2013 restructuring payments are actually $70 million.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So is that a good way to think about normalized free cash flow going forward when you account for less restructuring cost and CapEx for 2014 and forward?","Carol P. Lowe","So what we're doing is, we want to make it more simple for everyone to understand the free cash flow and be able to look at the GAAP financial statement. The cash flow from operations and deduct CapEx. That is a standard definition of free cash flow, and what we will do is call out the unusual items that we are spending cash on, such as restructuring charges. We think that will make it easier. We've had some confusion with some of the nonstandard operating add backs that we do, and we think this will provide better clarity. So yes, you can just follow from the GAAP financial, and we will call out the specific items for you to treat in your models the way you best -- that you decide are best to handle.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. Mr. Peribere, I will now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, I want to thank you for attending today. We have published those results and our guidance for 2013. We are -- we have had the month of January, which we would qualify as being satisfactory. It confirms that there's been some destocking in December, and at the very same time, we are looking forward for achieving the guidance that we have given to you during the pre-call and during this earnings call. We look forward to talk to you in the second quarter. And with this, I'd like to close this conference. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much for your participation in today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am?","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors.","Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or at the SEC's website at sec.gov.","We will also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Included in today's presentation on slide 3, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complements some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. On our call today, we will cover our third quarter results, outlook for the year-end, and provide an update on our capital allocation strategy, post the close of the Diversey sale.","You will have also the opportunity to hear from Ted Doheny who will be taking over as CEO from me on January 1, and Bill Stiehl, our acting Chief Financial Officer. But before all and relevant to my retirement, I take this opportunity to let you know that I ran my first marathon in New York last Sunday, thanks to my son, Alexi (02: 47) and my friend, Allen (02: 48). For those of you who are up to the challenge, you will be rewarded for life. But don't worry I will not turn into Forrest Gump in my retirement.","Back to business, you can see that in the third quarter net sales growth accelerated to 6% on an as reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%.","Our performance in the third quarter continued to improve compared to the first half of the year when we delivered 3% constant dollar top line growth and 18% margin and this momentum is continuing into the fourth quarter and we are delivering on our 2017 outlook as a result of our highest sales in our pricing and cost disciplines.","In fact, we are executing on our long-term profitable growth strategy that we outlined at the Analyst Day in June 2015. Remember, at that time we set a 3-year sales growth target of 4% to 5% for each of those two divisions. We said that we expected sales growth to accelerate throughout the period of 2016 to 2018 and that these growth would be led by volume, thanks to our market maker innovative strategy. In 2016, we didn't see much movement on the top line and exited the year with an increase of just 1% constant dollar sales growth.","However, our growth have been improving each quarter since the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of last year, we started delivering in constant currency 1% sales growth. In the first quarter of this year, in constant dollars, we delivered 3% growth. In the second quarter, we delivered 4% growth, and now in the third quarter, we are reporting 5% constant currency sales growth. And should the temporary and incredibly steep PE resin cost increases of 13%, or $0.10 per pound since August and $0.15 year-to-date, not have surprised all of our industry, those sales gain would have translated into the bottom line already.","The good news is that I said temporary cost increases. And also that we have fully implemented our announced Product Care and Food Care price increases on September 1 and October 1 respectively. This is where our confidence comes in as we head into year-end. We are seeing rapid adoption of our game changing solutions. We're seeing healthy end-market demand, particularly in North America and Asia and our now famous operational disciplines are taking hold.","On September 6, we closed the Diversey sale. When we announced the transaction in March 2017, we increased our share repurchase program, and we said that we would pay down debt, address stranded costs, and target selective M&A that was aligned with our strategic direction. Through September 30, we repurchased approximately 15.5 million shares valued at $677 million through a combination of open market and accelerated share repurchase programs, including an ASR that is currently ongoing.","We paid down $1.1 billion in debt, bringing our total debt balance down to $3.3 billion. We have already made progress on our cost structure and will continue to do so heading into next year. We also closed two acquisitions: a small strategic food packaging company in Brazil, Deltaplam, which closed in August and, then in October, we closed the Fagerdala acquisition, a protective packaging company based in Singapore that significantly expands our presence in Asia.","As all of you know on September 9, I announced my retirement effective December 31, 2017. I have really enjoyed my time at Sealed Air, and I'm extremely proud of what we have become, thanks to the vision and determination of our management team and our 14,000 global employees who I want to recognize here.","We have built a winning culture, a culture that is obsessed with creating new value for our customers. We take the responsibility of being the industry leader and the market maker by creating new markets with disruptive innovations and instilling discipline throughout the industries we serve.","Our long-term profitable growth strategy is well under way, and we continue to gain traction globally as you could see from our sales growth focusing all of our efforts on some very key megatrends.","Our journey as a knowledge-based company continues with many exciting opportunities ahead. And I am very confident that under Ted, Bill and the entire leadership team, the organization will continue to thrive and generate significant value for our customers, shareholders and employees.","Bill joined Sealed Air in 2013 and has been on this journey alongside our senior leadership team. Ted and I continue to work closely together to ensure a seamless and successful transition. We have been spending time in Charlotte, North Carolina and now also traveling around the world with our senior team to meet with customers and employees.","Let me now move back to our third quarter results in more detail, and turning to slide 6 where we highlight our results by region. We experienced constant dollar year-over-year growth across all regions. North America once again was our fastest-growing region at 7%, with sales up 9% in Food Care and up 4% in Product Care. Sales in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America increased in the range of 2% to 3%. I want to highlight that Product Care sales in Asia Pacific were up 15% in the third quarter, led by volume growth.","On slide 7, you can see our volume and price mix trends by division and by region. As we anticipated, top line performance was primarily driven by 5% volume growth with positive trends across all regions. Food Care volumes were up 5% with 9% growth in North America and positive trends in both Latin America and EMEA. Product Care volumes were up 6%, driven by our largest regions, North America and EMEA, increasing 4% and 7% respectively. Overall price mix was relatively neutral to our top line results. Keep in mind that our pricing actions in Product Care went into effect as of September 1 and in Food Care for our non-formula customers effective October 1.","And now, let's turn to slide 8 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care sales were $716 million and adjusted EBITDA was $158 million, or 22% of sales. Sales were up 4% in constant dollars compared to last year due to higher volumes. Our margin compressed year-over-year primarily due to timing of raw material cost factors and higher input costs. It is important to note, however, that sequentially EBITDA margins improved 60 basis points as formulas started to align better with higher input costs, and we continued our focus on expense management.","Our performance in North America which accounted for 51% of Food Care sales was driven by the ongoing adoption of our case-ready platform across all protein including seafood and higher equipment sales. We capitalized on end market demand in all protein segments led by an increase in slaughter rates of more than 5% in the beef sector. We expect our business in North America to continue outpacing the market in Q4, although keep in mind, we have tougher year-over-year comparables on volume to come.","EMEA, which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales was essentially flat compared with last year. We are continuing to see adoption of our new products in an environment where the protein market is growing modestly, but this was offset by timing of equipment sales. Heading into year-end, we anticipate improving top line trends with growth coming from both equipment and new product sales.","APAC accounted for 15% of Food Care with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Australia and New Zealand declined in the quarter as a result of further deterioration in the dairy market. But an encouraging data point to share is that for the first time in over a year, slaughter rates in Australia were relatively flat with prior year. The beef cycle is now near bottom, and we expect growth to return late 2018.","Latin America represented the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 80% of Food Care sales. Constant dollar sales were up 3% led by growth in Argentina and stabilizing trends in Brazil.","This was offset by a temporary decline in Mexico where our business was impacted by the earthquake late in the quarter. But heading into year-end, we anticipate improving trends in both Brazil and Mexico, albeit slow, with continued growth in Central America. For the full year 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales approximately 3.5% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margin are expected to be approximately 22%.","Slide 9 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $415 million and adjusted EBITDA was $87 million, or 21% of net sales. You can see in the EBITDA bridge that, compared to last year, higher volumes were offset by a negative mix and price\/cost spread. Product Care margins improved sequentially by 100 basis points, this improvement was primarily related to higher volumes, yield on our pricing actions and cost management.","North America and EMEA accounted for approximately 85% of Product Care sales and were up 4% and 7% respectively. APAC had another strong quarter with 15% growth led by China and Japan. Our advanced product portfolio, including inflatable I-Pack, self wrap and FloWrap, continued to gain significant traction as our e-commerce and fulfillment customers optimized and automated their distribution channels.","In Western Europe, I want to highlight that in the third quarter, we benefited from accelerated execution of automated solutions, volume growth of our consumables after record level of equipment installs over the last 12 months and pockets of strength across some of the industrial segments. With the acquisition of Fagerdala, we tripled our manufacturing footprint in China and as you would expect, there are synergies to leverage and meaningful cross-selling opportunities.","For the full year of 2017, we expect Product Care to increase sales approximately 6% on a constant-dollar basis which would include $20 million in sales from Fagerdala. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be approximately 20%. And this implies Q4 constant dollar year-over-year growth of approximately 10% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%.","Let me now turn the call over to Bill to review our overall sales and EBITDA bridges and outlook heading into year-end. Bill?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Jerome. Slides 11 and 12 provide the net sales and EBITDA bridges for Q3 and nine-months ending September 30.","My comments will focus on slide 11 which highlights our third quarter results from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. You can see that our top line performance was primarily led by higher volumes of $55 million and favorable currency of $13 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $217 million, or 19% of sales. Volume contributed $23 million in Q3, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and price\/cost spread of $16 million. Operating expenses decreased $10 million and restructuring savings were $4 million. Currency had a favorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $3 million. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.46 in the third quarter compared to $0.41 in Q3 of 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations was 31%.","On slide 12, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the nine-months ending September 30. In the EBITDA bridge, we see that higher volumes were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price\/cost spread.","Turning to slide 13. Free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the nine months ended September 30, consolidated free cash flow excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey was a source of cash of $267 million. CapEx was $127 million, cash interest payments were $153 million, and restructuring costs were $49 million, aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital, and other assets and liabilities or use of cash of $70 million.","Turning to our outlook on slide 14. For top line, we now expect sales to be approximately $4.4 billion, an increase of 6% on an as-reported basis. Favorable FX is expected to have an impact of approximately $40 million. Constant dollar growth is expected to be approximately 4.5%, including sales from Fagerdala of $20 million. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q3; the Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales.","2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $830 million, which includes $7 million from favorable FX. Corporate expenses are now estimated to be $115 million.","Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $185 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be $160 million. We now expect our adjusted tax rate to be 30% for the full year 2017. Our outlook for adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at $1.75 to $1.80. Our adjusted EPS outlook is based on 190 million shares, which reflects the weighted-average full-year effect of share repurchases through September 30.","Let's now turn to slide 15 and review our free cash flow outlook. As a reminder, we present free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes our outlook for continuing operations and results from discontinued operations. We continue to expect free cash flow to be approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we start with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full-year 2017 outlook from continuing operations of $830 million.","We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs excluding efforts dedicated to reducing separation related costs are estimated to be $55 million. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $175 million, of which $155 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $20 million in 2017 and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimate.","Working capital and other assets and liabilities is now expected to be a use of cash of approximately $40 million as compared to our previous guidance of a use of cash of $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.","I would like to now pass the call over to Ted who will provide us with early insights and thoughts on our future opportunities and strategic direction. On behalf of the senior leadership team and our employees, we would like to welcome you to Sealed Air and congratulate you on your new role.","Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Bill. As Jerome indicated, I started at Sealed Air mid-September, and my short story is that I liked the company even more looking inside than I did analyzing it from the outside. I've been traveling the world to meet with employees and customers and have also had the opportunity to visit some of our facilities including spending time with the talented team from Fagerdala in China.","My previous experience has been with two iconic and market-leading companies in the equipment, service and solutions space. When I was approached about the opportunity with Sealed Air, I saw another iconic company that has successfully transformed over these past five years from a product- driven to market-driven company.","As I learn more about Sealed Air, I see that we have an exciting opportunity to now move from being a leading company in the packaging industry to be the world-class company solving the most complex challenges in packaging with automated solutions. Sealed Air's reputation of being a true innovative leader within the Global Packaging segment is impressive, and our pipeline of automation in both Product Care and Food Care is creating even more opportunities to further reimagine the business and think outside the box and maybe even outside the package.","In 2018, we'll build off our sales growth in 2017 and gain share in the markets we serve. We will execute our strategy with both sales and profit growth, as well as operational excellence that will demonstrate incremental margin improvement over 2017. We'll continue to allocate capital as we outlined with share buybacks and strategic M&A. With $1.4 billion remaining under the authorized share buyback program, we'll continue to be active in the market with open market and accelerated share repurchases.","On M&A, we'll focus on companies that expand our market presence geographically and take our innovations to adjacent markets. We'll look for technology and automation companies that further enhance our Food Care and Product Care businesses that solve our customers' toughest packaging challenges. Our organic growth, M&A strategy, and focus on operational excellence will take our business to the next level of performance. We plan on sharing our 2018 and long-term profitable growth plans with you in the coming months, including an Investor Day later next year.","Before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to remind you our fourth quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, February 8.","So, with that, Vince, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. And congratulations, Jerome, not only on the retirement but the marathon. And congrats to Ted and Bill as well.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","My question was, Jerome, really if I look at \u2013 to your point, you've had the significant margin pressure related to resin prices year-to-date. So if I look at slide 12 in the deck, there's, right, $54 million of mix and price cost spread. So can you help us sort of parse that mix versus price cost spread out so that we can sort of think about this on a go-forward basis if and when resin prices start to decline?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. So you -first of all, you have seen with all our competitors that everybody in the industry has been surprised by the pace of the cost increase in resin and the number. So, let me remind you, $0.15 since the beginning of the year. That's almost 20%. And $0.10 since August 1.That's about 13%. And here we're talking about PE. I'm not talking about nylon. I'm not talking about other raw materials which went up in a very steep way.","So this is in light of us having in Food Care a sizable part of our business which is formula driven. And remember also that in the month of July and before, we were thinking, and not only us everybody was thinking, that because of the capacity addition coming onstream, prices were not going to go up. They were going to come down.","So, yes, we did have margin squeeze. I would call it margin compression. And, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are seeing that this is temporary, and that as a result of that, we are going to do what we have done in the last round. When resin prices went down, we are going to recoup the quality of our business. So I'm really not worried. And we are going to start seeing this, in my mind, definitely in 2018 depending on the pace again at which resins are going to be coming down.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. I'll also add my congratulations to everybody on their new roles, including you, Jerome.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","My question is sort of really on price\/mix and just sort of the lack of lift there. I guess I would have thought by now we'd start to see some of the formula-based pricing from earlier in the year when resin started to move up, kick in. Just wondering if there's some offsetting factors on there on the mix side of things. And maybe you could just comment on the overall pricing environment outside of the moves in resin. We've heard from a couple of other guys in the industry about some pricing pressure just in response to weak end demand in some other food-related products, weak customer margins. Are you seeing any pressure to pass through some of that deflation that we're seeing in food these days and these price increases that you've announced for September 1 and October 1, are you getting any significant customer pushback to those so far?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So let me start with the last part of your question. Our September 1 Product Care price increase went through fully. Our October non-formula pricing Food Care price increase went in fully. Why? Because we had PE margins and nylon and so on margin compression, and we also had other type of inflation, including freight. And for those of you who don't know that post-Harvey had consequences on freight cost, availability of trucks, needing to buy resins on the spot market, and all of those kind of things because our priority number one was to delight our customers who were in difficult times for supply themselves, et cetera. And we did not spare any efforts nor any money in making sure that we would have absolutely no disruption.","Did that cost money? Absolutely. But what is absolutely important to understand is what I said exactly five years ago in January 2012 when I said we are the market leader. The market leader has a responsibility. And the responsibility for the market leader is to be disciplined and to lead on price. Yes, we do need to be leading on price. We have led on price, which is why we stood extraordinarily firm. Yes, we did hear that some competitors were not as disciplined. That's their problem.","In order to keep investing the amount of money we're investing in innovation; in order to bring them, our customers, the revolutionary solutions that we're bringing them, and surprise them by adding value, tremendous new value to them, we need to be able to have the funds and the resources. And, therefore, keep investing at the pace we're investing and, by the way, accelerating to bring those solutions in automation, in new products, et cetera, et cetera. So that is the context.","Next to that, you do have \u2013 and this is why we are already slightly improving on our margins compared to the first half of the year as a result of having this September 1 price increase in Product Care and such (32: 35). So do we have competition? Yes, we do have competition. But you have customers who are price-driven customers, which are not the ones we want; and you have customers who are value customers, which is those we want. And we are absolutely committed to continue, thanks to our solutions, to add new additional and much higher value than they could get from a slight price concession.","Do we have market skirmishes here and there? Of course, but not very much more than before. Depending on the country, including in the U.S., we had some competitors who were a little bit desperate in taking business, but this is normal.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, could we jump to the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details. Again, congratulations to everybody and welcome. And also, thanks to Carol for all her efforts the last couple years. I wanted to come back to the margin question a little bit differently. Can you tell us maybe in rank-order priority, what gives you confidence that in 2018 that you'll be able to leverage the very, very good volume growth to date, and presumably positive volume growth into 2018 into stronger EBITDA? Will it be more from the pricing? Will it be more from the formula lags turning more favorably? And what, Ted, do you think, at this juncture, can operational excellence add to the margin picture for 2018? Thank you.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good. Thanks, George. I'll start and Ted will continue. George, all of the above and our innovation, which means that you saw that we have renewed with constant currency growth in the fourth quarter of 2016. And since then it's been on and on and accelerating. The comparables are going to get a little bit tougher, but it is our innovation which is fueling all of this, the success of the strategy that we have embarked into in Product Care moving to automation.","The very successful B+ acquisition of August 2015 continues at a fast pace. The deployment of those automation technologies in Japan, in China, in Europe, and in North America had some tremendous success. And also our automation in Food Care with Cogni Link and CogniPRO (35: 34), and on the other end, our case-ready which is really starting to take hold. So we're very confident that we are exactly on the pace to do and execute on what we said back in June 2015 when we gave the 2016 to 2018 look during our Analyst Day. It is actually amazing to see how what we said at that time is happening.","Then back to your question on margin. We have formulas in Food Care and they have been a little bit slower to kick in because they would have kicked in \u2013 they were supposed to kick in from the third quarter as resins were coming down and as formulas was coming up, leading to margin expansion. And as resins came up, you see that this phenomenon is slightly delayed. And we have proven to you in the past that in an environment like the one we're going to lead through probably through the end of this year and into early next year, we are going to restore our margins. You had a quick follow-up to Ted on the operational excellence maybe.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. So just in terms of what you've just discussed, just quickly, what's most important? Is it the innovation? Is it the price? Or is it the formula? I just want again kind of a stack rank if that's possible. If not, I understand.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","I can't stack because I don't have the detail of every single...","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","...number there. But it is all of the above. We do have a tremendous pull (37: 26) from our innovation. You know that depending on the division, some of those kick in faster than some others. The operation on trade needs to be approved by the retailer. This is done through \u2013 and we talked about this...","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","...on the cycle of innovation. And in some Product Care, it comes faster. And we're seeing all of those benefits. But there is discipline in this thing. The good thing about Sealed Air is that we say what we do and what we do what we say. And we are a disciplined organization. We are executing on it. And we demand value from our customers because we know we are bringing them tremendous value in the total cost to serve operation that they run.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And on op excellence?","Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. Well, let me segue those two going into three, because you're talking about 2018. And internally, that's the one that I'm possessive about. On the pricing, just to make a comment, Jerome has just done a tremendous job. And one thing I just wanted to let you, George, and everybody know that I'll be taking over as the Chief Pricing Officer from Jerome. So feel comfortable with that. Some of the pricing opportunities we have I think are in the business that we need to look at and push pricing for certain options, other things that are there. So we have some pricing opportunity going forward.","On the innovation side, as Jerome highlighted, that's been really exciting for me in just my first six weeks to see how we're at the table, not with itty-bitty but with the big players. Jerome has introduced me, I've got to meet some of the major players, and we're there talking about their biggest problems. If we stay in that commodity base where some of our competitors are, then we have to live with the pricing and that will bring up operational excellence. We got to continue to drive our cost down. But with these innovations, for instance, statistic on flatscreen TVs going to the Internet, over half of them are being shipped. The number one problem that major ecommerce customers are having is damage. How could we fix that? We're at the table to do that.","The second problem is making it easy and environmentally friendly for where it shows up. So we're on conservation not what is the price of your product, can you help us solve this problem, bring that solution across, and we have some really cool innovative technology that we're talking about the solution and there's no conversation what was widget A versus widget B last year. So that ties innovation into the pricing and the margin that you want to see.","The third piece is the operational excellence. I think we have an opportunity to really drive the business to world-class level in operational excellence. We've had a huge disruption in the business with the sale of Diversey. Really bringing the team together, looking at our facilities around the world, what can we do to bring some operational excellence to the bottom line in 2018. I think we have some opportunities there and give you bridgeable items. We're not giving any guidance on 2018, but just to give you some thoughts on what we're looking at.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Your line is open.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. Bill and Ted, congratulations. And Jerome, it's obviously been a pleasure working with you over the years. And on behalf of the team, good luck as you head into the future.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So, as for my question, given the significant improvement in 2017 and the related tougher comparisons, what is your volume growth expectations for the North American Food Care business specifically, kind of as we head into the end of the year and specifically as we think about 2018?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So I'm not going to give you a guidance for 2018. But in 2017 for the rest of the year, we have \u2013 in my prepared remarks, I made a comment about that, and we said that we are expecting about 3.5% or 4%. Altogether \u2013 what did you say? 4%. Lori said 4%.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","4.5%.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","4.5%, Lori said. And, actually, what does this mean? It means that the momentum keeps on. It means that we have the North American cycle in full swing. Exports are good and strong. The slaughter rate is good and strong. And we are right now in the middle of the quarter, and there is nothing else to say than that.","We're also looking at other protein. And the reason why we are, and it is as successful. And you hear about the beef cattle cycle at 5% slaughter rate increase, but you see our total business being very solid. And you know that our red \u2013 our meat, our cattle, beef prices or beef products are only a part of the whole thing, and we are having success with our case-ready solutions all over. And there is a change in the marketplaces, including in North America with our case-ready solutions because the market is changing, because of the need for sustainability, because, for example, California having banned foam trays and those kinds of things. And therefore, you have MAP, modified atmosphere packaging, and you have our Darfresh which is kicking in very nicely. So we're confident. 2018, you're going to see that there is \u2013 that the comparable there will be easier, but when Ted is going to give you a guidance for the company and by businesses in February, this momentum is there and this is not a commodity business. The momentum is there.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, good morning and congratulations to all and all the best to you, Jerome, as you move on to the next place, next phase.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","My question has to do with thinking about e-commerce. I know it's still relatively small but growing very quickly, and obviously, a big factor as we think about Product Care. And I know in the past, it's intended to be in products that are growing but yet have smaller margins. And I just didn't know as you think about, Ted, the future, how you think that proportion will grow as a percentage of the total segment and what do you think the ultimate margin impact will be from ecommerce, in Product Care?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","You will love the Investor Day when it comes and you will get under-the-tent on our ecommerce 3PL solution. Having said that, and let me stay with the present, Ted will talk about the future. But with regards to the present, we had slight negative mix, which is being corrected, I can't say day-after-day but month-after-month as we are introducing our automation solutions and innovations, which are not only automation solutions. There are some very big phone companies who launch new products and they have our solution as the product in which their phones are packed through the Internet. And this is big business.","And it is this innovation and it is this need for not only addressing dimensional weight, which is the number one cash costs operation in the cost-to-serve of ecommerce ,number one is dimensional weight, which means freight cost. The number two is labor productivity, is labor. Number three, damage when the items are fragile; number one, it is the cost of packaging. What we do is reducing freight costs, is improving labor productivity, eliminating damage, and we do that with a little, slowest, smallest cost component, which is our packaging cost and the solution, which adds total value to our customers. So, yes, this ecommerce and 3PL business is growing much faster and the margins are improving quarter after quarter as we address our \u2013 as we introduce our innovation and our solutions. So that's important to understand because it was an issue in 2016, a little bit in the beginning of 2017, and it is being gradually and nicely corrected. Ted, future of Product Care?","Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure, and to answer the question, to tie into the operational excellence again, if we're going to commit to operating margin leverage, consistent and reliable, that means the product portfolio has got to match. And if you look at ecommerce, not mentioning any customer names, but imagine one of the largest ecommerce companies buying a food company, it's going to bring us together pretty quickly. That means that we're going to be shipping most of this stuff and extending the shelf life that has made Food Care the dominant player in the industry. Now the shelf life has to go to the truck life, to the plane life. And so, they're having to solve these problems with us, so the problems that we're bringing in are actually in the solutions.","In the Product Care, to the point of where we get ecommerce quickly, because that's moving \u2013 everybody sees these products showing up at their homes, you don't want to see the polystyrene or \u2013 as I'm being trained by Jerome \u2013 or the Styrofoam all over your house. It's a problem. You don't want to see these packages that you're unpacking. You can even hurt yourself. So we're working on some innovative designs, and I mentioned the flat-screen TV. Over half are now being purchased on the Internet. So our solutions that we're working on when you pull that out of the box, make it nice and pretty. Maybe \u2013 do you really need the box? Do you need that Styrofoam that you're throwing away? So the margins, to answer your question, have to be in line with our portfolio, higher than our portfolio, as we bring these new innovations. How we're doing it? We're saving our customers a tremendous amount of money is pulling the solutions. So, short answer, the new innovations for Product Care have to be at higher margins than the existing portfolio.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Freuchtel of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Morning, Jason.","Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Fagerdala seems like an ideal acquisition target given its exposure to Asian technology. Can you spend some time elaborating on the attractive aspects of Fagerdala? And are these aspects potentially telling of what you're looking for in future acquisitions? Thank you and good luck on your next marathon, Jerome.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you.","Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.","Do you want me to take this one?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","I'll just start because I was intimately with Ken Chrisman in the early negotiations. And I will tell you that most companies look at the products and they look at the segment in which the target participates, et cetera. What I did really look at is quality of management.","We all know that when you buy a Chinese company in China, you have to do your due diligence extremely tightly because you sometimes never know what you buy. We bought a Singaporean company which has operations and its major operations in China. So, we bought quality, quality, quality. What we also bought is superb management. That is really very important. And on top of that, we bought an extraordinarily efficient fabricator. And (51: 12) has traveled with Ken to see their operation and will make comments. And the short story is that he was very impressed with what we intend to do. And remember, fabrication is not what we do, but we want to be Chinese in China. We are becoming Chinese in China, and this is extremely important. Ted?","Edward L. Doheny - Sealed Air Corp.","No, that's a good summary. And as Jerome highlighted, in my six weeks, I got to spend a week in China looking at the operation and actually two full days with Ken, and got to meet the Fagerdala team. And if we look at the product and why this makes sense strategically, as Jerome highlighted, it's an integrated manufacturer. Instead of us selling the polyethylene to an integrator and letting them do that value add, this is what they do and they do really, really well.","And as Jerome said, they win in China and I got to witness this. I got to meet with their three largest customers who happen to be the three largest PC manufacturers in the world in China. So, they were at the table. They're talking what they can do to be their committed supplier in this area. And also, those suppliers are asking them, can we move that now to the other facilities around the world. So not only does it have geographic growth potential for integrated packaging, it also has the potential to go outside.","The second piece on there is the China piece that, being in China, I wish I didn't have so much experience on China, you have to be \u2013 in China you have to be Chinese to win in China. And I was extremely impressed with their management team. Three full days from the top, watching the people on the shop floor, seeing their facilities where they do things very, very different than we do. I think the complement there is going to be exciting for us, but they win in China and the customers, these major PC manufacturers are asking, can we bring that solution outside of China as we grow this business. So, pretty exciting opportunity for us.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Langton of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thank you. Just had a question on corporate expense. I now you lowered the guidance to $115 million from $125 million, so I was just kind of wondering what was driving that, and then also to see if there's any change to your sort of the longer-term outlook which I think was reducing unallocated by $25 million by 2018 and then reducing stranded costs by about half in two years.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes. Thank you for your question. One of the things that I've noticed with the Sealed Air management team over the years of being here is our ability to quickly adapt to changing business conditions and also to contract spending when the conditions actually merit that action. This, along with our initial actions to reduce the unallocated and the stranded cost, is why we're now estimating our corporate expenses to be approximately $115 million for the full-year 2017.","Ted and I have actually been meeting quite a bit, working together on our specific plans to address these stranded costs, as well as unallocated costs going forward. And we'll continue to support the growth initiatives while, at the same time, addressing stranded cost, relative to the types of cost, we've said that we have $20 million of unallocated costs and they're actually going to be offset by transition services agreement revenue. That TSA revenue actually began on September 6 when we closed the Diversey transaction, and they will go forward on a 12 to an 18-month period beginning in September of 2017 and will also then give us time to specifically reduce those unallocated costs.","Meanwhile, for the $20 million of stranded costs, we are absolutely on-track and we're very confident that our 24-month target, which is 24 months since the separation, is achievable and we will work towards that goal.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Our last question is from Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you and welcome, Ted and Bill. And, Jerome, good luck.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Just one quick question on the timing of the remaining share buyback.

I mean, just want to a get a sense on what you're thinking there, Ted.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure. We have $1.4 billion remaining on the share buyback program. As we stated, we used 190 million shares for the guidance that we gave for the balance of 2017.

And just for the capital allocation story there, to commit to the share buyback as we've announced, but also looking at that what is the strategic M&A opportunities that we're looking at.

Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Lori. And good morning, everyone. Our comments today will focus on the second quarter and our outlook. But before I get started, I want to briefly highlight significant events that have taken place in June and July.","First, let me highlight our Analyst Day that took place on June 18. For those of you who couldn't make it, if you haven't done so already, I would encourage you to visit our IR website, download the presentation and listen to the replay. To quickly recap, we outlined our financial and operational objectives for 2018 and our key targets for 2020. We discussed in detail how those objectives and targets will be achieved as we continue executing on our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy.","We have executed on many Get Fit programs to-date, but as we discussed at our Analyst Day, we still have more to be done. And we will stay focused on driving profitable growth and margin expansion opportunities. We clearly defined our Change the Game strategy and outlined the investments that we're making in new markets, new business models, and disruptive innovation. You have all heard me say this before, but let me remind you that our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is not a destination, it is a journey. And that journey is already transforming us into a knowledge-based company with unique knowhow, resolutely dedicated to making our customers win and sharing in the value being created.","Second, earlier in June, we completed the refinancing of our 2021 senior notes and issued new U.S. and euro senior notes that extended maturities, increased covenants flexibility, and reduced our annualized interest expense. With the completion of this transaction, we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program on July 15, which reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders.","And with that, let me now turn to what I would qualify a very strong second quarter. At this point, I'm sure that you've had a chance to review our press release and earnings results for the second quarter.","Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 3.3% on an organic basis, which excludes both currency headwinds and the results from North America tray and pads business, which was sold at the beginning of April in 2015. Adjusted gross margins were up 260 basis points compared to last year as a result of favorable price mix, lower input costs, and manufacturing improvements.","Our adjusted EBITDA was a record of $308 million, or 17.2% of net sales, an organic increase of 25%. Our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 280 basis points with both Food Care and Product Care delivering 20%-plus margins for the second consecutive quarter. And while Diversey Care was hit the hardest by currency, it delivered 12% adjusted EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis.","Let me now turn to slide four where we present our performance by region for the second quarter. On an organic basis, North America sales were up over 2% compared to last year. Food Care and Diversey Care were up approximately 4%. And in Product Care, North America declined approximately 2% as a result of rationalization efforts and weakness in the manufacturing and electronic sectors.","The Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, was up 3% in constant dollars and down 15% on an as reported basis as a result of currency devaluation. In constant dollars, Russia was our fastest growing country with growth of 26%. Turkey was up 7%, Italy was up 6%, both Germany and Spain were up 4%, and France and Holland were flat to slightly up. Growth in these countries was offset by a slight decline in the UK and in Switzerland. The nine countries I just referenced accounting for approximately 24% of the second quarter consolidated sales.","In APAC, we delivered constant currency growth of 4% and a decline of 5% on an as reported basis. And in constant dollars, Australia was up 6%, led by Food Care, India and Southeast Asia were up 8%, and New Zealand was up 2%. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was 9%, primarily driven by double-digit growth in Mexico and Argentina, offset by a 3% decline in Brazil.","Let's now turn to slide five, and this highlights the results of our Food Care division in the second quarter. Food Care sales increased 4.2% on an organic basis with growth across all the regions. Favorable price mix was 2.7% and volume was up 1.5%. We had favorable price mix and positive volume trends in every region except Latin America, where volume was negatively impacted by the market conditions in Brazil.","Net sales in constant dollars in Latin America were up 11%, APAC increased 5%, EMEA was up 2%. And on an organic basis, North America increased 4%. We delivered strong double-digit constant dollar sales growth in Russia, Argentina, Mexico; and mid to high single-digit growth in Italy, Australia, and New Zealand. We experienced constant dollar declines in France and Brazil, two countries that each account for 3% to 4% of our global Food Care sales. China, which is approximately 2% of our Food Care sales, was down 7%, primarily due to weakness in our hygiene business.","In North America, cattle production was down 8%, which was offset by mid single-digit growth in smoked and processed food and poultry. Fresh red meat is our largest market, and yet despite declines in the cattle market, we still delivered 4% organic growth in North America. Our fresh red meat business was up slightly and we experienced strong growth in the poultry market. This performance was a result of continued adoption of our advanced product offering, and overall in North America, we had favorable price mix and volume growth.","For the remainder of the year, we expect continued decline in the beef market, but at the decelerating rate than that we have been experiencing over the last nine to 12 months. In Europe, we have seen a slight improvement in the protein market. The improved market conditions, coupled with the adoption of our new, very successful products, resulted in a 4.5% constant dollar growth rate in our European food packaging business. We are experiencing increased demand for Darfresh on Tray and OptiDure and have also been successful in our value-added selling approach.","Turning to Food Care's adjusted EBITDA performance, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $174 million, which is a 10% increase on an as reported basis and a 27% increase on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.5% were up 410 basis points. This increase was largely a result of an improved mix of premium products, portfolio management, global pricing initiatives, and cost synergies.","Within our European hygiene business, it is worth noting that we have seen a meaningful increase in our EBITDA margins as a result of our portfolio management efforts and pricing initiatives. As we head into the back half of the year, we expect further adoptions of our new products on a global basis and continue to focus on value-added selling. However, this will be partially offset by formula pricing in North America, currency headwinds and other external factors, including, for example, the fact that the slaughter rates in Australia are starting to decline and will further do that.","Some of these external focus also include economic challenges in Brazil and Venezuela, and a slowdown in Australia, as I just mentioned. We anticipate EBITDA growth in the second half of the year, but not at the same rate experienced in the first half. And for the full year 2015, we are on track to deliver strong annual EBITDA growth and margin expansion.","Slide six highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3.8% in the second quarter. Favorable price mix was up 2.2% and volume increased 1.6%. We delivered favorable price mix and positive volume trends in all the regions. Our fastest growing regions in the quarter were Latin America and North America, with constant daily sales growth of 9% and 5%, respectively. Asia Pacific was up 3.5% and EMEA over 2%. From an end-market perspective, we experienced increased demand in food service, hospitality and healthcare, and we also experienced increased demand in our distribution channels.","EMEA accounts for approximately 50% of our net sales, as you know. And among our largest markets throughout this region, we experienced high single-digit growth in Turkey, positive sales in France, Italy, Holland and Germany. Challenging economic condition and instability are slowing down Russian and local tourism in Turkey and Dubai.","In addition, the ongoing economic crisis in Greece is also negatively impacting tourism, and this decline in tourism, which we are currently experiencing, would have an impact in the second half of the year in our hospitality market, especially in the third quarter. North America accounts for 30% of our net sales and delivered 5% constant dollar sales growth with increasing demand from our hospitality and healthcare segments.","In Asia Pacific, double-digit growth in India and Australia was partially offset by softness in China. Performance in Latin America was driven by growth in Argentina and Chile, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Brazil.","Diversey Care delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of $69 million, or 12.9% of net sales in the quarter. And as we anticipate, currency translation negatively impacted our performance in the quarter, and on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA declined 5%. In constant dollars, however, adjusted EBITDA was up 12% compared to last year. This growth was driven by our success in our value-added selling approach, high volumes and cost synergies, partially offset by higher SG&A as we continue to heavily invest in sales and marketing and R&D to further support growth opportunities.","For example, we're already seeing strong interest in our robotic floor care machines with our recent acquisition of Intellibot, and are having many conversations with our customers around our Internet of Clean solutions. As a result, we're accelerating our investment in both equipment and data analytics into year-end. And despite these investments and currency headwinds, we're still on track to deliver EBITDA growth on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion for the full year.","Slide seven highlights the results from our Product Care division. Net sales were essentially unchanged in constant dollars on a year-over-year basis. We had favorable price mix of just over 1% on volumes that declined nearly 2%. Favorable price mix continues to be driven by our pricing efforts across global \u2013 both global performance packaging and general packaging. Second quarter volume was impacted in fact by rationalization efforts in Latin America and to a lesser extent also in North America. Our rationalization efforts are focused on our general packaging solutions, and should be mostly behind us by mid 2016.","On a regional basis, North America net sales were down 1.6% in constant currency, while EMEA was up 3.6%. It is also worth noting that both China and Japan were up in the mid to high single-digits. Excluding rationalization efforts in North America, net sales would have been slightly up. And as I said earlier, in North America, we experienced market weakness in manufacturing and electronics, but this was offset by strength in e-commerce and third-party logistics. Our growth in EMEA was due to increased demand in our performing packaging solutions, particularly in Germany and in Spain, which is recovering now.","On a global basis, we're seeing strong growth in both e-commerce and third-party logistics and are confident that this growth will continue for the foreseeable future, given our product breadth, global reach, and focused investment in performance-based packaging.","And let's now turn to adjusted EBITDA. Product Care delivered adjusted EBITDA of $79 million, which is a 10% increase on an as reported basis and an 18% increase in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.7% expanded 310 basis points compared to last year's results. This increase was a result of an increasing mix of global performance packaging and pricing discipline. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate continued EBITDA growth and margin expansion as well.","And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our total net sales, adjusted EBITDA, cash flow, and outlook. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide eight, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.8 billion in sales, an increase of 3.3% on an organic basis. Favorable price mix was 2.4%, or $48 million, and volume was up 1%, or $18 million. Unfavorable currency translation had an impact on net sales of $199 million, or 10%, mostly due to the declines in the euro and Russian ruble. Net sales on an as reported basis were down 9.6%.","Turning to slide nine, you can see our adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and first half of 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8.4% as reported to $308 million, or 17.2% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was largely due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $58 million.","Cost synergies also made a positive contribution of $16 million in the quarter. The North America trays and pads divesture had a $12 million negative comparison for adjusted EBITDA, and unfavorable currency translation was $34 million.","Despite currency headwind, we still delivered a 260 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and a 280 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to last year. On an organic basis, our adjusted EBITDA increased 25% as compared to the 2014 results for the same period.","Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.60 as compared to $0.42 in the second quarter last year.","Currency negatively impacted EPS by $0.09. The tax rate for the second quarter of 2015 was 29% as compared with 29.5% for the second quarter 2014. In the first quarter 2015, the tax rate was 25%, and we are still anticipating a 25% tax rate for the full year of 2015. The sequential increase from the first quarter was primarily due to higher taxable earnings in the U.S., which has one of our highest tax rate. For the full year, we expect to have higher earnings in some of our lower tax jurisdictions.","In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares for a total value of approximately $86 million. In the first half of 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares. And as of July 28, we have repurchased an additional 2.7 million shares, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to a total of 5.9 million shares.","Now, turning to slide 10, we outlined our price mix, volume trends, and sales price on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had favorable price mix in every division and in every region. Volume was up in Food Care and Diversey Care and, excluding rationalization effort, in Product Care, volume would have been up slightly. We delivered volume growth in all regions except Latin America, which was impacted by the economic environment in Brazil, as Jerome previously referenced, and our rationalization effort in Product Care. For the total company, we delivered 3.3% organic growth.","Turning to slide 11, you can see free cash flow was a source of $171 million for the first six months of the year, excluding the $235 million tax refund received related to the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of $119 million for the six months ending 2014 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management.","As many of you know, the company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13-month average target. For the 13-month period ending June 30, 2015, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 16%. This represents a 250 basis point improvement compared to June 30, 2014.","CapEx was $58 million and cash restructuring costs were $45 million for the six months ending June 30, 2015.","Our updated outlook for 2015 is presented on slide 12. We continue to expect net sales to be approximately $7.1 billion. Unfavorable currency is expected to be approximately 9%, or $700 million. Also, as a reminder, the trays and pads business generated approximately $200 million in sales in 2014. This disposition did not qualify under the accounting rules for treatment as discontinued operations. Therefore, prior years and the first quarter of 2015 include the North America trays and pads business, but there is no benefit from this business going forward nor was there any in the second quarter of this year. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and currency headwinds, we continue to anticipate an organic growth rate of approximately 3%.","Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.16 billion to $1.17 billion, which compares to our previous guidance of $1.14 billion to $1.16 billion. This reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year. We will continue to face currency challenges as compared to last year. We're now estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $110 million. We want you to keep in mind that in the third quarter of 2014, the euro was at $1.34 and in Q4 2014, the euro was at $1.26. Our forecast for the second half of the year assumes the euro at $1.10. Other currencies where we have exposure includes Russian ruble, the Brazilian real, and Australian dollar.","Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.28 as compared to 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. As a reminder, at our Analyst Day in June, we increased our EPS range by $0.03 to $2.11 to $2.18 to account for the interest savings related to our senior note refinancing. Our interest expense for 2015 will be $235 million, a $10 million reduction from the forecast we had provided earlier in the year. On an annualized basis, the senior note refinancing transaction will reduce our interest expense by $20 million. Constant currency earnings per share would be approximately $2.54 to $2.58, without the impact of currency.","As I highlighted earlier, we repurchased a total of 5.9 million shares as of July 28, and we will continue to be active in our share repurchase program. Our earnings per share outlook for 2015 is based on 209 million shares outstanding for the balance of the year, which reflects the weighted average full year effect of all the share repurchase completed as of July 28.","We are revising our free cash flow guidance to $585 million from the previous $575 million to reflect the higher adjusted EBITDA forecast. Our free cash flow outlook also excludes the $235 million refund related to the Grace settlement, which I previously referenced. Cash interest payments are expected to be $230 million as compared to our previous forecast of $240 million. And cash tax payments are now estimated at $115 million. We are on track to invest $210 million in capital expenditures and are still anticipating $120 million in restructuring activities. We also continue to estimate approximately $50 million in cost synergies for 2015 from these restructuring efforts.","This concludes my prepared remarks. But before we open the call to questions, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27, at 10 A.M.","Operator, can you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Sure. Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys, good morning.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Ghansham.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Can you first off update us on the volume outlook for each of the segments for the back half of the year? On protective packaging, do you think it'll remain down for the rest of the year? Diversey, there seems to be some momentum, should we expect that to continue into the back half? And also in Food, do you see any deviation from the first half volume run rate, anything else that we should think about? Thanks so much.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, good question, Ghansham. The volumes are there except in Product Care, but this is mostly the results of rationalization. So, what we had is a negative almost 2.5% globally in the first quarter in Product Care, and now it's about 1%. We're seeing this improve over time, and probably in the second half, definitely we are going to be hitting the e-commerce season and we're putting lots of efforts in some very specific sectors in there. And I must say that we are having or we are on the verge of having some pretty nice customer wins and so. We also are introducing quite nice new products, which have a lot of momentum. And this is in both equipment and in the new products themselves. So I would be \u2013 I'm quite positive that the very forceful efforts put by Ken and his forceful leadership are going to bring pretty good results.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Food Care?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","On Food Care \u2013 but on Food Care, it's quite interesting. We have had nice volume growth in an environment which is not necessarily very favorable. When you look at the overall market, you see that the red fresh meat market in the U.S. has been very depressed in the second quarter. I think I remember 8% reduction, which is one of the biggest negative percentages. We believe that the percentages of reduction are going to slowly taper down, but we haven't seen that yet.","In Brazil, the situation is really bad. There are many slaughterhouses which have been closing. I think the number is 15; JBS has recently published that they have closed five. And this is the result of drought, high prices of red meat at the cattle level, reducing purchasing power, and you know that red meat is an expensive meat and, as a result, there's been transfers into poultry. So we have had negative volume in Brazil. For the rest of the year, we are going to see \u2013 we're carefully optimistic \u2013 but the poultry market has been good for us and we expect that it is going to continue being good.","Our EMEA business is actually pulled by new products. And OptiDure, Darfresh on Tray are doing absolutely wonderful, and we're expecting those new products to continue pulling our business there. So we had positive growth, not as much in the second quarter as we had in the first quarter, but we believe that it's going to be okay.","Diversey has been improving its volume. And we had flat volume in Q1; we had definitely growth in Q2, and we're happy with what we're seeing here. So having said that, in Diversey, the comp in third quarter is not going to be very favorable because we had strong TASKI sales in Q3 of last year.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just looking at the change in EBITDA year-to-date, you put up about $114 million of mix and price-cost spread. Can you talk about that a little bit? How much is really coming from mix, how much is coming from price-cost spread, and how should we expect that to trend in the second half of the year?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So Scott, we really \u2013 we don't break that out \u2013 and I know Jerome will have a comment as it relates to some of our input costs. But we would expect for the second half of the year, and specifically with Food Care, we will have a benefit from some lower input costs. But at the same time, as everyone's aware, we do have the formula pricing for Food Care, as Jerome referenced in this opening remarks. And so that will narrow that positive price cost spread that we'll see in the second half compared to the first half. So, Jerome, I don't know if you want to make any specific comment.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I always like to \u2013 in a growing \u2013 in an increasing raw material environment, it is very important to see whether you've got price increases and whether you've got price. In a decreasing environment, and we have had that compared to 12 months ago, with resin, what is important is mostly to see whether you get margin expansion or whether you don't, to see \u2013 to look at your pricing discipline. The interesting thing is that we've got positive pricing. And we've got positive pricing in every single of our divisions, not as much as we got in the first quarter, but we've got positive pricing, and that is important.","That lead me to the second half and the resin prices. There have been attempts in North America to raise resin prices in July, it's not going through. And we'll see what August gives. But the volume overall is \u2013 and the business is fairly weak in the polyethylene arena, olefins arena globally. And we just don't believe at this point in time that there's going to be major price increases. And as a result of that, what we're going to be seeing is formula pricing gets its impact during the third quarter.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, Scott, I'll add to that just that when we referenced pricing, it isn't necessarily general across the board pricing increases. We've communicated frequently that we're being very focused in understanding the value that we're bringing to our customers, helping them understand that. And so some of our pricing actions are just going to our customers and making sure we're getting the value for what we've created. And again, just to emphasize it, it's very specific based on the values that we're bringing. So from that standpoint, there is a portion of it that is \u2013 it really is definitely mix because it's higher value solutions that we're bringing to the marketplace.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with BMO. Please proceed.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. I wondered, Jerome, if you can just talk about the impact of FX in terms of just sort of changing mix within any of your businesses as we look around the globe? For example, you would think that the weaker currency would be helping like fresh meat exports from places like Australia and Brazil.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So what you do have is \u2013 so I'm starting with Australia and Brazil and stuff. Yes, normally you should have that. It happens that the export markets for Brazil, as an example, is fairly weak. And you have some major companies out of Brazil, which I have made comments recently saying that not only the local market is very weak, their local market is extremely weak for fresh red meat, but also the export market is fairly weak for them also. And yes, you're right that normally a lower real should help, but it seems that the export markets are fairly weak.","With regards to Australia, the slaughter rates of the herds has been double-digits in the first quarter and is slightly coming down. And the reason is very normal. Those levels are completely unsustainable, completely unsustainable. And as a result of that, we are seeing a little bit less growth \u2013 very strong growth actually in Australia on our business, but a little bit less growth, not \u2013 the first quarter was, if I remember well, double-digits and here we're talking about high single-digit.","With regards to currency in general, we had $57 million of negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation when you take first quarter and second quarter combined. And we have said that we are seeing \u2013 that we are forecasting $110 million. My view is that it's likely to be slightly higher than that, because with oil being very low, with commodities, ag commodities, minerals being very low, countries like Brazil and so are going to be \u2013 have seen the real and their local currency devalue compared to the dollar \u2013 versus the dollar. And we might see further devaluations. I'm not going to anticipate too much, but this is why we need to be a little bit cautious, because the real is \u2013 was yesterday, I didn't check today, but it was at BRL 3.36 versus a forecast of \u2013 or versus what it was a year ago exactly at this time at about BRL 2.22, BRL 2.23 and versus the second quarter this year at BRL 3.10. So we have to be careful there.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Jerome, I had a couple of question again on volume. I guess, first of all, if possible, can you comment at all how much of the decline in Product Care was related to the downturn in manufacturing electronics, as you term it, how much of it was rationalization? And if I could tack on a part two, in Diversey, it was nice to see the volume growth there. Could you provide a bit more color in terms of what initiatives are working? Are you getting any actual traction in terms of volumes from things like Internet of Clean and robotics or is that just increasing the interest? Thank you.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Good to hear from you, George. Good question, again. The Product Care in North America would have been up if we would exclude voluntary rationalization of our portfolio. You know that I am keen in margin expansion and the quality of business and, as a result of that, we are leading there and being very forceful. The other thing that we have done is that in Latin American countries, starting with Mexico, we had a commodity business, which was really unprofitable and, therefore, we just \u2013 we did that out.","Having said that, we would have seen higher growth in volume in North America, should the electronic business be more positive. And actually it's been fairly negative when you look at the computers consumption, when you look at the \u2013 those kind of devices consumption, it's been fairly weak. On the positive, we're seeing a lot of momentum in 3PL and e-commerce, and we are introducing some very, very interesting solutions here, which make me very positive for the next 12 months.","On Diversey, I'm pretty happy of what I'm seeing, because the trend is a positive trend, and we're having nice volume in every single region. So volume growth is accelerating. We think we had a bad quarter for all kind of reasons at the beginning of the year in Canada. We're seeing a strong volume growth there. We're seeing very nice in the U.S. EMEA is doing much better and we're seeing volume growth there. And when I compare quarter one and quarter two, I'm just seeing a trend. So these are not businesses which turn around very quickly, because customer wins and the share of wallet at the customer is just a long-term process, but I'm positive.","So coming to the Internet of Clean, et cetera, Internet of Clean was a Change the Game initiative that we talked to you during our Analyst Day. These are not big products today. We are starting \u2013 we're having very interesting pilots with customers and things are moving favorably. But you're not going to see a huge swing all of a sudden out of this.","Intellibot, I can tell you how happy I am, I really am. We have seen a pickup in our machine ordering, pickup in our sales, and we are investing a lot. We're going to lose money in 2015 out of this Intellibot operations, because in fact we are accelerating our R&D and our commitment to that. So actually this is going to impact the second half of the year. But I'm very happy with that.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Ng with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Impressive quarter, congratulations on that front. You mentioned the contractual pass-through will kick in a little more fully in the back half for Food Care. Should we still expect positive pricing in that business and the amount of pricing you're seeing in Product Care? Is this a good level, especially with a potential uptick in the back half from a favorable mix?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, well, formula pricing is going to have a negative impact on our pricing in Food Care in the third quarter, there is no doubt about that. So I think it's important. We have had positive pricing in the U.S. specifically, because formula pricing is mostly in the U.S. or in North America, I should say. We have seen in Q1 and Q2 the price only just \u2013 the percentage increase come down because we have positive pricing \u2013 and I think it's going to continue to come down in the third quarter for the mechanical reason I just talked to you about.","With regards to Product Care, we are seeing \u2013 we're having price increases \u2013 but again, not as much. And the main reason I told you earlier is that when you have an environment where the resins don't go up, and when they have been going down, if you retain pricing, you have margin expansion, you don't have price.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. This is (46:42) for John McNulty. Just one question, on the cash flow front. What should we think about your ability to further improve working capital throughout the remainder of the year, through either efficiency improvement, inventory management, other things you could do?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, good morning and thank you. So in terms of the working capital, what we had previously discussed was that for the full year of 2015, we were expecting a little bit more than $100 million positive contribution from working capital and other. And so, you can think somewhere between probably $100 million to $120 million. It will depend on, obviously, our activity within Q4. That will drive receivables and payables, but somewhere between $100 million and $120 million for the full year.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. I was wondering if you could discuss the realization of the European price hikes you announced in the quarter, if you were satisfied with the progress there. And then if you could just talk generally about price-cost in Europe, maybe views on the second half? Price mix in Europe has been positive; that's lagged the company a little bit. Is that just a tilt towards Diversey or if could you just give some color there?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, yes, we announced a price increase. We have \u2013 and this is on the back of resin prices which have increased in March and April and May \u2013 and we have had favorable responses on this situation. And we don't think that there are going to be much more \u2013 or there's going to be price increases on olefins in the rest of the year. So just to cut the story short, yes, we have had price in EMEA as a result of oil price increases.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes, good morning, Jerome. Question I had for you all was, basically looking at the two things. One, the pace of the buybacks certainly in July was quite strong, and it looks like if you kept that pace, you would actually use up the authorization in about another eight or nine months. Now, I don't want to pin you down, but would you be disappointed that if you didn't have the opportunity to complete that buyback, say, by the end of next year? Is that a fair statement?","And then, if Carol could just talk a little bit about the amortization that's very elevated at Diversey, does that at some point start to come down? I know it's not a cash flow issue, but it would be an earnings issue as we look at the out-years?","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So, thank you, Chip. So with the share repurchase program, as you know, the program itself does not have an expiration date, and the board authorized the $1.5 billion share buyback program. We're active in the market. We have the 10b5 program. And I've discussed at the Analyst Day how a lot of companies think they can time these things and it doesn't necessarily prove out. So, we're just being very prudent in how we have structured the program, so they can operate automatically when we have our blackout period and things like that, and we'll just continue to operate that way. So, the market will determine whether that $1.5 billion in shares is used quicker or if it takes more time. That's really going to largely depend on a lot of the market dynamics.","And with respect to the amortization, we are \u2013 obviously, what you see with Diversey Care is the amortization of the intangibles that was acquired through the Diversey acquisition. And we will see a decrease in that as we go forward. But for example, if we look at the amortization of intangibles for 2014, it was approximately $120 million and for 2015, it's approximately $95 million. So we will continue to see that come down around that scale.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Mark Wilde. Please proceed.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah, Jerome, just curious, you're mostly focused on kind of taking the company ahead. I wonder if there are any remaining portfolio moves just in terms of cleanup. You have a lot of equity interests in different business. I think you've got some assets like small paper mills out in Pennsylvania. Any more moves in just sort of portfolio cleansing?","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","Actually, probably not. If we do things, they're going to be smaller ones or really non-core. So that's the way I'm thinking about it. It might be a product line that we believe is either distracting us or it might be a given little product in a given country. The challenge I'm putting to our division leaders is that when we have something that we don't believe we can fix and is distracting us is we should that action. And the reason is that we all know that non-profitable things or non-profitable businesses or product lines are in fact taking the bulk of our time.","Carol P. Lowe - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Mark, I'll add just one thing. You referenced that we have some equity investments. The company previously has had a variety of joint ventures, small in scale or some equity investments largely around specific types of innovation. And one thing, when Jerome joined the company and he really emphasized and we talked about it publicly is that our investments \u2013 we were going to make sure that we could realize a good return. And we went through a process of analyzing all of those investments and where we did not see opportunity for a fair return and we had been investing in those ventures sometimes three-plus years, we made decisions to exit. And we have exited substantially all of those equity investments that were not wholly-owned.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So the focus is on margin and profitable growth. That's where the focus is. We know that we can fix things. So priority one is to see whether a given product line in a given country is core or non-core. If it is non-core, it's got to be disproportionately profitable. And if it's core, we have proven to ourselves then we can fix things. And if after being fixed, they are still disproportionately less profitable then we take action.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Sure. Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my follow-on. I guess, Jerome, to the extent that you can in a public forum, can you size or provide a bit more qualitative commentary on what you're doing in 3PL and e-commerce in terms of what kind of impact that you have back half of 2015 and into 2016? Thank you.","Jerome A. Peribere - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, good question, and welcome back. Ken Chrisman has been very outspoken during our Analyst Day as to where he is taking this division. And we are intervening a lot on dim weights and we are intervening a lot on helping e-commerce companies and third-party logistics to be more productive. So, on dim weight, we have fabulous solutions to create value to third-party logistics and e-commerce companies in their fulfillment operations. And as a result of that \u2013 and by the way, stay tuned, because we are taking actions that we're going to publish soon on those things. But there is very key that for everybody to understand that dim weights is a problem to anybody which ships something, and we have the solutions to help them there. So is this an on\/off and immediate action? Not necessarily, but we're making progress every single day.","Lori C.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please begin.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or at the SEC's website at sec.gov.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP.

Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We will cover our second quarter and first half results, key drivers for the second half, and how we are executing on our strategy. We will also provide an update on our sale of Diversey to Bain, use of proceeds and our share buyback program.","And as we review our quarterly results and near-term business trends, you will see that our long-term profitable growth strategy is coming to fruition, presently led by volume growth. You are now seeing renewed top-line growth as a result of our Change the Game execution.","In Product Care, our stated strategy to disproportionally grow our e-Commerce and 3PL business and progressively transform it to automated fulfillment solutions that will over time give us equivalent margins to our industrial business.","In Food Care, we are benefiting from our focused efforts to deliver unique, differentiated, case-ready application that align with protein processes' productivity imperatives, and retailers' and consumers' demand for longer shelf life and waste reduction. Our execution on our growth initiatives will continue to gain momentum. We are making the right investment and taking the correct actions where needed to drive additional and sustainable EBITDA growth.","During our Analyst Day scheduled for the week of December 4, we will provide an update on our strategy and 2018 outlook and longer-term financial objectives. In reviewing our second quarter for continuing operations, sales of $1.1 billion were up 4% in constant dollars after delivering a 3% increase in the first quarter. Food Care sales were up 3% and Product Care sales were up 6%. The acceleration in both divisions was led by outstanding results in North America with growth of 9% in constant dollars on the heel of 6% growth in Q1. This is the highest level of growth we have delivered in North America since 2010.","Adjusted EBITDA of $196 million increased from $182 million in the first quarter. Our divisions performed in line with our expectations, particularly in light of higher raw material cost and increased freight surcharges. In Product Care, we were faced with increased cost of olefins, nylon, MDI and paper, and the price increases that we announced in the spring did not produce the yields that we were expecting; therefore, we announced a second price increase effective September 1.","Also, we have a temporary unfavorable mix impact in Product Care due to higher sales of utility products to our e-Commerce and fulfillment operations. With that said, I cannot be more pleased with the execution of our automated solutions portfolio and the value it is bringing to our customers. Sales already increased more than 10% in the first half and the pipeline continues to expand globally.","In Food Care, we continue to see increased market penetration for our proprietary case-ready solutions and we are capitalizing on the North American beef cycle. To be fully transparent, we have been surprised by the magnitude of the impact on our business from the beef inspection scandal in Brazil.","And as you all know, we have been faced with higher resin costs, which takes time to recover given our formula of pricing. We just started to see a turnaround in formulas late in the second quarter.","But for 2017, we are committed to achieving our financial objectives and expect sequential EBITDA growth in both divisions in Q3 and Q4. Our second half results will benefit from a combination of higher sales of our differentiated solutions, as well as our price and cost actions.","With regards to our Diversey. Our sales to Diversey to Bain is on track to close and we are committed to a successful separation. When we announced the sale in late March, we also increased our share buyback program to address the dilution of the transaction. Following our May 9 earnings call and through August 1, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $285 million using the combination of open market repurchases and accelerated share repurchase program.","We have approximately $1.9 billion remaining under our existing program and once the transaction closes, we will have more flexibility with share repurchases, targeted M&A opportunities and as previously discussed, we also plan to pay down our debts.","Let me now turn to slide 5 and briefly review our regional performance for Sealed Air for the second quarter. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales, and as I noted, delivered impressive growth of 9% in constant dollars.","Europe, Middle East, Africa, which accounted for 22% of our total net sales. And Food Care sales in EMEA declined 1% year-over-year, as positive sales trends in France, Italy and Spain, were offset by weakness in the UK, Russia and Germany.","Product Care was down 2%, primarily related to rationalization efforts in France and the softness in the industrial sector in the UK. Excluding these rationalization, Product Care sales in EMEA would have been down less than 1%, and this is, by the way, the last quarter that we will report an year-over-year impact from rationalization.","Asia Pacific represented 14% of net sales. In Food Care, APAC sales declined 7% due to the Australian beef market down cycle, which was partially offset by an increase of 11% in New Zealand and 6% in China. Product Care delivered double-digit growth in APAC, led by 15% growth in Japan, and 11% in China.","In Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, declined 4% in constant dollars, Food Care was badly hit by Brazil, and to a lesser extent the economic weakness in Argentina. On the contrary, Mexico was our fastest-growing country in LatAm with 9% growth.","Turning to slide 6, which highlights volume and price\/mix trends by division and by region. You can see that this slide \u2013 from this slide, that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the second quarter, led by 9% volume growth in North America.","Price\/mix was essentially neutral to our overall sales performance. In Food Care, I want to highlight that for the first time since the third quarter of 2015, North America delivered a favorable price\/mix due to the continued adoption of our case-ready platform and the timing of raw material cost pass-through. And in Product Care, unfavorable price\/mix in North America was partially offset by the positive impact of our rationalization on product mix in EMEA.","And now let's turn to slide 7 and review Food Care results in more detail. Food Care delivered $680 million in net sales in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of $146 million or 21.5% of net sales. As illustrated in the EBITDA bridge provided on this slide, higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative price\/mix and price\/cost spread.","Strength in North America was driven by improved protein production in all market segments led by the beef sector with a 5% increase in slaughter rate and the adoption of case-ready applications across all protein. And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, we expect North America to be our fastest-growing region, yet at a slightly more moderated pace.","Keep in mind that our second half is facing tougher comps as cattle production started its increase in the second half of last year. Therefore, the industry is forecasting production to be at a more measured rate of 3% to 4%. EMEA, which accounted for 22% of Food Care sales was essentially flat compared with last year as it follows a tough first quarter. Food Care equipment sales returned to growth one quarter earlier than anticipated and I would add that the pipeline for both materials and equipment is nicely improving. Market penetration for our case-ready solutions, including our Darfresh platform, ready meals and ovenables, which continue to increase. This is the primary driver for higher equipment sales and our anticipated improved performance in EMEA in the second half.","APAC accounts for 14% of Food Care with Australia and New Zealand accounting for close to 70% of our sales in this region. Beef production in Australia was down approximately 12% in the second quarter as cattle farmers continue to rebuilding their herds. We have easier comps heading to the second half, however, we are not anticipating growth in this region until late 2018.","Latin America represents the remaining 12% of sales with Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounting for approximately 75% of Food Care sales. Our business in Mexico increased 9% in constant dollars, as we continue to penetrate the market with our advanced solutions. Despite the current events in Brazil and the economic situation in Argentina, we continue to view LatAm as a region with significant growth potential, and as such, we recently closed the acquisition of Deltaplam, which is a $25 million net sales Brazilian manufacturer of flexible packaging. Deltaplam utilizes superior extrusion technology to create recyclable, high-value solutions and this acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America, expands our portfolio of consumer unit packaged solutions, and extends our reach into several new market segments.","For the full year of 2017, we expect Food Care to increase sales 3% in constant dollars led by North America and improving trends in EMEA. We expect sequential growth in EBITDA in Q3 and Q4, largely due to timing of our raw materials cost pass through.","Slide 8 highlights results for our Product Care division. Product Care net sales were $391 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $77 million or 19.7% of net sales. Similar to Food Care, you can see in the EBITDA bridge that higher volumes and cost management were offset by a negative mix and price cost spread.","North America and EMEA accounts from approximately 85% of Product Care sales. E-Commerce and fulfillment are our fastest growing sectors in both of these regions and we are starting to see a rebound in some areas with the industrial segments.","Sales in APAC were up 10% in constant dollars led by Japan and China, where we are experiencing increased demand for our differentiated solutions portfolio including Fill-Air inflatable and automated equipment. We are increasing our market presence in this region, and have expanded our local manufacturing capabilities to support that growth.","For the full-year 2017, we continue to anticipate top-line sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. We expect sequential EBITDA improvement in Q3 and Q4 as a result of cost management coupled with pricing actions. And as compared to last year, our third quarter is expected to be flat to down with year-on-year growth returning in the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2017, we expect adjusted EBITDA in Product Care to be essentially in line with 2016 as a result of segment mix and the timing of recovery of raw material cost.","Let me now pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and our outlook for 2017. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Jerome. Let's turn to slides 9 and 10 which provide the sales and EBITDA bridges for Q2 and the first half 2017. Jerome has provided comments on our sales trends in the quarter and first half of the year, so my comments will focus on the bottom of slide 9, which highlights our second quarter adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis.","Adjusted EBITDA was $196 million. Volume contributed $19 million in Q2, which was offset by unfavorable mix and price\/cost spread of $20 million. Operating expenses decreased $5 million and restructuring savings were $2 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Unallocated costs were $3 million in the second quarter 2017, as compared to $4 million in the second quarter 2016.","Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.35 in the second quarter compared to $0.37 in Q2 2016. Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q2 2017 was 39% compared to 32% in Q2 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter 2017 was impacted by our mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions.","On slide 10, we present our first half sales and EBITDA bridges. Higher volumes in the first half of the year were essentially offset by unfavorable mix and price\/cost spread.","On slide 11, free cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. For the six months ended June 30, consolidated free cash flow, excluding payments related to the sale of Diversey, was a source of cash of $93 million. CapEx was $93 million. Cash interest payments were $105 million and restructuring costs were $33 million.","Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $110 million. Payments related to the sale of Diversey were $45 million, of which $33 million relates to a cash tax payment that secured certain benefits, enabling us to divest Diversey in a tax-efficient manner. This cash tax payment was included in our growth to net proceeds calculation, which we estimated cash tax payments in the range of $250 million to $275 million.","Turning to our outlook on slide 12, we are on track to achieve approximately $4.3 billion in net sales or more than 3% constant dollar growth. This forecast assumed increases of 3% in Food Care and 3% to 4% in Product Care. We expect our top-line performance to be driven largely by volume in both divisions. 2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $825 million to $835 million as compared with our previous guidance of approximately $825 million.","Corporate expenses are now expected to be $125 million, which includes $20 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations. As a reminder, these unallocated costs consist of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that do not qualify for discontinued operations.","Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $190 million with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt in 2017. Depreciation and amortization is forecast at $160 million. We continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be 28% for the full-year 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.80 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $1.70.","Our adjusted earnings per share outlook is based on 193 million shares, which reflects the weighted average full-year effect of share repurchases through August 1. Currency is not expected to have a material impact on net sales, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share for the full-year 2017. Our major currency exposures include the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q2; Australian dollar, 5%; and the Mexican peso, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real were each approximately 3% of net sales.","Turning to slide 13, we will review our outlook for free cash flow. Our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $400 million. This forecast excludes cash payments related to the sale of Diversey. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, we started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which includes our full-year 2017 outlook from continuing operations plus $215 million from the first eight months of discontinued operations, assuming a September close.","We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs are estimated to be $50 million.","Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million, of which $165 million represents Sealed Air continuing operations. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected at $25 million in 2017, and it is included in the $175 million total CapEx estimate.","Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash of approximately $65 million. As you know, a large portion of our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to note that our third quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, November 8.","With that, Operator, can you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you all doing?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Good. How are you, Mehul?","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Why do you think the previous price increase didn't yield the amount it should have, and I guess what gives you confidence on your September 1 price increase that you've recently implemented?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Very good question. You can go and say competitive forces et cetera. I think that the more important thing was the importance of the price increases. We tend to talk about polyethylene, which year-to-date went up 7%. We are not so much open on the price increases on nylon, which were very, very hefty between the fourth quarter last year and now. About MDI for our polyurethane foams, which has doubled in China, for example, in the period of 12 months, and paper and for example corrugated OCC went up 79% since July of last year. So that was very hefty, very big. We tried to pass important price increases and some of that got passed, but not enough. So, this is not very different than what happens from time-to-time. We had that three years ago where we had to go back with this. We're going back and we are just going to execute that on September 1.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Jerome. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everyone. I hope you can hear me well.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes, George. Good morning.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Congratulations on the progress. I just wanted to piggyback on the question of pricing and margin conversion. So, Jerome, is it fair to say that in your view the pricing efforts, maybe not being where you had expected them to be, was more a function of \u2013 in terms of their conversion to margin, the pace of the increase in input costs, or in fact was it more competitive activity?","And as you looked overall at the quarter, you had very strong volume growth in North America, congratulations on that. We would have expected more conversion in margin. What were the keys in terms of margin conversion relative to volume? Was it really the pace of inputs? Was it competition? What would you single out? Thank you very much and good luck in the quarter.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, George. All in all, actually, I'm really happy with what's going on. We had a strategy, which is about differentiating our self from competition and introducing our Change the Game strategy. This is clearly ongoing because, actually, it shows in our product mix. New products don't necessarily have the margins that we'll have when they reach bigger volumes and things like this. New products introduction can be somewhat costly. But at the very same time, you're seeing this volume growth and these trends which are very, very different from what you have seen in the industry.","And as a result of that, you've got to ask yourself, what's going on? What is going on is that the evolution of our portfolio is ongoing and that we are passing our cost increases and this is something that we know how to do. And when we're not 100% successful, we just come back later on. And it's not so much about pricing of competition, it is about the execution on our strategy, some tactical things. And if we don't get it right, right away, we just come back.","The reality is that in Food Care, our case-ready applications are ongoing everywhere. This is not a North American phenomenon, and we're seeing this through our equipment sales. Our equipment sales are strong and our orders book is very strong. This is going to happen later in this year and this is also going to continue next year.","And what we're seeing there is that the \u2013 it's about replacement equipment and it's also about new installs. This is not in North America only. This is in North America as there is a need for automation and newer and more performing equipment.","This is the case in Latin America, which is making us also very positive about the fact that there are long-term strengths here to come. This is also in Australia and New Zealand. So, what you're seeing is our customer investing in new type of equipment. It can be Darfresh on Tray. It can be Darfresh VSP technology, et cetera, but his is a very strong trend.","What you're also seeing in Product Care is that we are going through a tremendous evolution of our portfolio and our segments there. E-commerce and 3PL is here to grow. It is for us a very important segment and we are seeing equipment introduction again all over the world. And we're placing equipment in Japan. You saw a tremendous growth in China, in North America. The orders book in Europe is also very strong. And this is something, which is a fundamental trend in our portfolio.","Short term, the numbers I gave you, 79% increase in the last 12 months on paper. MDI, 30% up in Europe, 2x in China versus same time last year.","Nylon doubling and things like this, almost, I think that our short-term headwinds, but we know how to deal with that. We have proven to you over the past few years that we deal properly and we pass our cost increases.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","George, is there a follow up.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No. We got two parts there. I appreciate it.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez from UBS. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Good morning to all.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","A quick one on Product Care. I mean, you've talked in the past, and I think you mentioned that today, shorter term, like lower margins in e-Commerce and 3PL versus the segment margin. How quickly you believe you can close that gap?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, the pace is going to depend on our placement of new equipment and our reducing manufacturing cost of those equipment as we produced \u2013 as we go to mass production. There is a trend in e-Commerce and this trend is that corrugated cardboard prices are going up dramatically. And that as a result of that you are going to see more and more pouchers, which are enabling lower dimension and weight costing for shipping and lower cost of packaging.","This is a trend, we have two very strong offering here. For boxes, our I-Pack and e-Cube product line improve dimensional weight costing. And our StealthWrap and FloWrap equipment and the generations to come, which we are going to present at Pack Expo later in the year are tremendous substitute for boxes.","So, we have a huge momentum in e-Commerce 3PL, and this is, therefore, accelerating our sales growth in Product Care. Yes we are because of the cost increases, we are having a slightly lower margins. But as I said, we're dealing with those.","So, how quickly? We're going to show you during our Investor Day week of December 4, we're going to show you our three-year targets and plan, and you will see that what I said earlier in my prepared remarks, with regards to margin in that segment, you will see that we intend to recoup and have similar margins than in the rest of the portfolio over the next three years.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citibank. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just following up on the previous question. The $20 million EBITDA hit you saw in the quarter from mix and price\/cost spread, is it possible at all to say, roughly, what portion of that was mix shift and what portion is price\/cost that, I guess, at some point, you might get recovered?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, we don't break out between mix and price\/cost spread. It's a combination of both, Anthony. But, we do expect, as Jerome has highlighted, to see improvement sequentially in our EBITDA growth as we move through the balance of the year. And we started to see the turn from the formula pricing for Food Care at the end of the second quarter, and will expect to have positive trends from that, obviously depending on how resins play out for the second half of the year and the price increases being implemented for the Product Care division will also favorably impact our improvement sequentially in our EBITDA margins as well as our overall EBITDA growth.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","We are in a specialty business. You don't shovel your price increase on to your customers. You collaboratively work to introduce those solutions and at the very same time you have to pass your costs. We understand that, and it's just a question of time.","It would have been faster if those cost increases would not have been that important. So, have we absorbed a little bit of those? Yes, we have. But our customers know that we are passing them. This is why we have announced our September 1 price increase, and this is \u2013 we have announced those in North America. We have announced those in Europe. So, it's ongoing.","In the end, we have a lot of momentum with our customers because they know that in both of those divisions, we are the innovator, and this is what allows us to work collaboratively, positively with them.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Anthony, do you have a follow-up question?","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Thanks for all the detail. Congrats on the progress here, so especially on the volume side. Just trying to understand the guidance for the rest of 2017. So, you increased the EBITDA range to $825 million to $835 million from $825 million, but you also lower the FX headwind to zero from $5 million. You had other lower costs as well in Q2. I'm just trying to understand, is the guidance bump from the lower FX headwind and lower stranded costs? Or are you actually more confident in the Food Care and Product Care segments?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, what you're seeing is that there are few bubbles in the air right now. The FX is more favorable than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Where is it going to be three or four months from now, I don't know. Just picked the euro. In January, the euro was at $1.03. It is at $1.18 today. And nobody would have thought in January that it would be at $1.18 today. So, I'm not going to go and anticipate, but at this point in time, there is a positive bubble in the air, which is related to currency and that's one thing we have as a possible positive.","As a possible negative, we're a little bit concerned with polyethylene prices. We were anticipating that they were going to start to come down in September. And right now, we have some producers who are already just talking about price increases on the heels of possible hurricane. I mean, this is the most fun thing that you can hear, but there's a little bit of momentum there. You have some producers who have announced price increases for July that did not happen. They've been announced for \u2013 they've been pushed to August. And then, you have some more announcement, which have been done for September. So, you've got some of those games going on right now.","But we are a bit concerned that as a potential negative, we would not have what we were expecting in terms of raw materials on polyethylene for September to December. So, that's why we're seeing that. And next to that, we're very determined to get our price increase through and we might suffer a little bit from volume in some more commoditized segments in there. So, that's what we're doing.","Overall, these are short-term tailwinds or headwinds, very short term. We believe that our fourth quarter is going to be very strong and the most important thing is to see that this Change the Game, which was in doubt in 2016 that we were believing was coming, is definitely coming. This is why we're having that growth momentum right now, which we didn't have in 2016 and which in general, the industry doesn't have.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question. Go ahead, Arun. Sorry about that. Go ahead. Operator, can you open up back the line or we'll bring him back after? Do you want to go to the next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Jerome, two questions. First is just aside from paying down debt and buying back shares to offset the dilution once the deal closes, what is your just overarching strategic plan for the new company? Do you eventually plan to grow by acquisition, or what exactly do you have in mind? Obviously, EBITDA over the last eight quarters or so has been kind of flat to down. It's just been hard to generate organic EBITDA growth. So, what do you have in mind longer term post the deal closing?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, we did not have growth in 2016, sales growth, and therefore, EBITDA. We are in transition, and we said that several years ago. There was a Get Fit and there was a Change the Game. It is very important to understand who we are. We're not a simple packaging company.","We are solutions driven, and our margins will expand as we expand the value of our solutions to our customers. That is very clear, and there is a fundamental mega trend in the way we're working with our customers. They respond, we are the very big player in the sectors of protein and in the sector of protective packaging through our solutions.","We are \u2013 that is where we're going. So, we're not going to only buy back share and pay down debt. We are starting to look at some potential acquisition targets, multiples are very high, generally speaking, acquisitions do not return shareholder value, traditionally or most of them don't, or the vast majority of acquisitions do not generate shareholder value in general, and when you look at the multiples right now, you have to be careful. This Deltaplam, very small acquisition, is a very good example of a small acquisition in a given country where we do believe that there is potential. It was the right time, at the right price with the right equipment and technology. They have fabulous equipment and that is going to be a very nice little acquisition. We are looking at some others.","At the very same time, you have to understand that we've been very, very busy with the separation of Diversey. Therefore, we're not going to rush into things right away. We are working diligently and with discipline on the next step. But, yeah, we are going to be doing acquisitions over time.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Jerome. And just one follow-up. You talked about acquisition multiples being quite high. I know you're buying back your stock just to offset dilution. But you guys are, call it, at 12 times, 13 times EBITDA once you get the proceeds. I mean, do you think your stock is undervalued here? And if so, can you explain why you think that?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Well, you're not going to take me there. Do I personally think our stock is undervalued? Well, looking at the Investor Day as it is coming in our numbers, so you will judge in December whether you think that our stock is overvalued or undervalued. I have my own opinion on those kind of things.","We are determined to become a value-add company to our customers with new solutions. We happen to invoice packaging, but our number one asset is to add value to our customers because of longer shelf life, because of the very differentiated equipment that we're bringing and with regards to protective and the e-Commerce and industrial, the dim weight cost increases are important and they become \u2013 as e-Commerce is growing very rapidly, you are seeing the absolute need of optimizing e-Commerce packaging and we are in a tremendous position to do that. So, we are specialty of specialty. This is the way you are going to see us over time.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning, thank you. Could you just I guess talk a little bit about the type of volumes that you are seeing on the industrial side of Product Care. I mean, are you seeing growth there or is it really mostly from the e-Commerce and fulfillment?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","We're seeing growth in industrial sector. I'm not going to tell you that we're seeing huge growth, but it has bottomed last year, and it is the second quarter where we're seeing some dollars and volume growth, we'd call that in the range of 2%, 2.5%, which is quite good. Not everywhere. It is country-by-country, but we're seeing, in China we're seeing industrial growth, in some West European countries we're seeing industrial growth, in the U.S. we're seeing a little bit of industrial growth, in the UK, we're not. So really, you read the GDP and you see what's going on, but we're doing quite well there.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Tyler, do you have a follow-up?","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah. I guess, Carol, just on the corporate expense. I think the previous targets were to get rid of the $40 million of stranded costs, eliminate 50% in two years. And then, on the unallocated was to eliminate by 2018. I guess, those unallocated a little bit lower. But has anything sort of materially changed with those targets?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","No. We're still on track for that. The $20 million unallocated that was revised down from $25 million should not have any negative impact on 2018. We are already starting activities to address the unallocated as well as stranded costs. So, we're confident that we'll be able to stay on plan, if not outperform what's been previously communicated.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of (48:11). Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","I just wanted to go back to Brazil. Did we actually get the volume decline or can you just give us a little more flavor on what happened in the quarter in Brazil? And then, secondly, I think you were embedding some recovery in the second half for Brazil, is that still the case? And if so, some idea of how much?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, in Brazil, you could see if you look at the detail, the charcoal consumption went down 11% in the second quarter and that local meat consumption is down about 20% in the second quarter as a result of the inspection scandal saga and the related items in the production of fresh red meat.","This has been much \u2013 the impact has been much bigger than anyone could anticipate. The exports have been impacted also. Our view is that this is temporary. We're seeing that it's stabilizing. We're seeing that you have equipment being sold and placed and ordered by red meat producers.","And we are \u2013 I was in Brazil three weeks ago and just talking to all of those customers and they believe that the slowed rates are going to start to increase sometime in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So, this is not a long-term trend. This is specific to Brazil given the scandals that have happened.","Then you look at Argentina. And Argentina is seeing its consumption go up by 2%, which is very little. And you see the exports going up nicely at increasing in year-to-date by 38% except that Argentina is not a big meat exporter anymore, it is the number 17 meat exporter. It is the 17th largest exporter of meat and much smaller than it was a decade ago. That is for Argentina and Brazil.","We're seeing some positives in other countries. Very strong business in Mexico where we have extraordinary position. I was there last week. I can assure you that the trends are very, very positive there. We think nice trends in the second quarter in Chile for fish production where we participate very nicely there.","So, all in all, total Latin America is negative as a result of the weight of Brazil, but we believe that this is temporary.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just had two questions. One following-up on the last one. Just wondering if you could parse out, if any, of the strength in the non-Brazil Food Care business you think might have been benefiting from some of the reduced exports out of Brazil? Is some of that had to come from other regions?","And then, as a second question, Jerome, just wondering if you could comment on the e-Commerce margins, been weak for a couple of quarters and I think a couple of people were alluding to it, but just wondering how you see the margins on some of the new product offerings? Can they be in that 20%-plus range that you've been in, in the past once they start to get a little bit more scale and maturity? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, starting with the export, yes, the U.S. is dramatically benefiting from beef exports. You saw what happened in the first quarter. If I remember well, the April exports were at over 30% growth out of the U.S. So, what Brazil did not export and given the negative cycle in Australia, the U.S. has been a huge winner in this. And you are seeing right now that prices of U.S. beef are very high, but these did not affect the exports, and exports have been freshened and frozen, and cooked beef for the month of June have been almost 12% higher than a year ago. So, this is very strong. It's positive also for us because all of that is packed with our bags, and we are really happy going to see what's going on there.","With regards to e-Commerce, yes, we have a product mix, very nice. We have segment mix, which at this point in time is negative. We made no mystery about that already last year. What we were not seeing is the growth that we think. What you have to understand is that we having position, we're building new business with our customers and what I talked about last quarter is something that is happening, which is that it takes time to go and sell equipment.","It is a capital spending for our customers. This is not a consumable. So, on one side, you have margin squeeze a little bit to the very strong and steep increases of raw materials, paper, polyethylene, nylon et cetera which are ingredients, which are raw materials for our mailers, for our phones, for our bubble wrap et cetera.","But we're going to get over that. And next to that you have this capital equipment. The very strong sign is that our sales of equipment in Product Care year-to-date are up 10% compared to last year knowing that we have some StealthWrap and FloWrap and also made its core view which were equipment were prototypes shown at Pack Expo last year. We're seeing a very nice momentum in there that's going to accelerate. So, we're producing a few of those machines. And when that accelerates also, we're going to see margin expansion.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Freuchtel from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","I think it would be helpful to better understand your intended pace of share repurchases versus other uses of capital. Following the completion of the Diversey Care divestiture, should we expect to see a larger purchase in September? Are there any limitations on repurchasing shares in 2017 aside from the size of your share repurchase program? And I think you touched on this, but how do you think about the trade-offs of mitigating near-term dilution through share repurchases versus creating shareholder values through other uses of capital? Thank you.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, Jason, I'll start and then Jerome may want to address the very last part of your question. But there's nothing that would restrict us from being very active in the market following the close of the Diversey transaction. We have communicated previously that it is our intent to address the dilution. It will take some time. It won't all be done by the end of 2017 and addressing that dilution includes not only the share buyback, but also improvement in our EBITDA as we move forward.","So, we do plan to be active in the market. We plan to continue to use a combination of tools such as OMR as well as the ASR as we move forward. We modeled the share price based on our strategic plans and working with the board, set levels of that share price that we feel is the fair value for that share buyback.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","And I made comments earlier about our discipline. In the years to come, we are going to be bigger through acquisitions also. We're not going to rush into it. We're going to make sure that we add shareholder value.","This is a fundamental approach of this management team and we pursue innovation and strategy execution along the lines that we have already announced. You are going to see during Investor Day early December, how disciplined we are and the importance of this innovation. These are going to be complemented by regional bolt-ons in very strategic places where we believe that we can add tremendous value to deploy our technology.","You are going to also see over time that we are going to reinforce those two divisions, and be very focused in making sure that we are the specialty of the specialty company that we say we are becoming, and that we have already announced that we are going to become as a result of our Change the Game (58:02)","We are not seeing ourselves as a just simple normal packaging company. We are solutions-driven, oriented there. Our automation is a big part of our offering with the razor\/razor blade and you're going to see more of that as the years are coming.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, that concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"18705":["Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February  9, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Amanda H.

This call is being recorded. Here in the call today, we have William V. Hickey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tod S. Christie, Treasurer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] And now, at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.","Amanda H. Butler","Thank you, and good morning, everyone.","Before we begin our call today, I'd like to remind you that the statements made during this call states management's outlook or predictions for the future, are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. And we encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call as well. Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors, and many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures which do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial table that we have included in our earnings release.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?","William V. Hickey","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. During today's call, I will discuss our 2011 earnings and our sales performance results. Tod will then provide more detail on our financial results, liquidity measures, key balance sheet items, and then we will highlight our 2011-2014 Integration and Optimization Program, which we noted in our earnings release earlier today. I will then discuss our outlook for 2012, and we will follow with questions from both the phone lines and from our webcast participants, who are invited to text in their questions. As our release included a fair amount of data and color, including the use of a standard or conventional adjusted EPS metric along with a cash EPS metric, we will try to keep our prepared remarks brief and move to our Q&A session promptly.","This morning, we recorded our legacy Sealed Air full year 2011 adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 per share, which represents a 6% increase over the $1.60 of adjusted EPS we achieved in 2010, and within our guidance range of $1.70 to $1.75 earnings per share. ","For the purposes of looking at the legacy Sealed Air results, we have excluded all of the impacts of the Diversey acquisition, which closed on October 3 of last year. Our legacy Sealed Air earnings per share results reflect solid performance in a challenging economic environment while we completed the Diversey acquisition and began the integration process in the fourth quarter. We attribute our legacy Sealed Air annual earnings growth to a number of factors, which include the steady focus we have maintained on our strategic growth programs, which held our volume performance above peer levels at a full-year volume growth rate of 2%, even as the global economic recovery slowed most notably in the second half of the year. Our strong R&D pipeline and the incremental launch of nearly 40 new products in 2011 resulted in a 200 basis point increase in the mix of new products as a percent of net sales, which now stands at 17%.","Additionally, the developing regions of the world provided good overall growth with full-year sales growth of 10% on a reported basis or 7% on a constant dollar basis. This growth has increased the developing regions' sales mix of the total company to 18% of consolidated net sales versus 16% in 2010. And as you'll remember, this is up from the very low teens a number of short years ago.","Thirdly, cost mitigation continued to be a core theme as we effectively managed inflationary pressures and raw materials with appropriate pricing actions and other operational initiatives. As a result, we recovered substantially all of our petrochemical base cost incurred in 2011 with a price\/mix performance of 3% or approximately $120 million of positive price variance in the year. We also continued to generate productivity benefits of approximately $30 million per year through our supply chain emphasis on continuing improvement and strategic procurement programs.  Tod will touch a little bit of this in more detail during his comments.","As a result, the combination of solid business model fundamentals, extreme strong team focus on our long-term strategic objectives, even while navigating challenging economic times, and effectively managing cost price spread to maximize profitability, these 3 factors have allowed us to continue to generate solid free cash flow and prepay our bank debt, all value-generating achievements that we intend to build upon in the year ahead.","Let me spend a few minutes discussing, specifically, the results and highlights of the fourth quarter. In early December, we provided a mid-quarter review of our constant dollar sales performance through the month of November. At that time, we indicated that we were seeing positive constant dollars sales growth in most businesses and most regions. However, rates of growth were generally slowing on a sequential basis, but nevertheless still tracking above our peer group. Our final fourth quarter constant dollar sales results generally held to the performance levels seen in mid-quarter, except in European, Middle East, and Africa, EMA region. However, we had challenging year-over-year volume growth comparisons in our Food Solutions and Food Packaging business where we realized high single-digit percent rate growth in the fourth quarter of 2010.","We also strategically balanced the price\/mix in our portfolio as we sought to recover residual resin cost, and opted to exit certain accounts in the quarter. Overall though, the EMA region, which represents about 37% of our sales mix, showed good resilience in the fourth quarter due to the overall defensive profile of our business. Most Sealed Air segments generated positive constant dollars sales except for Protective Packaging, and Diversey constant dollars sales were flat for the region in the quarter, if including Diversey in the year-over-year comparison. As Europe and EMA region is a concern to the investors due to the ongoing economic uncertainty over the financial issues in Greece and other parts of Europe, I'd like to point out that the EMA region on a pro forma region full year 2011 basis, including the results of Diversey, performed in a steady fashion, with combined company sales effectively flat compared to 2010. Today, Diversey represents approximately 55% of our EMA region sales, and this segment declined approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis, thus demonstrating its defensive profile. This slight decline was due to an estimated 2% constant dollar decline in institutional cleaning and laundry applications, which were partially offset by a 3% constant dollar increase in food and beverage end markets due to our ongoing growth in the beverage sector. This EMA Diversey trend was in line with third quarter performance results as weak economic conditions in the region have impacted institutional cleaning demand, and challenging cash and carry business, which uses big-box store outlets to sell consumer brand cleaning solutions to small business owners.","Now at this time, I'd like to pass the call to Tod Christie to discuss the fourth quarter financial results and the integration program in more detail.","Tod S. Christie","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional details on our fourth quarter results, and I'll also address key details of the balance sheet free cash flow and liquidity items as well as our integration and optimization plan.","As you've seen in our press release, our adjusted EBITDA was $245 million in the quarter, which was a $51 million increase over last year but less than we anticipated. Legacy Sealed Air's adjusted EBITDA was $198 million or 15.8% of net sales in the fourth quarter compared with $194 million or 16% last year.  ","As we've indicated previously, raw material costs peaked in the second quarter. Our prior pricing actions and moderating raw material costs in the latter half of the year combined to yield a favorable price cost spread of approximately $18 million in the fourth quarter. And in fact, we were able to recover about 80% of the increased raw material and freight costs that we absorbed for the full year. Raw material costs for our Diversey segment are subject to different market factors and peaked in the third quarter, remaining there through the remainder of the year, resulting in negative price cost spread and lower adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter than we originally anticipated. We expect that the effect of our pricing -- prior pricing actions throughout our business will carry over into 2012 and provide us with additional benefits in the first quarter.","Now I'll turn your attention to free cash flow and liquidity items. Our free cash flow was $354 million in 2011, above our target of $225 million to $275 million for the full year. Changes in accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable resulted in a net use of cash of $42 million for the year, as increases from business growth were partially offset by benefits from various working capital improvement initiatives throughout the company.","Cash and cash equivalents were $723 million at December 31, down $76 million from September 30, 2011. During the quarter, we used $33 million of cash to pay for acquisition and integration costs related to Diversey; pay dividends of $21 million; and pay $12 million for 2 small acquisitions. As of December 31, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.5 billion. Our net debt was $5.2 billion at December 31 after repaying $100 million of debt. We continue to target the use of a substantial majority of our free cash flow for debt repayment after providing for our dividend payment and restructuring obligations. And we are poised to pay the first quarter 2013 installment on our bank debt as we continue to target staying a year ahead on our bank loan repayments.","In summary, we remain well positioned to fund day-to-day operations of our new combined company, return cash to our shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend and prepay our outstanding term loans. As you may have noticed, approximately 10 days ago, the U.S. District Court of Delaware, in the W.R. Grace bankruptcy, denied all objections that had been filed and confirmed Grace's plan of reorganization in its entirety. While this is a very positive step, the District Court rulings remain subject to further appeals before W.R. Grace's plan of reorganization can become effective. ","Our integration teams have been working diligently on our integration and optimization program, which has been outlined in our press release. We now anticipate $100 million of annual cost synergies in 2013, which is twice our original estimate. These cost synergies are expected to be equally split between cost of sales and SG&A. We're continuing to focus on additional upside cost-saving opportunities and we will provide updates as the plan progresses. We also have a high level of activity and enthusiasm on the commercial side and our sales teams are making joint customer calls and responding to tenders as we work towards our revenue synergy targets.","And now I'll turn the call back to Bill to highlight our 2012 full year guidance.","William V. Hickey","Thanks, Tod. Let's look ahead to 2012.","The coming year, our management team and employees are focused on 3 key objectives for the year: one, achieving successful integration of Diversey to maximize our synergies and long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders; two, manage our own [ph]  business to maximize cash flow and reduce our debt; and three, continue to grow our business by serving customers globally with innovative solutions and expanding our reach in developing regions.","As you saw in our press release earlier today, we have provided EPS guidance to you in both a conventional adjusted EPS metric, which only excludes restructuring and onetime special items. In addition, we have provided an adjusted cash EPS metric, which we introduced in December. This metric additionally excludes the amortization of all intangibles, non-cash interest expense and non-cash taxes. We believe these 2 metrics present our financial results quite clearly and convey the strength of our operational performance and the strong cash-generating profile of our business, necessary metrics to measure our achievements to our key objectives.","We believe the successful execution of our objectives in 2012 will generate a conventional adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.60 per share, or to put those numbers on an adjusted cash EPS basis, of $2.10 to $2.20 per share. ","Based on the level of detail we have provided in our earnings release, I will not repeat each guidance point on this call, but we would like to highlight that we're anticipating approximately 4% to 5% constant dollar sales growth in 2012 from a pro forma 2011 sales baseline of $8.1 billion. We also are expecting approximately 2 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency translation, which results in approximately something less than a $200 million reduction in our top line. As a result, this translates into our outlined top line guidance range of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion in 2012. For reference points, we watched the euro go from about $1.41 per euro to about $1.31, and that difference is what I'm referring to when I address the impact of $200 million on the top line. We also are expecting key raw material input cost to rise on the average of low to mid single-digit range for the year. And we expect to continue to achieve positive price mix in 2012 and similar unit volume as we achieved, on average, in 2011.","Although we remain cautious about the macro economic conditions in Europe and the EMA region, our businesses are continuing to estimate positive growth due to a number of favorable Sealed Air trends including enhanced opportunities among food and beverage processors; global accounts; and with distributors within the institutional and laundry segment. Our expanded market reach through new distribution channels that we've mentioned earlier, such as Staples and Synthos, and through business partner relationships like the one we have with GE Water & Process Technology. Also, we're relying an existing strong sales momentum in the developing regions where we continue to expand our penetration with a more robust share infrastructure. We look to the strength of our new products across all these business segments, which we have the opportunity to further scale on a global basis and expand Sealed Air's presence.","And fourth, ongoing demand for protein in the developing regions of the world, as well as our processor customer demands for more efficient automated packaging solutions to lower their total cost. So although global meat production is expected to rise by only 1 to 2 percentage points in 2012, although actually declined by approximately 2 percentage points in the United States, we believe that automation, effective packaging and improved merchandising and convenience features on packaging, and a solid export market will continue to drive our sales going forward. Additionally, our global footprint positions us well for anticipated healthier Brazil and Australian markets in 2012, which will contribute growth to our food portfolio.  ","On a more specific basis, our Food Packaging business is expecting to achieve constant dollar sales growth in 2012, very similar to 2011, with greater strength in areas like Latin America and Asia-Pacific, on more favorable comparisons and rebounding industries in those parts of the world. ","Our Food Solutions business expects to achieve constant dollar growth rate above 2011 rates following the anniversary of the case raise switch [ph] by a major retailer, but also ongoing penetration among their growth programs in developing regions and our fluid-based packaging systems.","Among our Industrial Packaging business, we are expecting similar constant dollar rates as seen in 2011 due to ongoing strong penetration, adoption of new products, new channel partnerships and product development opportunities with Diversey. Our Diversey segment is expecting to achieve a top line growth rate in line with our consolidated target, which will be driven by ongoing developing region growth, new channel partners, scaling certain product lines globally, and achieving sale synergies with the Sealed Air teams.","The combination of mid single-digit constant dollar sales growth in 2012 with higher cost synergies contributed to -- is expected to contribute to a 2012 free cash flow estimate of approximately $450 million to $475 million, which we expect to allocate to our dividend payments, cash charges associated with restructuring and reducing our debt.  This morning, we targeted a year-end net debt reduction target of approximately $260 million in 2012, bringing our debt down to below $4.9 billion, a solid reduction towards our net debt reduction target of $4.5 billion by the end of 2013. ","As we saw on the fourth quarter, our portfolio of businesses are rather defensive and resilient, but we do face risks. For 2012, we estimate our risk to be volatility in raw material inflation; achieving sufficient benefits from pricing actions to recover raw material costs; operational efficiency during the integration process; and further fiscal or geopolitical challenges in Europe and the EMA region. Overall though, we feel confident in the factors we can control and continue to monitor conditions with contingency plans, if conditions merit, for those factors that we cannot control.","Lastly, I should note that our guidance range currently excludes the payment of the W.R. Grace settlement, as the exact timing of the settlement continues to be unknown. We have estimated that the payment of the settlement is expected to be accretive to adjusted EPS by approximately $0.13 per share annually following the payment date, under the assumption of using a substantial portion of our cash on hand to fund the payment.","Before moving to the Q&A session, I recognize that a key point of interest has been our 2013 objectives, as outlined in our June 2011 presentations during the time of the launch of our Diversey acquisition and announcement. Most notably, the 2013 objectives were targeted at $9 billion in sales revenue and $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Although we're in the process of analyzing any necessary recalibration to these objectives, changes in the foreign currency exchange rates alone in the past 8 months would reduce the $9 billion goal to approximately $8.6 billion today, which we feel is achievable by the end of 2013. Our initial adjusted EBITDA goal of $1.6 billion would also be impacted in a similar way by foreign exchange translation but also by the accounting adjustments we have harmonized in Diversey's version of adjusted EBITDA to Sealed Air's definition. These 2 adjustments would suggest an estimated recalibration of the adjusted EBITDA objective to be now in the $1.45 billion range.","And now, operator, I would now like to open the call for any questions from the participants and intermediately, we'll look through text questions from our webcast participants as well. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My 2 questions, Bill, Tod, is it possible at this juncture to broadly bracket the amount of cash outlay you expect around restructuring related to Diversey? And then the second question I had, guys, is as you look at how the year concluded and some of the risks, especially obviously, in Europe, how comfortable are you with the low end of your guidance and your ability, as you mentioned earlier, to bring in contingency plans to adjust if conditions warrant?","Tod S. Christie","George, this is Tod. I'll take the first question. So we recorded a $53 million charge for restructuring in the fourth quarter. We paid, in the quarter, $29 million of that so you can assume that the balance gets paid this year. And then we're also targeting additional payments this year as we record additional restructuring charges. So I would, just as kind of a broad estimate, I would say somewhere about $100 million this year in cash payments.","William V. Hickey","And George, go back to part 2 of your question or your second question. I'm still hopeful on Europe. I mean, we've been waiting for the Greek deal to happen any day, and any day is always tomorrow. But I've been to Europe twice now in the last 8 weeks. And there's a commitment on the part of the Europeans to pull this together. It's in everybody's interest to keep the euro whole, whether Greece stays in it or not. So I do think they will muddle their way through. And our contingency plans are basically to manage our cost and headcount very, very carefully.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So you remain comfortable then on the $1.40, even with Europe doing what it's doing?","William V. Hickey","I think we said $1.50.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Excuse me, $1.50. Pardon me.","William V. Hickey","Yes. I mean, there's always that macro risk. As I said in my comments, we're pretty comfortable with the risk we can control and the ones we can't, we'll watch carefully. And George, thanks for your comments on the mess. I mean, we're trying to feed all of you as much information as we can. So hopefully, we'll be able use it.","Operator","Your next question is Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to clarify, Bill, the $4.50 to $4.75 free cash flow. That excludes any cash restructuring charges?","William V. Hickey","That's right, Ghansham, that's our usual free cash flow calculation. So if you take out the $100 million I just mentioned in my response to George, that's really what we're looking at as the starting point for paying dividends and paying down debt.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And just to sort of clarify and establish a baseline for '12 also. What was the pro forma EBITDA for both legacy Sealed and Diversey in '11?","Tod S. Christie","Got that. Yes. So you're looking for the pieces?","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes.","William V. Hickey","While Tod is getting the pieces too, here, together. Just let me go back to Tod's earlier comment. If you take that cash flow number, and I think we were looking at, Tod said about $100 million to pay cash restructuring costs and about another $100 million in dividends. So that's how you get to the debt repayment number.","Tod S. Christie","Yes. I mean, the total on a pro forma basis for 2011 is sort of in the $1.60 billion, $1.70 billion range. The legacy Sealed Air is probably 70% of that.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And using all the -- I mean, it was great you guys gave us a lot parameters for '12. We get to about $1.16 billion at the midpoint. Does that seem reasonable for '12?","Tod S. Christie","I think that's probably a little on the low side.","William V. Hickey","Yes. Probably a little on the low side.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Philip Ng from Jefferies & Company.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The synergy number that you guys provided, it's more than double what you initially planned. Just want get some thoughts, what are some of the puts and takes, I guess, more on the positive side? And does that number include some of these opportunities you guys have talked about in the past, in terms of SKU rationalization, supply chain optimization?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, Phil, this is Tod. The initial targets that we put out there were based on what we knew in the early days. And now that we've had integration teams working on the opportunities and working together for several months, they've been able to uncover a number of additional opportunities. The initial guidance was based really just on SG&A and back-office type of costs. And as we've developed the model, we are now identifying cost in cost of goods, so things like supply chain optimization, which is new. So it's more in SG&A plus the addition of the manufacturing network.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But some of the stuff you guys have highlighted in the past about Diversey, how they wanted to reduce their SKU and supply chain optimization. Is that separate or is that now included with that $100-plus million number?","William V. Hickey","No, Philip, I think we said it in the press release, I think we said that the integration optimization program does not include the individual programs that Diversey had prior to the transaction. So that was their EPC and their SKU rationalization. Those are still standalone, as they were, that we told you about back in the summer.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And that's what I thought. I just wanted to verify that. And then the European Principal program, how should we think about the optioning going forward? I mean, I think it's mostly coming from the tax line, but just wanted some thoughts now for 2013.","William V. Hickey","Right. It's mostly the tax line. It's mostly the tax line, and it's about $30 million. Wait, Tod has a...","Tod S. Christie","Yes. We had talked about $30 million, probably back in the spring, and the project is still on target to go live in the second quarter of this year. So this year, we will be continuing to incur some costs to go live, which will begin to be offset by the benefits. That'll be a net cost this year, and that's contemplated in our guidance. For 2013, we're still expecting benefits but we expect them to be somewhat lower than we originally anticipated, in part because that $30 million number reflected an old euro to dollar exchange rate. And in part because European profitability is somewhat less than what it was back when we were talking about it in June.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So with kind of tax rate should we be thinking about for 2013, I mean, at this juncture?","Tod S. Christie","Overall company core tax rate should be 30% and trending lower over time as we're able to implement additional tax planning strategies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","You were giving some, Bill, some net debt numbers that, of course, include the W.R. Grace liability. But I believe, and just correct me, they do not though include the tax benefit that would come back to you once you make that payment.","William V. Hickey","Right. The net number we use, the $5.155 billion, is short-term debt, long-term debt, W.R. Grace settlement less cash. That's the $5.155 billion.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. So we should really think of the tax benefit coming back the other way is about $300 million, $400 million, right?","Tod S. Christie","Yes. That'll be a boost to cash flow when it happens.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And then the quick follow-up would be, you gave the adjusted cash EPS of $2.10 to $2.20. But just so I'm sure, if you also added in the impact of the interest you're incurring on the W.R. Grace monies that you don't pay out, then you would add $0.13 to that. In other words, that $2.10 to $2.20 does not include the $0.13 eventual benefit you get when W.R. Grace settled.","Tod S. Christie","No. We'll get the benefit in our conventional adjusted EPS. But the way the calculation works, because we add back non-cash interest in the adjusted cash EPS, so there's no bump to that number when we fund Grace.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. It's already in there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Bill, could you give us a feel, or Tod, on the order pattern on the Protective Packaging side during the quarter, and then since the end of the quarter? And linked to that, could you also give us a feel for how much you were helped by the strong e-commerce during the holidays?","William V. Hickey","I think I'll start with it and say that the trend for orders has been pretty consistent. I'll say Europe was a little softer at the end of the fourth quarter. But overall, Protective on a global basis was reasonably consistent and continuing into the first quarter, again, with continued -- a little bit, softness in Europe. The e-commerce was a real big boost in the fourth quarter. I would just, without mentioning the name of a large e-commerce company, but we were shipping 5 truckloads to them at one point just before the holidays.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And you have seen that, obviously, substantially declined at this particular stage, right?","William V. Hickey","Well, I call it seasonal. Rosemary, I guess I refer to -- if you look at our trends, just the seasonality of our business, the fourth quarter is 26% of the business and the first quarter is like 22%, 23%. So it's not really a decline, it's a seasonal adjustment.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, so that was my first question. And could you give us a feel for what is in the capital expenditure level that you have given us for 2012?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, Rosemary, the total is about 180 to 190. That includes about 20 related to the restructuring and integration programs. And the balance is kind of normal maintenance plus growth projects. So just kind of typical things that we see in our business all the time. The Diversey piece of that is relatively small because their business tends to have lower capital requirements than the legacy Sealed Air business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Bill, I think you gave us some color when you talked about these increased synergy targets and you talked about stuff in the Diversey side that you excluded from this. Do you do the same thing with the legacy Sealed Air? I mean, you have to have some ongoing sort of efficiency cost takeout programs on both sides of the business as just sort of an ongoing way to kind of tread water in a competitive market. Have you excluded that same kind of stuff on the Sealed Air side?","William V. Hickey","Yes. What we basically have communicated to investors prior to the end of the fourth quarter in terms of programs that either Sealed Air was doing or Diversey was doing, those remained separate. In fact, within Sealed Air we've actually set up an IMO, an integration management office, which is going to be tracking -- in fact, it's already started, tracking the new integration and optimization program as a separate component from the existing cost-reduction and savings programs of the legacy companies.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And just as a follow-on, you talked about having a lot of joint sales teams out on the road. Have you had any significant wins at this point? If you couldn't identify the wins, could you give us like the size of any wins that you might have had?","William V. Hickey","Yes. I think you heard me, but I probably said end of the fourth quarter. We've already closed, I think it was 4 or 5 accounts. It's less than $10 million so far. Well, actually, I feel pretty good about one we got yesterday. We got a water account through the GE partnership which we took in Latin America, which was really our first win on the water treatment side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First of all, when you reported the third quarter, you talked about an adjusted EBITDA number for the fourth quarter of $335 million to $345 million. And then today's number was lower than that. Is that an apples-to-apples comparison, what you reported today, relative to what you provided as your outlook for the fourth quarter when you had the third quarter call?","William V. Hickey","Tod's got the reconciliation, I'll let him handle that.","Tod S. Christie","Yes. So Alex, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. And we broached that subject first when we filed our 8-K\/A in December. So there were a couple of changes that we made on the Diversey side relative to dosing and dispensing equipment where we aligned their policy for accounting for that with ours, as well as the cash-settled SARS, or stock appreciation rights. So with that adjustment, that brought down the Diversey portion of the target. Staying on the Diversey side, there was some impact during the quarter from lower sales volumes. And we mentioned, in some of our prepared remarks, that the raw material inflation was higher than originally anticipated during the quarter. So those were the factors on the Sealed Air side. On the Diversey side -- I'm sorry, I got them flip-flopped -- on the Sealed Air side of the business, it was a combination of lower volumes and mix that led to slightly lower EBITDA for the quarter. And then the third element was the foreign exchange losses related to the Diversey transaction that were about $19 million in the quarter. So a combination of change in accounting definition, some lower volumes and higher costs and the onetime non-cash FX losses.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Tod. And the other question I had, on the restructuring cost, you've talked about $100 million in '12. Do you have a sense of what you expect those to run beyond 2012?","Tod S. Christie","Yes. The $100 million was our rough estimate of the cash out this year. And the total cost that we've identified is about $165 million to $185 million. So that's the P&L cost, of which $53 million we recorded in the fourth quarter. The bulk of the rest of it, we expect to record this year, and then there'll be some trailing cost beyond that.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions for you. First, and Bill, I appreciate the color along the way. I'm just a little confused with one part. As I'm comparing your 10\/21 to 11\/31, so October, November where you were with kind of you finished the year. It would appear as though Food Solutions, Protective Packaging, Diversey, each must have fell off pretty sharply in December. In other words, Protective Packaging, you're up 6% through those first 2 to 3 months and then finished at 4%. Diversey, you were flat to up 1%, you were thinking. You finished down. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, was December appreciably different in some of those businesses? And then what is your assumption -- I'll let that be my second part, to get to an assumption as to how we move forward. So the business trajectory, December versus what you saw earlier in the quarter.","William V. Hickey","Right. I'm looking, if I look at the ones you mentioned, Food Solutions was plus 7%, then plus 4%, so it was down 3%. And if you look at it, really, North America, Europe were really plus 5% of those numbers. And they came in at plus 2%. So most of the shortfall in Food Solutions was North America and Europe, primarily in Europe, where I think we really saw the southern part of Europe drop off pretty well in terms of Food. Interestingly enough, I was talking to the head of one of the supermarket chains who has been in business for 28 years. He said it's the first time year-over-year there's been a decline in food sales, which is a really remarkable statistic in Europe, and most of that happened at the end of the year. The other is there wasn't a real holiday season. There wasn't a lot of enthusiasm in Europe coming December. And remember, we were still -- Europe was really -- particularly in the South, the Italians, the Spanish, the Greeks, and we even saw France. France is very likely in a recession or just tipped over into it. So Europe is pretty much the culprit for both Food Solutions and Protective in the month of December, at the end of the quarter.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess where I'm kind of thinking about this is I realize we get changes between -- as we're looking at a constant dollar and as we're looking at the price\/mix component. But from Tod's earlier comments that you had recovered about 80% of the inflation components, I'm assuming that you'll get the other 20% next year. So if we take price\/mix out of the equation, what does this imply? What have you embedded into your assumptions for these different businesses, for just a volume basis for 2012? So in other words, Food Packaging Solutions, Protective, Diversey. What are you anticipating your core volume levels to be for '12?","William V. Hickey","Okay. What we are assuming, in terms of the core volume levels for '12, I think what we said in my comments that I said earlier, reasonably in line with 2011 full-year actuals -- which overall is in the 2 percentage range in terms of volume, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","I guess the first question would be on Diversey, if you could quantify the price cost headwind in the fourth quarter. And it also sounds like it's a bit of a steeper headwind than you'd originally anticipated, and if you could give us detail around that, what you're seeing there,  and if you're caught up.","William V. Hickey","Okay. I just do have just a -- just looking at Diversey's kind of fourth quarter is what you're looking at, Al? Are you looking at the full year?","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","I'm looking at the fourth quarter. It seems like there may have been a pretty decent size price cost headwind in the fourth quarter of '11. And I just wanted to see if you could quantify maybe what that was for us, one. And two, I think versus your earlier expectations, it sounds like this headwind, this price cost, is certainly worse than your initial expectations. And why is that? Is it tougher in terms of getting the pricing through? Is it the raw materials that are higher than you thought? And at this stage, are you caught up to it right now as you're in the first quarter?","William V. Hickey","Yes, okay. Let me just say that the raw material cost in the fourth quarter in Diversey was up around $21 million. And if you look at the net of what they've been able to recover with the composite cost and mix, it ends up being about $13 million behind, exiting the fourth quarter. We really thought we'd be closer to catching up at the exit rate. It's a term the Diversey people use in terms of how they manage their price\/mix. Their exit rate for the fourth quarter was planned to be 0. It actually came in at a minus 13. And I think that we will recover the 13. There are early signs of its coming back again in 2012. But if I look at Diversey's sort of overall top line performance for the fourth quarter, their sales were down about 1%. That represented kind of a volume impact of about minus 3 and a price impact of plus 2 -- plus 2.4, as it actually turned out to be. So there's recovery in price, but not enough to recover all of the cost. And a lot of their pricing is on a contract basis,  and so they really have to go through the contract price adjustments.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And I missed -- now so there's still a headwind the first quarter we should expect? I mean, when do you catch up to this?","William V. Hickey","Well, let's just say we are entering the first quarter $13 million behind. That's probably the best I can say right now.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then secondly, on the cost savings, the $50 million this year. Can you help us with the ramp there? What's the run rate that you've realize thus far? How does this ramp throughout the year? Is it linear? Is it back end-loaded?","William V. Hickey","Tod may have a good answer on that. But subject to Tod jumping in here, I think what our integration group has come up with, there's about $20 million already saved, so to speak. That'll run for at least 11 months. It's already achieved, based on what we did in the fourth quarter of last year. I'll let Tod comment further on that.","Tod S. Christie","Yes. We have, as Bill said, about $20 million already done and locked down. The balance will, I would say -- there'll be more benefits in the latter part of the year as we are ramping up from 50 this year to 100 next year. So I think you'll see sequential improvement over the course of the year.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And there's not going to be any offsetting cost? So the $20 million run rate, we should see all of that in the first quarter? There's not any extra cost in realizing any of that, that's hitting, are there?","Tod S. Christie","Yes. I mean, there's some of the cost that we already recorded in the fourth quarter. And I expect we'll take additional charges this year. But no, it's not anything more than what's already been disclosed in the press release.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Gazerano [ph] from Miznix [ph].","Unknown Analyst","A couple of, I think, quick questions, the first being you provided -- for 2012, you provided percentages for cost of goods sold in SG&A. I just want to confirm that the restructuring charges that you've discussed are not included in those percentages.","Tod S. Christie","Yes, that's right. So if you look at the -- let me just go to that page. Yes, that's right. That's just our normal expected run rate on those charges.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then you spoke about a net debt target for 2013 of $4.5 billion. Does that include the Grace settlement, because you had mentioned that there should be some cash benefit. So if we look at the $4.5 billion, should we then assume that it's \"if\" and when the Grace settles, then it could potentially be lower?","Tod S. Christie","It actually doesn't have a really significant impact on the net debt target because we expect to use mostly cash to fund the settlement. And if you look at our balance sheet at the end of the year, we had $723 million of cash. And I believe the Grace liability, with the accrued interest, was something like $830 million. So there will be some incremental borrowing that we would need to do on a short-term basis to assist with the funding. And so to the extent that we increase borrowing to do that, then we would likewise decrease it with the proceeds from the cash tax benefits. So the $4.5 billion is a target that we have without the Grace settlement, and there might be some incremental benefit to that but it wouldn't be huge.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then the last question is, you've just mentioned that Diversey is mostly a contractual business and that the pricing was up 2% in the fourth quarter. But as those contracts reprice, shall we expect declining prices throughout 2012?","William V. Hickey","No. We're looking at increasing prices in 2012.","William V. Hickey","Operator, let me take some of the text questions that have come before we go back around and take the second round from people on the phone. ","First question that came in on the webcast was, \"Would you please give us the split between Europe, Mideast, Africa, between Diversey and legacy businesses?\" If I look at what we classify as EMA, about 55% of that business represents the legacy Diversey business -- 58% the legacy Diversey business; about 13% of it represents the core Sealed Air Protective Packaging business; and about 13% of it represents the core Food Packaging business; and 12% represents the core Food Solutions business; and there's about 4% Other, which is primarily our medical business. So I hope that was what you were looking for in terms of how the EMA mix splits up among the company. ","The second question on the webcast, \"Tax refund expected in 2013 if W.R. Grace is settled this year. Still plan to use the proceeds to repay bonds that come due in 2013?\" If Grace is settled this year and Sealed Air makes the payment to the trust funds as required in the settlement agreement in 2012, we should expect to get the tax refund in 2013, in which case, we would use that to repay debt. I think that answers that question. ","The third question is, \"Please detail charges, operating income and EBITDA for Diversey in Q4 and for 2012.\" I'll let Tod handle that part of it. I know he's got part of it right here in front of him. Tod?","Tod S. Christie","Yes. I'm just pulling out -- so Diversey EBITDA in the fourth quarter, on an adjusted basis, was in the sort of $65 million to $70 million range. And then the operating income would be slightly below that, taking out the P&A  [ph] . 2012, we haven't separately provided guidance for Diversey on either of those metrics.","William V. Hickey","Okay. Can we go back, operator, and take a second round on the phone here?","Operator","Your next question comes from a follow-up of George Staphos from Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bill, Tod, looking back over time, when Sealed Air has had the need to further increase its free cash flow, it has shown a pretty good ability to pull down capital spending fairly quickly. And we also have the context, I think you said earlier at one point, during 2011, that one of your goals was to, I think you said, \"Passionately pay down debt.\" And so I guess considering both of those points, if you agree with the premise of the prior one, what flexibility do you think you have to -- while achieving all your growth goals and objectives for Diversey and the business, perhaps pull down that capital spending from what you've already guided to. What's the flexibility you think you have there?","William V. Hickey","George, you know we're pretty capable of managing capital down. So that remains part of our contingency if we need to.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Would there be anything -- you mentioned there would be a contingency. If you could talk to it, what would perhaps not be spent behind from a capital standpoint? Well, I think [ph] you'd like to. If you needed to bring down the capital spending in 2012, what would be the first thing that perhaps might go?","William V. Hickey","I don't know, that's a tough call, George. There's no major investments in 2012. I say there is one. I think we mentioned to you last year, we acquired a new factory in Brazil, and building that out this year is part of that number. I mean, I think long-term interest of the business to build out that factory in Brazil is kind of the right thing to do. As a contingency, I'd probably continue forward with that project but cut back on some of the smaller ones.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The other question I had and I'll turn it over. We can pretty much back into your EBITDA guidance this year based on the guidance you gave overall for the business, and you provided earlier a debt pay-down target for us. Should we assume that these are the targets that you will see incentive compensation for the organization based around? Or could the targets vary from what we've seen provided in the release and results today?","William V. Hickey","Well, yes. I mean, George, one, I can't speak for the board, who has that on their agenda to address. But I can pretty confidently say it won't be any less than those.","Operator","You also have a follow-up question from Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Bill, could you touch on the mix shift in Food Packaging? If you exclude the business that you had lost last year, and which I guess we have now anniversary-ed, is that a permanent shift outside of that particular item or do you think that, as the economy picks up, customers will go back to higher-margin, higher-price products?","William V. Hickey","Yes. I think, Rosemary, one of the shifts is the equipment side of our business was up quite a bit in 2011, which is always a good sign, especially in a challenging economy if customers are willing to invest in equipment. So our equipment sales are up. Our equipment sales are at very modest margins because we want to get the razor in the customers' hands so they can use the razor blades. So the equipment sales being up is an unfavorable mix for profitability, but does bode well for future sales. On the other side, some of the shrink bag sales are down, they're down a little bit. And that's due to some changes in customer use as well as an absolute decline in the number of animals processed. I think I commented earlier that meat production in the United States is down 1.1% for the full year 2011. So that's a factor. So you've got equipment going up at a lower margin and shrink bag sales going down at a higher margin.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay, that is helpful. And if I may, could you give us a better feel for what those 2 small acquisitions are that you mentioned?","William V. Hickey","Yes. One was an automated packaging machine for meat. And the other one was a small medical one where we actually put a small medical plant in Costa Rica, to take advantage of a lot of our medical customers who have moved operations down there. And it's much more efficient and cost effective to serve them locally than to ship product down from the U.S.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Do you see that medical business really growing going forward?","William V. Hickey","It's growing slowly, but it's growing.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","You're planning on keeping it?","William V. Hickey","We haven't made that decision yet. Haven't made any of those decisions yet, Rosemary.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. That would imply to the entire Other category unless something is about to kind of fly out the door?","William V. Hickey","Okay. All I can say is stay tuned. Well, we've got 3 questions up there, operator. Let's take those 3 and be done. So would you take the next one?","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess I wanted to understand as well. I'm looking at your integration optimization update. So it looks like you had an extra $60 million to $75 million that you are anticipating in that '12, '13, '14 timeframe -- or mostly '13, '14 timeframe. When I look at the cost associated with that, the $165 million to $185 million for charges, and then incremental $40 million to $54 million for CapEx, I'm assuming that, on the restructuring side, those will all be cash charges?","William V. Hickey","Yes. They'll be substantially cash charges. Most of it is employee severance, and depending on the part of the world you're in, employee severance in Europe tends to be quite high and the U.S. tends to be more modest. So it ends up being an average of about 1.5-year payback.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, I guess where I'm going with this is, if I add these, and I think about the savings and I think about the total cost including the CapEx -- and I kind of get to that, if you have $60 million to $75 million of savings and the total op being in the low 2s that this is kind of 3- to 4-year payback for the whole project. Am I thinking about that the right way?","Tod S. Christie","I'm not sure you're picking up all the savings, because we\u2019re looking at total savings annualized by the end of the program of $110 million to $115 million.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I apologize, Tod. I was considering this is incremental, right? So the incremental part, the CapEx and the new charges associated, just attaching that to the incremental part. Is that maybe an incorrect assumption?","Tod S. Christie","Well, there were charges associated with the first $50 million that we identified as well. So now it's all bundled together. So total program, $110 million to $115 million in benefits; $165 million to $185 million of P&L charges; and another $40 million to $50 million of CapEx.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I apologize, I was assuming that all of the new integration and optimization program was -- I was just assuming an increment fund [ph]. Okay, that's helpful.","Operator","And another follow-up question from the line of Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just on the sales force of legacy Sealed Air and Diversey. I just wanted to get your thoughts on integration, if you keep them separate, how you're thinking about that?","William V. Hickey","Yes. But you remind me of something about which I did want to say, is that although we're going through this integration optimization process, we're not reducing the number of salespeople. We're actually putting additional salespeople in the field. And we will actually have -- I think you saw our earlier announcement, we'll have basically 3 sales forces. I mean, because we'll have 3 businesses, the core Protective Packaging business, which we organize now was as a business within Sealed Air. They will continue to call on the industrial packaging customers. You will have the legacy Diversey, excluding the food and beverage piece of it. They will call on the hotel, hospitality, lodging chains. They will still do that as they had before. The integration really comes in the food side, on the food and beverage component, where we're combining the Sealed Air food sales and technical service people with the Diversey food and beverage sales and service. That integration has occurred. They've had joint training. They've been cross-trained on each other's products. There's a couple of meetings coming up the next couple of weeks and they will call on customers collectively.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And how has been the initial customer feedback on this?","William V. Hickey","Well, I said, as Amanda said earlier, with only a couple of months behind us, we've got probably sales under $10 million, 4 or 5 accounts and a fair number in the pipeline.","Operator","Your last question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the one hand, if we look at the December trajectory, would it be fair to assume that thus far, first quarter volumes are negative or, at best, flat? And is that embedded in your guidance? And then the second question, Bill, bigger picture. Over the last month or so, there had been a couple of people added your board who bring a great amount of experience and very good background. How do you see them being helpful to Sealed Air and its development over the next couple of years?","William V. Hickey","Yes. Okay, let me say that our January numbers are slightly up. I would say slightly up, it's been a slower start to the year, which you would expect after December. But again, the first quarter tends to be our slowest quarter. And as far as our new directors, I mean, they're real quality people, good experience. One from a general industrial background and the other with specific knowledge of the packaging industry, have got good experience, good credentials and I think will be an asset to the Sealed Air board. So I look forward to working with them.","Okay. With that operator, that's all the time we have, and I'd like to thank everyone for your participation in the call. I'd like to extend my thanks to the customers, employees, shareholders, and partners for helping us through a challenging but very exciting year, which ultimately transformed our organization with the addition of Diversey. I'm really proud of the hard work and achievements of our team in a very, very short period of time, our ability to stay focused on our customers\u2019 needs and the exciting opportunities ahead. I believe our combined efforts will result in ongoing and continuous improvements, stronger cash flows, further reduction in debt, all of which will enhance our earnings and shareholder value. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Chantilly and I will be your facilitator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you and good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide discussion. This presentation can be found on today\u2019s webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com. I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management\u2019s outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies in this call.","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Included in today\u2019s presentation on Slide 3, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complement some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation.","Now, I will turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome Peribere","Thank you, Lori and good morning everyone. I am sure that you have the time to review our second quarter earnings results and I will keep my comments brief and then pass the call on to Carol Lowe, our CFO; and Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of our Diversey Care division to provide a more detailed review of our second quarter performance and full year outlook.","Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations in each of our three divisions. We knew from the onset of the year that our growth in the first half would be muted. Food Care, Diversey Care and Product Care capitalized on growth opportunities in targeted countries and end markets, which offset other areas challenged by economic uncertainties, political unrest and a weak industrial environment. Overall, I am pleased with our adjusted EBITDA results of $306 million or 17.7% of net sales, which includes about $7 million of reimbursement related to environmental expenses on a slight increase in organic net sales.","Excluding this reimbursement, we had a very solid adjusted EBITDA margin performance of over 17% of sales. Product Care delivered over 21% margin, Food Care over 20%, and for the first time Diversey Care delivered 15% margin, excluding the environmental reimbursements. As we look to the second half and as previously communicated, we expect stronger performance primarily driven by volume acceleration. In Food Care, the operation rate continues to penetrate the market in Europe and we are in successful trials with two large retailers in North America. Diversey Care is enjoying new customer wins across its portfolio and our robotics startup, Intellibot, delivered record sales in May and June. In Product Care, our innovation pipeline and customer inflows are building as we prepare for a seasonally strong year end. This momentum, coupled with an improved protein market and accelerated growth in e-commerce and fulfillment, gives us the confidence in our second half growth trajectory.","For full year, our outlook is within the range of our previously provided guidance. Currency headwinds are not as high as we anticipated, but this benefit is being offset by our assumptions on resin cost and related impact on Food Care\u2019s formula pricing. Additionally, we anticipate the recent geopolitical events in Europe and the Middle East to have an impact on our business in the coming months.","Overall, our strategy is clearly working. Our market differentiation of revolutionary innovation is gaining significant traction in each of our divisions. In Food Care, customer interest continues to increase for our next generation target technology, Optidur. Diversey Care\u2019s disruptive and innovative technology, including the Internet of Things platform and digitally enabled solutions, are increasing our sales opportunities in a meaningful way. In May, we received a top innovation award at the ISSA\/Interclean Trade Show in Amsterdam. And Product Care has reshaped its entire portfolio and go-to-market strategy with dimensional ways, fulfillment velocity and consumer experience solutions. I strongly encourage all of you to attend two upcoming tradeshows: the ISSA\/Interclean in late October and Pack Expo in early November, both of which are being held in Chicago. At Pack Expo, Product Care will showcase more commercialized innovation that they ever had in the history of Sealed Air.","So with that said, let me now pass the call on to Carol and Ilham to get into more details by division and our outlook and then we will answer any questions that you may have. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 5 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the second quarter. Let me start with EMEA, where we had 2.5% organic growth and positive sales across our three divisions. Food Care sales increased 3%, Diversey Care increased 1% and Product Care increased 5%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by double-digit growth in Russia and high single-digit growth in Spain and Holland. We also experienced positive sales in Germany and Sweden. Asia-Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars. India was up 12% led by double-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. In China, Diversey Care delivered high single-digit growth and Product Care\u2019s business returned to growth in the quarter. Our largest markets in Asia-Pacific are Australia and New Zealand. And combined, they account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales.","In Food Care, sales in Australia and New Zealand were essentially flat compared to last year. In Australia, adoption of our advanced product portfolio and new customer wins are helping to offset the double-digit declines in slaughter rate and the export of live animals. In New Zealand, our business continues to be impacted by the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 11%, which translates into constant dollar growth of 8%. Despite the current environment in Latin America, Food Care experienced positive sales growth in Brazil and Mexico on an as-reported basis. This translates into nearly 20% growth in both countries on a constant dollar basis. Brazil and Mexico each accounted for approximately 4% of Food Care sales.","Let\u2019s move to Slide 6 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America sales were down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price mix of 3% partially offset by 1% volume growth. Food Care delivered healthy volume growth of 3%. This was more than offset by unfavorable formula pass-throughs. Diversey Care\u2019s North America business returned to growth in the second quarter with positive price mix and volume trends. Product Care\u2019s volume and product mix were negatively impacted by the ongoing weakness in the industrial market, particularly in manufacturing and electronics. Volume was also impacted by our rationalization efforts. Excluding rationalization, volume would have been positive in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 7, let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales, you can see that we delivered $1.7 billion. Volume contributed $9 million to top line growth and favorable price mix contributed $7 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $59 million and the impact from divestitures was $15 million.","On Slide 8, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $306 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price cost spread was $9 million favorable and positive volume contributed $4 million. We had $9 million in restructuring savings. Operating expenses of $12 million is net of the $7 million environmental reimbursement Jerome mentioned in his comments earlier. Salary and wage inflation of $17 million, currency was negative $9 million and divestitures were $3 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 in the second quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 29%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%.","Let me now turn the call over to Ilham to go through our results by division. Ilham?","Ilham Kadri","Thank you, Carol. Slide 9 highlights the results of our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter. We had positive sales growth in constant dollars in all regions. Asia Pacific was our fastest growing region with 7% constant dollar sales growth. In North America and Europe, constant dollar sales were at 3% and 2.4%, respectively. If you look at our adjusted EBITDA excluding the environmental reimbursement, we delivered $80 million or 15% of net sales. Volume, pricing and cost management all contributed to our strong EBITDA performance. It\u2019s worth noting that in the last 2.5 years, with the exception of one quarter, we delivered positive constant dollar sales and adjusted EBITDA growth every quarter.","I am particularly proud of the performance in North America and Europe over this time period. Remember that when we reorganized this business back in 2013, both Europe and North America had many years of declining sales and deteriorating margins, whereas Middle East, Africa and Latin America increased sales on a constant dollar basis this quarter, we are seeing a slowdown in our business due to political unrest in the Middle East and economic weakness in Argentina. Middle East, Africa and Latin America combined represents 15% of our sales. Looking ahead, we are confident the momentum in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific will continue. We are rolling out new customers and adding to our list of strategic wins across all sectors, including facility management, retail and healthcare sectors.","Customer feedback on our robotics and Internet of Things platform has been extremely positive and as a result we are accelerating our go-to-market strategy. For the full year, we expect constant dollar adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. The third quarter will experience a decline versus quarter two as we step up our implementation of new sites related to recent customer wins and the significant slowdown in hospitality in Middle East, Africa. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be stronger given the timing of the new customer rollouts and product and regional mix heading into year end.","Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 10 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 1% on an organic basis driven by a combination of higher volume and favorable price mix. By region, Latin America was up 11% and EMEA increased 3%. Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged and North America declined 3%. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million or 20.3% of net sales. Positive volume in North America and EMEA is largely a result of our case ready platform, including Darfresh on Tray. Also our next-generation barrier technology, Optidure is gaining traction with successful trials in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. In Hygiene, we continued to improve both sales trends and profitability. We are also investing in new solutions, including our recent acquisition of Finland based TTS-Ciptec, a leading, cleaning place systems optimization company. This acquisition complements our expertise in remote monitoring and data analytics and enhances our knowledge based service offering.","In the second half of the year, Food Care organic sales growth is expected to accelerate, primarily driven by increase in sales volume in North America and Europe. Both regions will benefit from higher protein productions level as well as continued adoption of advanced product. We also believe our packaging business in Brazil is beginning to stabilize with 4% volume growth in the second quarter. These positive trends will be partially offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand and North America formula pricing. On the bottom line, we continue to expect sequential growth in absolute dollars in the third and fourth quarter, resulting in full year organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. As Jerome noted, Food Care EBITDA will be negatively impacted by our assumption of raw material costs heading into year end.","Let\u2019s turn to Product Care results on Slide 11. Product Care\u2019s net sales in constant dollars were down 1.5% due to a 4% decline in North America, partially offset by mid single-digit growth in EMEA. We continued to experience strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment in the first half of the year on a global basis. In North America, this was more than offset by ongoing weakness in the industrial sector. Also keep in mind that we divested $15 million of annualized sales in North America in January and another $12 million of annualized sales in Europe in May. Excluding these guidance figures, global volume trends would have been stronger and we would have delivered a slight uptake in North America.","In the second half of the year and more so in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, we expect our constant dollar growth rate to accelerate. Demand continues to increase for our Inflatable Bubble, Korrvu, Sealed Air B+ and FloWrap equipment platform. This level of demand is translating into strong double-digit growth in equipment sales and installments. For the full year 2016, top line growth coupled with our focus on pricing and cost discipline will drive constant dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion.","Now, let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Ilham. Turning to Slide 12, free cash flow was a source of cash of $68 million in the first half of the year. CapEx increased to $114 million as compared to $58 million during the same period a year ago, of which $40 million was related to our Charlotte campus. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $165 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year end at 14.3%. As compared to June 30 last year, we improved 130 basis points.","Now turning to outlook on Slide 13, net sales are expected to be approximately $6.85 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $82 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $275 million. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $17 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $45 million.","As Jerome mentioned earlier, we are expecting accelerated EBITDA growth in the second half of the year and anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year. Strength in the fourth quarter will be driven by higher Food Care volumes, our customer rollout schedule in Diversey Care, and seasonal strength in Product Care. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $280 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at the high end of our previously provided range of $2.52 to $2.60.","We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be approximately $150 million.","For the full year, we continue to expect working capital and other assets liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be $110 million and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. As we head into year end, we will focus on what we can control and look for opportunities that will help mitigate the potential impact of the macro environment. We will continue investing to support our future growth opportunities. Our focus on execution and delivering profitable growth is embedded in our winning culture.","Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27. We have invited Ken Chrisman, President of Product Care to join Jerome and I on that call.","With that, operator, can you please open up the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning.","Carol Lowe","Good morning.","Scott Gaffner","Hey, Jerome, Carol, Ilham.","Carol Lowe","I just wanted to look at the EBITDA guidance. So, it comes down to $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion, looks like down $10 million and yet currency is better. You had a better than expected first half and you are talking about accelerating EBITDA growth in the second half. What is it that\u2019s maybe below expectations for the full year now that\u2019s caused that reduction in the EBITDA guidance?","Jerome Peribere","So, let me first say that really counting on the acceleration that I talked about back in February, I said from the very beginning that the first half was going to be re-reviewed and that we were going to see business acceleration. What I also said was that this was going to grow mostly with volume. What I didn\u2019t think was going to happen to the \u2013 was the assumptions that I have \u2013 that we have put on resin prices and they have been lower than what we thought. That is having an impact on our formula pricing. You know how important they are. And we were thinking at the time that those formula pricing in Food Care in North America were mostly going to be in the first half and not in the second half. Well, because of what resin prices are and we anticipate they are going to be, we are going to have negative formula pricing in the second half and that\u2019s basically how we are seeing the situation today. Having said that, our global price mix in Food Care and price mix versus cost price will be positive for the full year, but not as positive as we had originally forecasted. So, that\u2019s basically the slight difference. This is impacting sales growth because of the net sales as a result of the lower resin prices. But what we are doing here is that we are narrowing the range that we are having and that\u2019s mostly what we are doing here. And keep in mind that pricing dropped straight to the bottom line. So, that\u2019s great. The important thing to remember here is the volume trend. And the volume trend is really as per what we were expecting. And why are we seeing good volume trends? It is very clearly the impact of our innovation is kicking in.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America. Please proceed.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and discussion. I guess I wanted to ask a two-part question. One, just tying maybe a bow on Scott\u2019s question and then I had a question on volumes relative to case-ready and the new products. So, with EBITDA coming down, your \u2013 relative to your prior guidance and we understand the reasons why, your EPS guidance is towards the higher end of the range. Is there some sort of non-cash driver of that or what reconciles that? And then on Optidur, what\u2019s the risk of cannibalization around existing sales? And with Darfresh on Tray, what\u2019s so positive about that now versus prior case-ready offerings? Thank you, guys.","Jerome Peribere","Okay. So, I will answer the third question. The EPS is going to go to Carol. Let me just talk about Optidur and Darfresh on Tray. Optidur, when it is fully launched, which means as it is \u2013 as it will have ramped up, we have cannibalization effects, but it will also have strong margin improvements effect, but this is going to be, call it a full year program. We had several generations of Optidur product. And the first one right here that we are introducing for obvious reasons is mostly new business. And this is at this point in time in Europe we have run trials implants in North America, all extraordinarily successful, between you and me, highly, highly compelling product \u2013 products actually. And therefore, overall, in time, it\u2019s going to be a quarter of sales cannibalization but dramatically improved margin expansion for all kind of reasons that we already have talked about and stuff.","With regards to Darfresh on Tray, the value selling proposition in several fronts. Number one, you have vacuum skin packaging, which is improving shelf life and this has value for the retailer. It also has value for the producer because of the shipping time, etcetera and it has value for the consumer, because he can keep the product freezer-ready keep the product logger in his fridge, etcetera, etcetera. Then in the production, the equipment runs extremely fast. And also for the production, the producer, you also have no human waste on the top lid because of the way the machine works versus about 20% to 40% waste on the lid. On the EPS, Carol, any comments?","Carol Lowe","Yes. George, with EPS, one of the changes is the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization of about $5 million. Also our share count as we are exiting Q2, were at approximately 197 million shares outstanding. We are seeing benefit from share repurchases going into the weighted average calculation from the first quarter where we spent about $32 million to buy almost 700,000 shares back in Q2. We spent approximately $20 million to buy an additional 435 shares back. So, year-to-date, we are at 1.13 million shares with the spend of $52 million. I will remind everyone we still have $832 million available under our July 2015 Board authorization. And managing within our targeted leverage range of 3.5x to 4x, we would expect to return value to shareholders as we consistently messaged as we move forward throughout the year, again maintaining within our leverage.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please proceed.","Lori Chaitman","Good morning Ghansham.","Jerome Peribere","Hi Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi","Yes. Good morning guys. I guess sticking on the growth question, can you just give us your view on second half end market growth for your three segments across the various regions, obviously it\u2019s a very complicated backdrop. And then also, how much in total do you think your new growth initiatives will add to that growth rate? Thanks so much.","Jerome Peribere","Okay. So I can detail you the \u2013 what the growth initiatives are going to give right away. But as I said, starting with Food Care, our growth is led by innovation. We are in trials with Darfresh on Tray with two large retailers. Things are going extremely well. It takes time to all of this and then to have the full adoption, etcetera, because of all of these requires investments. But \u2013 what I would say if you just go back to our Investor Day of exactly a year ago, it\u2019s all happening and better. When you look at Product Care, and I would let then Ilham comment on Diversey Care, you absolutely need to come to Pack Expo this autumn as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. You will see in there as the booth with the highest innovation and that is what is driving our growth. Our e-commerce business is growing extremely well. What is the issue in Product Care, it\u2019s one and simple, is that industrial GDP is not good. Well, if you look at the CAS index, which is truck and rail freight index, it is at the lowest since 2010 right now. So you can\u2019t pretend that the economy, the industrial economy is doing really well because it doesn\u2019t. But when you look at e-commerce and when you look at how we are doing in that environment, actually we clearly are partnering with our customers fulfillment companies 3PLs to join them in the growth they are expecting and in the growth map. We have multiplied by 2.5 the installs of our small equipment in North America. We have done the same, but we have increased by 15% the install of our small equipment in EMEA and almost 30% in Asia. So this tells you that the consumer was going to come during the year. Some comments on Diversey Care, Ilham?","Ilham Kadri","Yes. So Ghansham on Diversey Care, I think you have seen the numbers. I am extremely proud of the hard work done by the Diversey Care team and all the important fractions we delivered to report EBITDA. I will give you some colors on regional performance, Europe was extremely strong showing continued momentum since we start transforming this business back in 2013. This was nice growth to raise both markets in South Europe, in Germany. We are winning customers like in the UK where we are rolling out and we will start picking in by the end of the year. In North America, North America returns to growth as we told you in quarter two. Thanks to our healthcare business doing extremely great, with our unique sustainability \u2013 technologies there, as well as we are rolling out the large customers in facility management. We are rolling out as we speak. And we have implemented and kudos to the team help of the 50,000 sites in the report timing and we are tracking ahead of time. And last but the least, in APAC, we have good momentum there as well. We are growing above the industries we serve, with 4% out of the \u201916. Diversey Care coming from volume level, as we told you China is growing high single-digits and India mid double-digitS, just to highlight few leading and strategic economies for our Sealed Air economy.","Jerome Peribere","What should made Diversey Care full in the second half is what you and I read in the newspapers, which means that in Diversey Care for example, you have tourism which is strongly impacted in Europe. You have tourism down and some hotel chains have published some results. And you can see that tourism is down in France, tourism down in Belgium, down in Morocco, dramatically down in Turkey, somewhat down in the Middle East. In Egypt, capacity \u2013 hotel capacity utilization is at 55% and is at 50% in Turkey. So you just can\u2019t dream of a perfect world because it\u2019s not. That is going to \u2013 two things are going to impact a little bit Diversey Care in the third quarter and be favorable in the fourth. One is what I just talked about. In the first quarter, remember that tourism is, right now, its big season right now. And the second one is that because of our customer wins, we have a lot, a lot, a lot of installs. And that requires resources, which are being deployed exactly now and we are going to benefit from those sometime next year. And generally speaking, overall on the net sales growth, it is the pricing and the formula pricing of resins which is impacting the dollar sales growth, but definitely not the momentum.","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Arun Viswanathan","Alright. Thank you. Could you just discuss your outlook on the resin price environment and I guess maybe some of the actions that you take to mitigate volatility that you see there?","Jerome Peribere","Okay. So I am not going to go in details, not to signal too much to our competition, but on what we are doing, but we are a large buyer and you should rest assure that we do what it takes to stay very highly competitive. With regards to the resin, actually that\u2019s what I said before. Entering the year, I said in the February call that we were seeing the resin being weak and staying weak for the year. And they haven\u2019t been that weak, because you have had these price increases in March and you had these price increases in April. And whereas one could anticipate that they wouldn\u2019t hold for a long time, so far, so good for the producers. They have helped quite a lot. So therefore this has happened and we will have in the second half a negative impact, which is in fact eliminating the positive impact from lower \u2013 from better currency movements that we were anticipating. So we are going to have a negative formula pricing there. And I just don\u2019t know what to tell you because I don\u2019t think that resin prices would be where they are as I wouldn\u2019t ask that they would be at the beginning of the year where they are right now. So yes, capacity is going to come in next year and so on. And the whole thing will very much depend on hurricane. We are entering the hurricane season. So some people are wishing for lots of hurricane and some wish for nothing, etcetera. So it\u2019s very difficult to predict one. If you have one or two hurricanes hitting Texas, I tell you this is going to change the game.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Philip Ng","Hi guys. Should we expect the product rationalization on Product Care largely behind you at this point and will that help firm up demand despite some of the weakness you are calling in the industry economy and stabilize or kind firm up price in the back half, I would have thought given some of the mix improvements you are doing on e-commerce, that would have kind of helps down pricing? Thanks.","Jerome Peribere","Hi, Phil, good questions \u2013 so some comments on the economy. Our industrial parts is today moving forward than the e-commerce parts. The e-commerce and 3PL is growing and it\u2019s growing very nicely, but it is still at the 30% and. And this is where our growth is going to be. We anticipate that we can take full advantage of our equipment and our consumables in that market sector. We are completely reinventing this division and it is growing absolutely fabulous. I told you, I told you at the very beginning of this year, I told you at the end of last year that you will be surprised with our innovation momentum and customer pickup over time and starting in the second half. We have all the time to confirm that this is going on. So, now rationalization, I told you also in January that we have just divested from historic line in the U.S., which is $15 million of sales. I told you that we were going to be closing in the second quarter on the plant and the product line in France. And I think I told you that was about $12 million.","So to your question, yes, we believe that this is basically over in terms of product rationalization there. We have and you are going to look at Brexit. And the Brexit is having an impact on our translation cost. We have a strong business in Product Care, in Food Care also, in Diversey Care also in the UK. So, what we have been clearly doing here is that we have announced for a 6% to 8% price increase effective September 1 later, sometimes earlier, in order to capture the transaction costs that we are suffering from the UK pound. And that is what I would say embedded in our culture now, which is don\u2019t take those kind of things and absorb it, because we are not in that business. So, we have communicated that to our customers, we are moving on. And actually between you and me, we have been a little bit surprised by how easy this is going through, because everybody understands that this is the way it\u2019s supposed to be.","Carol Lowe","Yes. And so I think it\u2019s also important and it\u2019s on our slides that just to highlight four products here, the continued strong improvement in margins. So, for the second quarter an improvement of 40 basis points over a year ago on our adjusted EBITDA and for the full half, a 60 basis point improvement and when you look at the challenges with the industrial market that Jerome has highlighted, I think that\u2019s just very, very strong performance by the team.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Adam Josephson","Thanks. Good morning. Jerome or Carol, just one clarification on organic sales growth, I think last quarter you stopped disclosing a growth target and there was some weakness in Brazil and Venezuela that you called out. Now, I think Jerome you are saying that the impact of lower resin prices is having a profound impact on your organic net sales, dollar sales. You are also talking about global economic weakness as evident in industrial conditions, tourism etcetera. So, I am just trying to understand exactly what the puts and takes are in terms of your organic sales forecast now compared to where it was 6 months ago. It would really be helpful. Thank you.","Jerome Peribere","Yes, good question. So, what did I say at the beginning of the year, I said about 2.5%. And what you are seeing is that it\u2019s going to be slightly less than 3%. And that is not because of volume, it is because of resin prices and a little bit of weakness in the sectors on hospitality that I just talked about, but those kinds of things and situations are happening every single day. Every single day we have positives and we have negatives. So, if resin prices have \u2013 would have gone up another 10%, you would have seen our sales growth go up more than what I would have said at the beginning of the year and 3.5%. And there is a lag on those kind of things because of the pricing. So, the real question to say is that, so you were saying 3.5%, you are saying slightly less than 3%, is there a problem? Well, no, it\u2019s basically when you have a raw material, which is a part of your cost base and when you have formulas, which in time correct for your overall pricing without impacting your margin, you have \u2013 you booked slightly less dollar sales. If we have resin prices going up or doubling in the next 5 years was you are going to see proportional improvements from Sealed Air, which was not necessarily the case under a few years ago, you are going to see a proportional increase in our top levered sales. So, that separates what is an external environment, which impacts potentially your net sales, but not your margins with internal issues. Let me confirm to you point blank very clearly, we are ahead of everything we said we would be doing in our Investor Day. Our innovation is kicking in better. And this is what is going to fuel our margin and our business in the future.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris Manuel","Good morning. And I guess I want to kind of follow-up here, because I am still a little bit confused on a couple of topics. Look I think coming into the year to kind of come back to Adam\u2019s point, you guys were anticipating a pointer I think it was 3%ish plus growth with 2% of it being organic and one being priced. And now as material costs are falling, I mean, my understanding was for a lot of your formulaic pass-throughs that it\u2019s basically passing through and then it doesn\u2019t have a dollar impact to Sealed Air. It sounds now like maybe Jerome what you are saying is that while you are still on track to get volume growth to the back half of the year to make up that piece that the revenue growth might not be there because some of the mechanisms are lowering price. Is there something perhaps different in the competitive landscape today that\u2019s not enabling you to \u2013 or that\u2019s cutting price perhaps more than just what the formulas are moving that\u2019s impeding your ability to kind of work on the net price side? What\u2019s changed perhaps from a quarter or so ago to today or this has progressed?","Jerome Peribere","Okay. Well, Chris I don\u2019t know how to say that. I told you nothing. I told you that we had 3% growth in Food Care in North America in the second quarter, not bad actually. We had, in the second quarter, 3% growth. I told you that we had slightly less than 6% negative growth in Latin America. If you take out Venezuela, again in Food Care, if you take out Venezuela, we would have had volume growth in Latin America. So, things are stabilizing. We are very happy with what\u2019s going on in Brazil. The way our management, local management, has turned things around and very key. We are doing very well in EMEA and this is all about Food Care and we have about the same in Product Care and Diversey Care. So, what I am telling you here, we have given you a guidance of about 6850 for the total year in total sales. We have benefit some on currency on the one side. And what I have just talked about a few minutes ago is giving you the answer on the net selling price, which is impacted by the resin cost and the formula pricing. So, you were referring to competition. Well, look at our competition and look at how we are growing our volumes compared to how our competition is growing volume. Product Care is growing fabulous. Food Care is growing fabulous. And we are doing very well. We had a bumper year, record year in Diversey Care at the very same time.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning. Jerome, could you give us a quick view of how the beef business is looking for you guys in Food Care around the world and how things may have changed since the last call?","Jerome Peribere","Okay. So, let me start with the good news, which is that Australia beef cycle is stabilizing. It\u2019s only down 0.5%, which is better than originally anticipated. Remember that it was exactly 12 months ago going gangbusters with a 10% growth in the slaughter rates, which was clearly unsustainable and then it went down over the fourth quarter and first quarter. Now, it seems that it is stabilizing there. You have the volumes in North America and which have been going up. And now you are going to see this have been nicely going up in the second quarter. It seems to be a sign for a very slight pause in the third quarter, but that\u2019s going to be because of the very heavy second quarter harvest. But overall, it is anticipated to increase by over 3.5%. So that trend is on and it\u2019s moving. And you know that over the cycle, we are going to move from about 22 million had slaughtered to 27 million, 28 million by the end of the decade. That is on its way. When \u2013 then, in \u2013 you look at the situation in Russia, which is developing its herd, etcetera, things are positive. By the way, our business down there is doing absolutely wonderful. And when you look at how our local business is going, Russia is up by 15%. Spain is up by 8%. And the exports of meat in \u2013 out of Brazil have started to improve and things are going better. So I would say that what we were anticipating is really happening. And I can once again assure you that we have a high share in that business and we continue to gain share. Thanks to our bags business, and thanks to our Darfresh on Tray and to OptiDure.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark Wilde","Good morning Jerome. Good morning Carol. Just to follow on Chip\u2019s question there, Jerome, is it possible for you to give us some sense of the size of your North American beef business versus the size of your beef business in all of those offshore markets?","Jerome Peribere","No, we don\u2019t publish. We don\u2019t give that. But we have given indication of the overall market impact. Our \u2013 globally, our fresh red meat market is about 30% of our total sale. And that\u2019s as much as we give. But I have given indications in the previous earnings call about how to size this kind of business.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, I think we have time for one or two more questions please.","Operator","Your next question comes on the line of Jason Freuchtel of SunTrust. Please proceed.","Jeff D\u2019Angelo","Hi, good morning. This is just Jeff D\u2019Angelo sitting in for Jason Freuchtel. My first question is when do you expect to be able to quit making restructuring payments, are you still anticipating generating $775 million in free cash flow by 2018. And on top of that, how should we see CapEx trending over the next few years?","Carol Lowe","Okay. Good morning Jeff. I will take that. With respect to the guidance that we provided, just as a reminder, the expense that we will see this year to hit the P&L is estimated \u2013 the cash related to that at approximately $110 million. And we also within CapEx activities for our new campus and other restructuring investment of around $140 million. If we look at the cash flow as we move forward that approximately, restructuring cash payments for 2017, we have previously stated around $95 million. And then some will trail into 2018. But we should be substantially done in 2017. We always remind everyone though, that it\u2019s not as easy to forecast as it relates to certain actions we have take in various countries. And some of our restructuring is also related to our footprint optimization for supply chain. And the timing of some of that spend, capital and related expense can be very lumpy.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please proceed.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. Just going back to the discussion of weaker hospitality demand in Middle East and I think you mentioned Europe as well, is it possible to size how much of a hit that was in the second quarter or maybe how much of a hit you might have baked into the second half guidance or maybe what percentage of your hospitality demand in Diversey is in these regions where you have seen some impact from macro events?","Ilham Kadri","So I can take it. On Diversey Care, as you know Q2 is our strongest quarter historically and the results are in line with that. Quarter three is a hospitality quarter, right, its seasonal business, although hospitality is only 10% to 12% of our business globally through the year. And as you know, trends are weakening in Europe, Middle East and Africa because of the political unrest, you heard me say it\u2019s tough, but in fact, we did okay in quarter two and you are all familiar with what\u2019s going on. So tourism is suffering and we suffer from all of this. Therefore, we will experience a slowdown. And that\u2019s why in quarter three you will see a slowdown of the pace of the growth in Diversey Care. I remain confident longer term about the regional promise and the sector promise as we went through this several times in our life, right. And the business is extremely resilient. We have very good people there. They have been through turbulences several times and the fundamentals longer term are extremely good. Anything to add, Jerome?","Jerome Peribere","I would say that it explains \u2013 no, we like to be very transparent on all of those things. It doesn\u2019t mean that it has a huge impact. What we are saying is that we have as a result of all the good initiatives that we have taken, we have a fabulous quarter in the second quarter in Diversey Care and it\u2019s not going to be another record quarter ever in the third quarter. But we are pretty confident on our growth. We have had a companion annual growth rate in the last few years in our line of about 12% in constant currency. And we are going to be optimistic that this is going to continue.","Carol Lowe","And before we go to last question, Lori cut me off before I give an answer to Jeff\u2019s question on the 2018 target. So just to go quickly back to that with respect to free cash flow, we are continuing to drive towards the targets that we shared in June 2015 at our Analyst Day, focusing on profitable growth and remain confident in the business\u2019 ability to deliver on the growth rate and profitability improvement. We have always been a strong free cash flow generator and expect to be as we move forward. Obviously, the risk relates to currency. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s out of our control, but we always do our best to mitigate that. And Jerome talked about our actions from a pricing standpoint when we see devaluation.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you. Operator, I am not sure if there is one more person in the queue, but otherwise I think we actually have hit our time.","Operator","Yes, you do have one final question from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you.","Brian Maguire","Thanks for squeezing me in. Jerome, I just wanted to ask you about dimensional pricing for a minute, just curious how the customer adoption on that has gone so far. And I know you signed some strategic partnerships during the quarter, just wondering if you could expand upon what those will allow you to do that you couldn\u2019t do on your own. And then just finally, when do you think we will start to see this kind of moves the needle on the volume or price numbers for the Product Care segment? Thanks.","Jerome Peribere","So, as I mentioned, weight and pricing is a big booster to our business. Thanks to our B+ and FloWrap technologies, etcetera, our new Korrvu innovation also providing all of the sales. Just to answer very short your question. You are going to see all of this in the third \u2013 and especially in the fourth quarter, because Q4 is an e-commerce quarter. And all the cards are set for a bumper quarter there. And I can\u2019t be more pleased with the transformation of that division. I have made no mystery that we are just completely revolutionizing this industry. Our customers are responding. And not only they are responding to [indiscernible], but they are responding to something, which is very, very new, which is that they will now start to understand that the packaging look, how you present your products through e-commerce packaging is very important. We have all kinds of studies and we are continuing them and we are going to publish them at Pack Expo are showing that the image of the retailer or of the e-commerce company is dramatically conveyed through the packaging, which is by the way something that you could very instinctively understand. And as a result of this, our new Korrvu line is actually getting a lot of traction. So, come to Pack Expo, you will be very positive.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, I believe there is one question in the follow-up queue. It looks like George Staphos is trying to ask a follow-up question. If you see him in the queue, can you please open his lines?","Operator","Yes. Mr. Staphos, your line is now open. And Mr. Staphos has just disconnected his line.","Lori Chaitman","Okay. Alright, thank you very much for everybody joining us today. And if you have any follow-up additional calls, please reach out to myself and I will be happy to follow-up. Thank you.","Jerome Peribere","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"19129":["Sealed Air Corporation.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference may being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you Sabrina. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future period are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in our earnings release, and slide presentation which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors.","Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or at the SEC's website at sec.gov.","We will also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP.

Included in today\u2019s presentation on slide three, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that correspond to some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures we referenced through the presentation.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ted Doheny, our President and CEO. Ted?","Ted Doheny","Thanks, Lori. I want to thank all of you for your interest in Sealed Air and welcome to our 2017 fourth quarter and year-end conference call. I\u2019ll begin the call with a few brief comments and then ask Bill to expand upon our press release and provide additional background on our financial results for the quarter and the year.","I\u2019ll then provide you with our strategy and outlook for 2018 with a discussion around end market growth and how we plan to further leverage our innovations. I\u2019ll also discuss actions we are taking to improve operational productivity across the globe.","After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll conduct a question and answer session. To recap 2017 results, let\u2019s start with what went well. Our sales accelerated into yearend resulting in a 9% constant dollar growth in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. Throughout the year, we capitalized on strong end market trends within the protein and e-commerce sectors.","We reported adjusted EBITDA and EPS of $833 million and $1.81 per share respectively, slightly higher than guidance we provided on our last conference call. Free cash flow was above our expectations at $420 million due to working capital management. We executed on our share repurchase program returning 1.3 billion of capital since January 2017 through the use of open market and accelerated share repurchase programs.","We have more than $860 million currently remaining under our authorised share repurchase program. What we would like to improve is our operating leverage, meaning how our year-over-year sales growth translates in to earnings growth.","In 2017, our operating leverage or what we call our profit to growth ratio was only 10%. We expect this ratio to double in 2018 with planned cost reductions and higher sales of our market leading solutions offsetting the expected rise of our input costs.","Today, we are the premier specially packaging company in the world. I\u2019m excited to see the potential that we have within Sealed Air and our ability to take our performance to the next level. I\u2019ve been working closely with their leadership team to accelerate our strategy. We\u2019ll focus on growth from new innovations, drive operational excellence, recognize and promote talent and target strategic M&A all of which will produce higher returns on invested capital and maximise free cash flow, taking us to world class performance.","Let me now pass the call to Bill to provide more detail on our fourth quarter and year-end results. Bill?","William Stiehl","Thank you Ted. Turning to slide five, let\u2019s start with the review of our net sales by region. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $1.2 billion in net sales, an increase of 11% on our reported basis and 9% on a constant basis. All regions delivered constant dollar sales growth. Asia Pacific was our fastest growing region at 17% growth, which includes sale from our recent Fagerdala acquisition in the integrated fabrication solutions space.","Sales in North America were up 10% with Food Care delivering 10% and Product Care delivering 9%. Latin America was up 6% led by a strong rebound in the fresh meat markets coupled with new customer wins in Brazil.","Europe, Middle-East and Africa increased 5% with positive trends in France, the U.K. and Italy.","Slide six illustrates net sales by region for the full year. North America was our fastest growing region followed by Asia Pacific. We are pleased to report that sales improved in EMEA and Latin America in the second half of the year resulting in favourable sales trend in both regions.","Turning to slide seven, let me walk you through our fourth quarter net sales and adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.2 billion in net sales. Volume contributed $55 million, price mix was $23 million favourable and we reported $24 million in incremental sales from our Fagerdala acquisition.","Currency translation was favourable $25 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $238 million or 19.4% of net sales. Volume growth contributed $21 million and mix and price\/cost spread was $2 million favourable.","The fourth quarter represents the first time in 2017 that we reported a positive mix and price \/cost spread. Restructuring savings were $4 million. Operating costs including acquisitions increased $10 million. Currency was a favourable $5 million.","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.58 on an average diluted shares outstanding of $176 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 34% in the fourth quarter.","On slide eight, we illustrate the same bridge for the full year. Our topline growth in 2017 was primarily driven by strong volume. Adjusted EBITDA performance was attributable to volume growth partially offset by higher raw material costs, stranded cost related to the divestiture of the Diversey business and salary and wage inflation.","Adjusted earnings per share were $1.81 on an average diluted shares outstanding of $189 million. We exited the year with 168 million shares outstanding. Our adjusted tax rate for the full year 2017 was 30% in line with our forecast.","Turning to slide nine, we highlight the impact of the U.S. tax reform. In the fourth quarter, we reported a $36 million tax expense to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets from 35% to 21%.","The actual impact of the transition tax is still being evaluated and we will record this in the first quarter of 2018. For 2018, we estimate that our effective income tax rate will be approximately 29%. The benefit of the U.S. corporate rate reduction is largely offset for us by the base broadening provisions. Going forward, we will absolutely continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our tax posture.","Let\u2019s turn to our free cash flow for the full year on slide 10. 2017 free cash flow on a consolidated basis was a source of cash of $421 million. This compares to the guidance we provided on our last earnings call of approximately $400 million. The upside and consolidated free cash flow was driven by great working capital management.","CapEx was $184 million which includes $23 million related to other CapEx restructuring activities. In those payments, net of interest income were $186 million and cash tax payments were $152 million.","Let me now pass the call back to Ted for more details on our revisions as well as our outlook.","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Bill. Turning to slide 11 which highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. On a global basis, volume trends were up 4% to 5% throughout the year. This compares to volume trends of 1% to 2% throughout 2016.","In the fourth quarter of 2017, we delivered favourable price mix which helped offset higher material cost. Our pricing actions in Product Care went into effect September 1 and in Food Care for a non-formula customers effective October 1.","As we move forward, we\u2019ll continue to take price actions on a rising input cost. We recognize the success of our value capture pricing strategy is dependent on our ability to save our customers money and solve their most critical packaging challenges, through a highly differentiated products, services and solution we\u2019ll do just that, save money and solve problems.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 12 and review Food Care results. For the full year of 2017, Food Care delivered $2.8 billion in net sales or 4% constant dollar sales growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $608 million or 21.6% of net sales.","On the top line our business benefit from the continued adoption of our market leading portfolio and the growing protein market particularly in North America. However, the timing of formula pricing and rapidly increasing raw material cost put some pressure on our margins throughout the year.","As we look forward, I want to highlight the trends driving our profitable growth strategy in 2018. First, our case ready platform including both materials and systems accounted for nearly 20% of our Food Care sales in 2017, and delivered high single digit growth. We expect this level of growth to continue as we further penetrate global market and introduce new, sustainable solutions for the seafood in convenient segments.","Second, in high growth geographies, such as Brazil, Russia, China and Southeast Asia we are well-positioned to serve the increased demand for package protein, and drive the adaption of applications that extend shelf life and reduce shrink.","And third, we expect continued growth in North America, yet at a more moderated rate as compared to 2017. For the full year of 2018, we expect Food Care sales to increase 3% in constant dollars and adjusted EBITDA margins to be relatively in line with 2017.","Similar to last year, we expect Q1, 2018 to be a low point for EBITDA, primarily due to the timing of our contract pass-through and higher input cost.","Moving to slide 13 where we highlight results from our Product Care division. For the full year 2017, Product Care delivered $1.6 billion in net sales for a 8% constant dollar growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $332 million or 20.2% of sales.","We will continue to work our portfolio towards a higher mix of solutions and services that eliminate waste. These solutions include our growing portfolio of inflatables, our automated systems such as I-Pack, StealthWrap in our unique Korrvu platform.","Inflatables, Automated Systems in Korrvu increased in excess of 15% and accounted for approximately 20% of our total sales in 2017. Another highlight in 2017 is the positive trend we are seeing in Instapak business.","Our business-to-business customers are under increasing pressures to modify their packaging for the small parcel e-commerce fulfilment network, a trend called ship in own container or SIOC. This aligns well with our pallet-to-parcel strategy. Sales of Instapak were up in the mid single digits and we expect this to continue into 2018.","With the addition of Fagerdala in the fourth quarter, we are now a leading provider of packaging solution serving the electronics market. We keep finding additional synergies from these acquisitions where we can lever a broad leverage, a broad solutions portfolio and global reach.","For the full year 2018, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 7%. We are seeing profitable growth from our recent acquisition of Fagerdala and expect it to contribute $95 million in Product Care sales.","Even with the integration of cost associated with Fagerdala acquisition and resilient raw material environment, we expect Product Care margins to be close to 20% level in 2018.","Turning to our Total Company 2018 outlook on slide 14, net sales are expected to be in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.8 billion with constant dollar growth of approximately 4.5%. Adjusted EBITD is expected to be in a range of $890 million to $910 million, implying an EBITDA margin of 19%.","I would like to highlight that we are taking actions to realign our corporate function. In 2018, we expect corporate cost to be below $100 million compared to the $107 million in 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $2.35 to $2.45. This forecast assumes no additional share repurchases in 2018.","We forecast free cash flow from continuing operations to be approximately $400 million, net of capital expenditures of $160 million. Our free cash flow forecast also includes a $45 million payment in lieu of certain royalty payments for patents to an outside engineering firm.","Just before year-end, we entered into an agreement to pay $50 million of which $5 million was paid in 2017 and the remaining was paid in late January. By taking design ownership in-house or expediting our organizational productivity initiatives.","Keep in mind that cash flow of $421 million we recorded in 2017 is on a consolidated basis. If you exclude the cash generated from Diversity in 2017, our free cash flow outlook in 2018 reflects a year-over-year.","To wrap up this call, I\u2019d like to provide a brief discussion on our strategic directions which you can see at a high level on slide 15. First, we will focus on increasing sales from a highly differentiated, innovative, sustainable and profitable solutions that are in high demand in the market. We\u2019ll target incremental, profitable growth opportunities in adjacent markets and expand our presence in high-growth geographies. In the end to reiterate what I said on our last earnings call, regarding M&A, we are looking for technology, equipment and automation opportunities that enhance our business and are accretive to earnings.","Second, we\u2019ll optimize our cost structure by doing more with less and by investing in working smarter. This goes beyond our efforts to eliminate stranded costs related to the Diversey sale. We\u2019re creating a one Sealed Air culture that will drive productivity gains and eliminate redundancy.","For instance, in January, we had expanded the responsibility of some of the most talented leaders to attack our biggest challenges. Karl Deily, in addition to his role as President of our Food Care business is now also leading our innovation\u2019s team for all of Sealed Air.","We moved sustainability under innovation to accelerate our efforts as sustainability is critical to our customer\u2019s success. Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division is now also leading commercial action to strengthen the partnership with our Global Sales team to simplify our processes, lower our cost structure and offer exceptional customer service globally.","And Mark Hammer, our CIO and Chief Digital Officer, is taking on additional responsibility to lead our customer service team. This is in addition to the exciting digital work that Mark is already leading with their team on our smartly connected products and enabling our automated solutions. With Mark leading customer service, we\u2019ll invest in tools and technologies that better connects our team with our internal and external systems, so that we get the right product and the right place at the right time.","Third, we\u2019ll maximize our operating leverage with the successful implementation of the Sealed Air operating excellence culture. We already had big systems in place, but we clearly had opportunities for improvement.","For instance, we are upgrading assets to the latest technologies investing in breakthrough production processes. We\u2019ll continue our efforts on SKU rationalization simplify our supply chain and improve quality.","Our operational discipline will apply not only internally, but also externally with our customers, in future acquisition to quickly capture synergies. And lastly, we\u2019ll continue to develop sustainable solutions that leave our world, environment and communities better than we found them.","We are always finding new ways to reduce our resource intensity and waste for ourselves and our customers. Addressing foodwaste, product damage in our environment are all priorities for us. By moving sustainability under innovation, it will be at the core of what we do and how we operate.","Accelerating our efforts and sustainability will not only make us more profitable, it\u2019s the right thing to do. We are committed to creating value for our customer\u2019s shareholders in the communities where we live and work. Before I open up the call for your questions, we ask that you please mark your calendars for Thursday, May 3 for our first quarter 2018 earnings call.","Sabrina, we would like to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Your line is now open.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey guys good morning.","Ted Doheny","Good morning.","Ghansham Panjabi","So first off you\u2019ve seen a very nice acceleration in Food volumes during the back half of 2017 at up 5%, pricing is also starting to flow through in that segment, I know you have tougher comps, but were you expecting a particular region to see a moderation in volumes in 2018, I guess in front to reconcile a momentum you saw in the backhalf 2017 versus your 3% core sales guidance for that segment for 2018?","Ted Doheny","This is Ted. Hi Ghansham, what we are looking at basically continuing the volume of the fourth quarter but if we break it up by region, continued strength of North America, but that will be tampered year-over-year as we highlight it. We do think some opportunity in Europe moving that up basically due to our equipment. Latin America was a pickup, we had some strong equipment sales but we do think the pickup year-over-year will probably be tampered from what we saw in the fourth quarter.","Ghansham Panjabi","Got it. And just as a follow up question, on your EBITDA waterfall slide for fiscal year 2017 and the 49 million in unfavorable price cost, Ted how should we sort of think about the recovery timeline associated with that? Thanks so much.","Ted Doheny","So the EBITDA on the bridge?","Ghansham Panjabi","Hmm.","Ted Doheny","Well first of all as you\u2019ve highlighted the pricing issue that we were chasing all of 2017, we saw some catch up in the fourth quarter, but we are still behind on the catch-up up with a price cost mix. We think in the first quarter, we still have residents that we could be working against us. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ll probably get ahead of that until maybe the second year of the year, so it looks like continued discipline on the pricing should help us stay ahead of it. Bill if you want to ask anything more on this","William Stiehl","No I think we are very happy about the \u2013 for the fourth quarter of 2017 we saw a very positive price cost spread. I mean, we did not have that luxury in the earlier part of 2017 and we are very excited to have this go positive and we think this is a good momentum going forward into 2018, although as we indicated our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sale is flat in total Food Care from 2017 to 2018.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please. Thanks Ghansham","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclay. Your line is now open.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow up on that real quick, on the increased raw material pricing. I know it\u2019s early in your tenure with the company, but anything that you see so far around the ability for Sealed Air to maybe move more towards automatic pass through of resins on a go forward basis, are you comfortable with where the company stands today from a pricing perspective?","Ted Doheny","Yes, good question as being a price zealot in my past and building off of the good work that Jerome has done. If you look at that, what I\u2019ve been looking understanding how the formula pricing works with our Food Care business. And I think that it works out well, the danger with that is the shock that hit looking at what happened with Harvey is how quickly can recover. So don\u2019t like the fact that we can\u2019t catch up to that quickly, it does catch up over time to lead lag on that.","On the Product Care side though when we are connected to our customers, we should be able to respond more quickly and effectively on price. I think if we analyze last year on the pricing, I think we could have got ahead of that sooner, quicker and the team recognized and understand that. I think we\u2019re on top of that pricing billing in to 2018.","I think the real issue that like to accelerate, I see it in the business and it\u2019s exciting, and you hear us talk about value capture is what we are doing in the marketplace. It\u2019s really saving our customers significant amount of money with some of these new solutions.","And then really how do we share that savings? So I think we have some opportunity on value capture going forward. I think the discipline in the business is there. Shocks hurt us, so we got to find a way to get ahead of that quicker, but I think on the pricing side, there\u2019s some good things there. The opportunity as we drive more solutions and especially as we bring equipment, becoming a larger part of our portfolio as our customers drive to automation, I think we have some pricing or value capture opportunity going forward.","Scott Gaffner","Okay and you mentioned -- the follow-up to that. You mentioned that you expected some drag from rising raw material prices in the first half of 2018. And Bill I think you mentioned 20% EBITDA margin in product care. Where should we \u2013 are we going to see that more -- the rising raw material, lingering raw material increase more in food care or more in product care as we move through 2018? Thanks.","Ted Doheny","I\u2019ll go first and let\u2019s see if Bill wants to add some color to that. As we mentioned we see that the raw material going up and as we look it that\u2019s going into the fourth quarter we saw more pressure for lots of different reasons, oil etcetera putting pressure on the raw material environment. So we think it\u2019s still going to be a resilient environment that we\u2019re going to have to manage through probably the whole first half of the year, so if we do see improvement it\u2019ll be in the second half but not to the first half. Our guidance is based on the resin environment being flat. So slightly up for the full year and so if we see a benefit we don\u2019t see it \u2013 we don\u2019t see any in our guidance until a little bit potentially in the second half of the year.","William Stiehl","I think the original assumptions that a lot of folks have relative to 2018 would've been that we would've seen some quicker decreases in resin prices in 2018 because of Harvey and the other factors that Ted has indicated we haven\u2019t enjoy that decrease and we\u2019re actually planning on an increase in the resin cost as we go year-over-year moving forward. But it is something that we watch and we\u2019re in constant communication with our supply chain team to assess the current impact of any changes in resin prices on our total P&L give our understanding of what percentage of our customer and food care versus product care are on formula pricing versus those that are not on formula prices.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all of the detail and congratulation on the year and good luck going forward Bill and Ted. I guess the first question I had just piggybacking on the last couple of questions from Scott and Ghansham on food. So, on the one hand your price increases in food and non-contract came little bit later than product care and that might be one of the reasons that you had less price cost mix positive, it was a negative in the last quarter versus positive in product care. Question one, are you out with any additional non-formula price increase in food or for that matter in product care. And should we assume for the time being that price mix cost for food care is at least as negative if not worst for the first half, and then had a question on operational excellence.","Ted Doheny","So, the answer is yes. We were out there with price increase, but as you know George we got the lead lag there seeing the effect of that. So, we\u2019re out there with the price increase where the formulas will have to wait. Where we don\u2019t have formulas, yes, we\u2019re out there with the price.","George Staphos","And we should assume at least a similar negative if not worst in price cost mix for food for the first half as what you saw in the fourth quarter?","Ted Doheny","I would say, slowly seeing that recover through the year and we just not anticipating the gain till the second half.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you for that. And then the other question I had on operational excellence and some of the other initiatives that you\u2019re going to be building in to Sealed Air, I mean, traditionally Sealed Air at least from our observations was a pretty asset like business to begin with, it tends to have a greater number of smaller facilities that was one of the things that made it such a good cash generator, but that kind of disparate business model might not lend itself to benchmarking and the sorts of things that are usually involved in operational excellence. So tell me where I\u2019m wrong there if you can quantify what kind of uptake you see from this down the road and maybe one or two kind of for instances in terms of what some of the practice that you\u2019ll bring in? Thank you very much.","Ted Doheny","Well, let me unpack a little bit here, if I can correct one word, because the team and working closely, tremendous team. And so I don\u2019t want to call it an initiative and the team is already working on the word, what we\u2019re going to call it a culture, because there\u2019s a lot of good things going on here and I think you understand it\u2019s not the program of the month, how do we drive this culture, so good question is look at the business and is been impacting and traveling the world, looking at our facilities, talking to our customers. Now being on the inside, I see a lot of manufacturing that from the outside looking and I do realize.","So we have a lot of manufacturing opportunities to bring this network together. But its quite interestingly, we buy close to a 1 billion tons of this thing called resin and then we converted into this really, really special products that we sell literally in millions. In our customers, so you want to have a very concentrated huge extrusion lines to do that very effectively and efficiently, but we\u2019re so market focus and so customer focused, they want to buy those specialized bags a 100 at a time.","So how do you do that mixed model being connected around the world, we can't be everywhere at once, so that\u2019s the part of the operational excellence that I think we can do make some impact. So let me unpack that a little bit. Let\u2019s talk about how we buy our resin. The supply chain team has done a really, really nice job of not being dependent on one. Now we haven\u2019t gotten totally where we need to be but diversifying the supply base, so getting through having multiple suppliers that we can work with, so we can get the most effective cost and definitely the most cost compared to our competitors that we serve that market.","The next linking that to our facilities and our engine -- not engineering I apologize. I can\u2019t use engineering now that I came from this company because I\u2019m dealing with scientist. Connecting the scientist on this very, very specialized product, how can we alter our formulas, alter what the facilities are actually producing and converting can do it in with the different process. So, on the operational excellence side linking those too tighter I think we have some significant opportunities.","Then also on the supply chain side connecting how we buy it, how we convert it and then its how we sell it. So operational excellence on just a number of SKUs, there's a lot of working going on there, but can we really analyze, do we need all these different products and if we had the right product in front of our customer we\u2019re able sell quickly and efficiently, maybe they would buy that versus asking for a specialized product for those 10 bags to put in their turkey.","So those are top-three highlights that I\u2019ve seen, I'm sure you'll have or that we follow questions on the capital allocation what work we do with and with respect to operational excellence, but there\u2019s another piece here that\u2019s pretty exciting for me coming in as the new guy taking over Jerome. There was a huge divestiture of this thing called Diversey. So one of the fundamental things were changing is this one seal they look as we had three fairly large divisions and one corporate. So we\u2019re kind of looking at it differently saying let's have one corporate serving two divisions and acting as one company. So there is \u2013 I think there is a lot of opportunity there with the resources focus on serving those two markets as one company.","George Staphos","Thank you, Ted.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Lars Kjellberg","Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to come back to costs. Could you share where you are on addressing this stranded costs and also if you want to progress through a bit about your thoughts about equipment installations and how that can drive your growth going forward if that's going to be an incremental focus to drive that stronger growth and in particular that profit-to-growth doubling that just discussed in 2018?","William Stiehl","So, I\u2019ll address the stranded cost piece and what we had said during last quarter\u2019s earnings call is that we have $20 million of unallocated cost that we were going to address throughout 2018 and if those unallocated cost would be offset by a transition services revenue that we were getting beginning September 6th associated with the Diversey separation. And as we look at our fourth quarter results we saw just this occur that that transition services revenue was able to offset those cost.","And we also pick that momentum in terms of addressing our stranded cost. We\u2019re going to continue to have that transition services agreement revenue for 12 to 18 months after the close of the Diversey Care transaction, but we\u2019ve definitely picked up momentum in addressing stranded cost. You\u2019ll see that relative to our performance in the corporate bucket in the fourth quarter of 2017 being at 107 million versus what we had originally estimated at a 115.","And we also up here to have a increased momentum in the reduction of those stranded cost going forward and we\u2019re highly motivated to make the decisions necessary to get our stranded costs under control and to be a new Sealed Air terms of the corporate cost structure that Ted indicates.","Ted Doheny","And if I can piggyback on that with the corporate costs and you mentioned PG ratios equipment. But to segue those two together, first of all on the corporate cost, we will returning that stranded cost into the phrase of driving organizational productivity. How do we do more with less by investing and working smarter? We will hit and exceed that stranded cost target. And your question in the equipment sales and PG ratio we\u2019re using the PG ratios as a guide to the team. So as we get growth we\u2019re looking to qualify growth, good growth for us is means that we\u2019re call it profitable growth and drive that through our business not just straight growth.","So equipment sales less than 10% of our business in equipment sales, but so what do we do we solve problems. So if you look at both markets its quite interesting if you look at food care and product care. What they do is solve problems. Now food care maybe extending the way the shelf life of the product, but it was quite interesting I\u2019ve gotten and now visit two customers that I was at the Food Show with Karl, just last week and I got the CR booth when we talk about automation. So I got to see chickens being loaded and setup and ready to go into our exclusive bag, but I saw automation on the front side but then there is a lot of people around actually then have to adjust it, getting it ready for the automation where we seal it and protect it and use some of our exclusive processes.","I was listening to customers, watch this process and I heard just incredible data going out. One of our largest customers shared \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe the number, but they have 42% absenteeism. So the more we can work on automation with our equipment help solve that problem significant opportunity, so when we\u2019re looking at capturing the saving, we\u2019re going to slowdown little bit and say, hey, we get a lot of things to sell you, we\u2019re going to say what can we save you and that huge of waste automation is a big deal taking people out of harms way, but another part of way they just don\u2019t have the people right now to talk the manufacturers all over the world, getting the talent to go do this and also taking them out of harms way is a big element of waste.","So how do we then bring that to profitable growth equipment now when we bring those solutions how do we share those saving and bring our exclusive solution to the customer. I think we can drive some significant margin opportunity going forward.","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you and the next question will come of the line of Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Anojja Shah","Hey, good morning. I wanted to go back to the two bridges of the segments. It\u2019s a pretty significant headway in each segment from operating cost. Is that a reallocation of some of the unallocated cost back to the segment or some explanation of what's going on in there and what the outlook is for that line in 2018?","William Stiehl","Thank you very much for the question. And we\u2019ve included our stranded cost and any sort of corporate cost not in our food care, in our product care resolve, but your question relates to the food care and product care operating expense item on the bridge and the strong driver of that negative item when you compare Q4 of 2016 compared to Q4 of 2017 is basically incentive compensation and other compensation related costs. Remember that we\u2019re comparing what our compensation expense would be in the fourth quarter of 2017 with the same period at year ago.","The other point I would make is that Ted and I have certainly positioned ourselves well for our 2018 performance as we will look at expediting certain actions and those have already occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Anojja Shah","Okay. Thank you for that. And thank you for all the detail on the operational excellence program, but is that going to require any capital spending, and if so how much?","Ted Doheny","Well, how about we talk about yes in certain places, but part of our CapEx spending that we have we will need some operational excellence if we have a new process in place to improve our facility. There will definitely some CapEx associated with that. We\u2019re guiding to $160 million of CapEx. We believe that\u2019s enough to accomplish it. We can use about operational excellence, some of its process change and won\u2019t be as capital intensive. Basically simple and this is internally and externally eliminate the waste, simplify the process and then automate.","But before we do the automation we got to do those first steps and there\u2019s a lot of money be save there. So, but yes, we are looking at some interesting capital to solve some problems. Can we solve some of the tough problems like even on the resin with our large extrusion lines to be more effective and efficient, so we\u2019re looking at that, can we even work with our innovation team and different resins that we actually producing for our products. Again as we\u2019re driven to be more sustainable organization can we invest in capital that could change the resins that we use and drive to higher sustainable business for us and for our customer. So there\u2019ll be capital we can deploy in that area as well.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Maguire","Ted, I want to come back to that profit-to-growth ratio you mentioned earlier, I think you said it was at 10% last year. You hope to double it to 20%, I\u2019m assuming you're talking about sort of incremental margins there on the business and the current margins are in each segment already little bit above 20%, so sort of consistent with the guidance you\u2019ve got for segment margins that they maybe down a little bit, but just wondering where you think that that number can go to over time recognizing that you probably have some resin headwinds in 2018 and all these operational improvements won\u2019t really be kicking in yet, but is there a number or a target that you sort of have in mind for where you can get that to over time and how quickly do you think we can get there?","Ted Doheny","Now, it\u2019s a great question. And so, again the profit-to-growth target incremental is we \u2013 I said that we should be able to double that, but long-term what we would be looking, we were pointing to 25% on that. So basically the incremental volume that we bring in, we want to see 25% of that drop to the bottom line. So that\u2019s going to take a little time. So, but to do it in the first year I think clearly we can double it. How we can there faster, we\u2019re going to focus on the cost pretty hard as Bill highlighted. So that cost is we\u2019re going to take care of that.","But the reason why it\u2019s important to put it out there not for you and our investors to understand, but it\u2019s also for our people. So we\u2019re already changing the metrics internally, lots of work with our teams changing our incentive systems, so to be fully aligned that incremental business that we bring in is going to be targeting that 25%. So then the second part of your question of the 25% of where we\u2019re going; if we\u2019re 20% business that showing you that we\u2019re pointing to at 25, so what do we do? We benchmark our peers. We look to what else is out there. But it also gave the teams had a lot of good at work. What is world-class? And that's where I use that subtlety in the phrase of the team that let\u2019s -- we\u2019re pretty good in packaging arguably the premier packaging business I don't argue with the team, but the team positive and says, are we world-class.","So, are we going to point higher than the 25 over time, yes, but right now our sites are, let\u2019s go take this business to where it needs to be. And so that\u2019s going to be the guidelines if the growth coming in and that\u2019s we\u2019re going to commit to, get to. First year, 20%, and we doubling it from where we were, I think we have clear line of sight to do that. Second part of your question, 25 is the internal target if we\u2019re going after.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please. Sorry about that.","Brian Maguire","Sorry. Just at the \u2013 the EPS guide not including any more share repo. Just wondering if there\u2019s any change in the strategy there to pivot towards M&A or is that just for conservatism?","Ted Doheny","Yes. But its part of our capital allocation. As we look at share repurchase if we just want to be very transparent we want to have share that we could pivot off that if we see a better opportunity, a better return for the company both for the first question or the questions were asked about operational excellence, if we see capital we can deploy internally more valuable than buying our shares back then yes, if we see an M&A opportunity it is more valuable than buying our own shares then the answer is yes.","But the other metric that would really drive and trying to inculcate into the whole organization is return on invested capital. So that we\u2019re looking at all of our internal investments whether its CapEx, whether its new products, new innovations, looking even for share repurchase, and that\u2019s we\u2019re going to be focus on the PG ratio on checking out what\u2019s coming in on the sales line and return on invested capital. So we\u2019re talking to you in the same language. We\u2019re talking internally in the same language and that\u2019s we\u2019re designing to. So yes, we have the ability to pivot on that share repurchase.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JP Morgan Your line is now open.","Tyler Langton","Good morning, thank you. Just had a question, I guess the clarification on the growth outlook in 2018 for product care. I think in the slides you mentioned constant dollar growth of 7% including Fagerdala and I think the acquisition I think that would contribute $95 million which seems to be 5% to 6% or that 7%, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of your thought on organic volume growth for product care in 2018?","Ted Doheny","If you pull the \u2013 and by the way just highlighting the 95 million we had -- I think we reported 24 million last year. So it\u2019s not incremental, it could be 95 a year, so we\u2019re looking at Fagerdala to do that. So underneath that with the product care we think we\u2019ll still have reasonable volume in that less than 5% organically if you pull out the Fagerdala and net 3% range just in guidance. So there\u2019s opportunity there but we see year-over-year decent growth for the market. We\u2019re going to go have to create it, but we\u2019re looking for profitable growth and that\u2019s we\u2019re actually guiding and guiding team as well bringing profitable growth and let\u2019s get that 3% on top of the acquisitions that we made for the Fagerdala.","Tyler Langton","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then Bill, I guess the operating costs were kind of I think in total like a 10 million headwind in 4Q and I know you talk about it before, but I guess in 2018, mean that something where sort of given asset which you\u2019re taking and now the total really shouldn\u2019t be drag in 2018 or should we expect some of the drag in the first quarter or two?","William Stiehl","No. We think that the year-over-year comparison that we\u2019re seeing in Q4 of 2017 compared to Q4 of 2016 is the most significant negative comparison we\u2019re going to have. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ll have those negative comps going forward relative to our operating expenses and I have -- you also indicate that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on having the right amount of cost for the new Sealed Air, continue to reduce our stranded cost as we go forward and also to be totally dedicated to as Ted indicates the profitable growth ratio and that concept.","And I will say that that mindset has really about change behaviors here at Sealed Air already, I mean we had an executive committee meeting last week and a large portion of that meeting was spent with the executive leaders speaking about what our specific actions in the first quarter and the second quarter are going to be and the impact on the PG ratio. So it does change behavior and it does translate to the P&L and we were very optimistic in terms of that comp going forward in 2018.","Lori Chaitman","Thanks, Bill. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Your line is now open.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. Ted, in your comments on M&A I think you indicated technology and automation were areas of focus. Is it fair to say that might lend itself to kind of smaller bolt on acquisitions that are kind of maybe more consistent with what Sealed Air has done recently. And then just some of your public peers have done large acquisitions and have argued that boosting their purchase, their resin purchase scale is a competitive advantage not sure if you subscribe to that, but just wonder if you give more color on M&A?","William Stiehl","No. I think its good question and I\u2019ll just build off the guidance that was out there from Jerome even back in back in 2015 looking in that we were in that $400 million look, so building off of that size. The danger for just seeing you buying a company because you can make a cost synergy to me doesn\u2019t sound strategic because that\u2019s one year-over-year, we can have tremendous \u2013 I think that\u2019s an adder if we find a strategic acquisition that fits in our space and we could leverage our supply chain excellence there. Yes. But buying it just because we see a resin advantage, we really are probably looking more is there a strategic advantage that we can have some technology, some competitive advantage to win in the marketplace.","That said, the size we are looking at in our space is something is an opportunity for us about 400 million that fits in to our businesses can drive our food care business, can drive product care business and has a differentiating technology and definitely that would be something that would be interesting to us. I think bringing our operation of excellence capability to those within just be an exciting synergy that we could make that accretive quicker.","So we\u2019re looking at it. Yes, we think there are some purchasing power on resin if we were bigger, but our first look is, is it a strategic fit for us and that\u2019s what we would be excited to go after.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Lori Chaitman","Thanks, Operator?","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Arun Viswanathan","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to get your thoughts on your confidence level on the volume outlook, you face some tough comps in North America food and Europe food as well. And Brazil, New Zealand, Australia there has been some fits and starts there, maybe there's some stabilization, but what your confidence that you will see some nice organic growth in food care?","William Stiehl","We put that into our guidance. We did \u2013 the North America has been strong, North America has been leading part of food care. We had that tempered gross rate into her guidance on North America. We don\u2019t see that continuing at that rate, but last year's problem is this year's opportunity, so could we get some correction in Latin American and could we get some correction in Europe. So to the guidance just roughly we see tempered volume for us, and tempered on the acceleration of the volume of the fourth quarter and guidance, but we still think we\u2019ll have nice growth from the product lines and specifically food care going into 2018.","Arun Viswanathan","And just follow-up on price, what\u2019s your customers level of acceptance on price increases, are you getting push back, we\u2019re hearing price input cost pressure throughout the chain, so how willing are your customers except that price and has it improved since resin hasn\u2019t gone down as much as you thought? Thanks.","William Stiehl","Okay. Well, I\u2019m a couple months expert in the new industry, but I think since our customers are probably listening to the call right now. I don\u2019t think customers are really excited about raising prices. Matter of fact I\u2019ve already had experiences with -- directly with customers now. So that\u2019s partly why we have to really move and the business does a great job on the value capture. Can we save them more money that simply then is not an issue of price to go cash with that.","Now, as we mentioned that was our input price that our cost were going up, we will raise price. So how I would serve it for the customers living is that we are going to be let down and we want to be at the table. What might be a little bit different going forward is we are going to ask him other questions, because they are going to say for your bag to load our turkey, what\u2019s the price per bag? We might say is there something else in your facility that we can help and save you money. They might be asking us on our Product Care as they would be packaging a product we might say, what are you re-packaging. Can we take some of that cost out and crawl into it?","So we'll be getting price in a little different area. But the direct question with our customers raising price in this environment of course it\u2019s very difficult. We\u2019ll do it on rising cost but we are going to be much more aggressive and creative on helping them to save money and we think we have opportunities to increase our margins in that value capture strategy and that\u2019s what we are going to be going after.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, we have time for one last question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Your line is now open.","Edlain Rodriguez","Thank you. Good morning. Just one follow up on in terms of acquisitions. I mean, are there any regions in the world that\u2019s most attractive to you, like where would you be reinvest in?","Ted Doheny","Good question. We are looking at the regions where we do business. The part of the Fagerdala acquisition that really helped us giving us some presence in the Asia market and that\u2019s because it\u2019s\u2014to help with our cost structure having presence there, that would be attractive to us.","So, but again we want to be the presence where \u2013 in the markets where our customer are, close to our customers does have attractiveness to us. So there is a geographic play and we just have to look at it, specifically don\u2019t want to give any more clarity at things we are looking at, but we want to be next to our customers, we want to be also in adjacencies that we have some new technology that would help us get into markets. So what would the example be?","We are pretty strong in the fresh meat market. We are exploring and getting into more of the seafood market. So, those are some adjacencies that make sense. We had some pretty interesting technology in rigid containers. Can we get more into that space? So we are looking for adjacencies where we have an opportunity that if we can\u2019t make it fast enough, maybe there might be a player or a technology in those attractive spaces, we can buy our way in quicker. But the divining rod that we are using is staying really connected to our technologist. And we are looking at all of our product development, can we accelerate that internally or is there a way to accelerate that faster with an M&A opportunity?","Edlain Rodriguez","And one quick clarification of the share buybacks. Is there a timeframe that you want to complete, what\u2019s left or is it like open-ended?","Ted Doheny","No we typically don\u2019t disclose that as we indicated the guidance assumed 159 million share. We will continue to be active in the market throughout 2018 with our typical methodology that accelerated share repurchase and open market repurchases. But we haven\u2019t indicated a specific timeline at this stage.","Edlain Rodriguez","Okay, thank you.","Lori Chaitman","Operator that concludes our call today. Thank you everybody for joining.

I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, you had the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results. I want to make sure and take a few minutes to highlight our performance and what we expect going forward.","Our first quarter results overall were essentially in line with our expectations. Remember, I told you early February that our first quarter 2016 would be our toughest year-on-year comparable due to currency headwinds, the impact from divestitures and formula pricing in Food Care. This was why we set our first quarter 2016 guidance for sales at $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $245 million with $18 million of currency headwind and $14 million impact from divestitures, and this is about what we have delivered.","The Food Care pricing formulas, which were highly favorable in the first quarter last year, turned unfavorable as predicted. And if there was a surprise, it was lying in the steepness in Venezuela's and Brazil's Food Care volume decline and its related impact on profitability. Having said that, Food Care delivered 4% volume growth in North America, and 3% volume growth in EMEA on an organic basis. Diversey Care increased volume over 4% in both Asia Pacific and Latin America. And Product Care volume was up 6% in EMEA and essentially flat in North America, even with our rationalization efforts and ongoing softness in the industrial sector.","So, we're seeing nice volume growth in targeted regions and for the second consecutive quarter, we have seen robust equipment installment. In the first quarter, equipment sales increased more than 10% in constant dollars and all three divisions had positive growth. Adjusted EBITDA performance was attributable to solid results in our Product Care division, which increased margins 90% basis points (sic) [90 basis points] (04:22) as compared to last year. We also recognized incremental savings from restructuring and demonstrated corporate expense control.","I also told you in February that our performance would improve sequentially throughout the year with an acceleration of growth in the second half. We also said more of our growth would come from volume versus price mix, and I do confirm that this remains our outlook for each of our three businesses, and we are confident in our guidance for the full year.","Looking ahead for Food Care, further global adoption of our innovative solutions, coupled with a well-anticipated up cycle in the North American beef market, along with improving trends in other regions will drive profitable and accelerated growth for the remainder of the year and several years to come. Diversey Care and Product Care have tremendous momentum, thanks to the execution on our Change the Game strategy as does our medical business. And as I mentioned, we have had favorable equipment trends, which is an indication, a strong indication of what's to come.","And before we get into the details of our results, I want to highlight that for the first time since 2010, we announced that the board of directors approved an increase on our quarterly dividend. The dividend was increased by 23% from $0.13 to $0.16. We also repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of our stock valued at $32 million in the first quarter and still have $852 million remaining under our share repurchase program.","Karl Deily, President of our Food Care Division, is joining us today on our call, along with Carol Lowe, our CFO. So with that, let me pass the call to Carol and Karl, and then we'll answer any questions you may have. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Jerome. On slide four of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the first quarter. Let me start with EMEA where we had 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our three divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%, Product Care increased 6%, and Diversey Care increased 1%.","On a by country basis, EMEA was led by positive sales trends in France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Poland and Russia. Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars led by 7% constant dollar sales growth in Diversey Care. Sales in China increased in both Diversey Care and Food Care. India delivered double-digit growth in Diversey Care. Australia and New Zealand combined account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. In Food Care, Australia was essentially unchanged despite slaughter declines of approximately 17%, as cattle farmers initiated rebuilding of their herd. New Zealand was down 6% due to the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market.","Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability, particularly in Venezuela and Brazil. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 19%, which translates into 9% growth in constant dollars. We were pleased to see volume growth in Diversey Care, which was attributable to recent customer wins in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Also, if you exclude Venezuela and Brazil from Food Care results, volume in Latin America would be up 2.5% with strong growth in Mexico and Argentina.","Let's move to slide five and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America was down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price mix offsetting positive volume trends. Food Care's 4% volume growth was offset by formula pricing. As Jerome mentioned, Product Care's volumes were up slightly, but this was offset by unfavorable price mix. As we move through the year, we anticipate volume growth to accelerate for both Food Care and Product Care with customer acceptance of our new portfolios and stronger end market demand.","Diversey Care delivered positive price mix, but it was offset by lower volumes into the distribution channel. Our ERP implementation has gone well; however, there was some timing impact on the quarter. April sales for Diversey Care have been strong and we expect this growth to continue for the remainder of the year.","Turning to slide six, let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales, you can see that we delivered $1.6 billion in sales, a decrease of 9% on an as-reported basis and up 1.5% on an organic basis. Volume contributed $15 million to top line growth and favorable price mix contributed $10 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $113 million, and the impact from divestitures was $67 million.","Adjusted EBITDA was $243 million or 15.3% of net sales. Unfavorable currency translation was $18 million, and the impact from divestitures was $14 million. Operating expenses increased $30 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $16 million and inventory capitalized variances were $12 million. These expenses were partially offset by $14 million in restructuring savings and $5 million from higher volume. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.50 in the first quarter.","Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21% compared to 25% last year, primarily due to our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner and a more favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%.","Let me now turn the call over to Karl to go through our results by division. Karl?","Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care","Thank you, Carol.","Let's turn to slide seven and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price mix. By region, EMEA increased 5%, while North America declined 1%. Latin America was up 10% in constant dollars and Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged. Our adjusted EBITDA was $148 million or 19.3% of net sales. This compares to 21.7% last year and 18.7% last quarter.","If you recall, this time last year, excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, we experienced a significant positive price cost spread due to positive formula pricing and lower input costs. This year, our first quarter results reflect a tough comparable on formulas, the negative impact from Venezuela and Brazil, and the expected slowdown in the Australia and New Zealand business. As Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in absolute dollars on both the top and bottom line in the second quarter and accelerated growth in the second half of the year. For the full year, we continue to forecast organic growth in sales and EBITDA with margin expansion.","I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace that gives us the confidence in our future performance. First, on a global basis, we continue to see customer adoption and further market penetration across all protein sectors in our case-ready platforms. Darfresh on Tray and ready meals continue to gain significant momentum around the world. Second, we are experiencing rapid expansion of our fluid-based solutions, including our vertical pouch packaging, or VPP systems, as well as our aseptic offerings. And third, our customer trials across the globe for our new barrier technology, OptiDure, are going very well.","As for our hygiene business, we are experiencing continued growth with our direct food contact solutions for food safety and our knowledge based-services to optimize water and energy usage.","We also are beginning to see positive impact of the larger herd size in North America, which is resulting in steady increase in cattle coming to market. In Europe, where the protein market is relatively stable, we are experiencing organic sales growth as a result of new product acceptance in Western Europe and increased market penetration in Eastern Europe. We look forward to capitalizing on improving end market demand in both North America and Europe, but keep in mind, our growth in 2016 will be partially offset by a continued slowdown in Australia\/New Zealand and the economic conditions in both Brazil and Venezuela.","So, if we go to slide eight, we'll highlight the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were up just over 1% in the first quarter. We had favorable price mix in every region and 4% to 5% volume growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million was 8.2% of net sales. As a reminder, first quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter and we continue to expect constant dollar sales growth as well as margin expansion for the full year. Also keep in mind, we have continued to invest in disruptive technologies, including specific investments in robotics. We are winning new strategic customers and we have already started servicing those customers this quarter in facility management and food service industries.","Our focus on sustainability, productivity and integration of chemicals, tools and machinery is being recognized throughout the industry. This quarter, from a vertical market perspective, sales increased in food service, retail and in hospitality. We have gained traction with our advanced floor care solutions with the installation of IntelliTrail, the advanced GPS tracking system, on more than 1,100 TASKI machines, and we see rapidly growing demand for our Intellibot portfolio.","Now, let's turn to our Product Care results on slide nine. Product Care's net sales were essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis, with volume growth offset by unfavorable price mix. You may recall that we divested a $15 million product line in North America in January, yet we held volumes relatively flat as compared to last year. This is attributable to our strong position in e-commerce and third-party logistics or the fulfillment market where we continue to experience double-digit growth. We also have been able to maintain good pricing disciplines despite lower input costs, as our customers recognize the value-add of our new and innovative solutions, combined with our global reach and broad product portfolio.","I also want to highlight our business in Europe, where we delivered 6% volume growth in light of ongoing rationalization efforts. Our performance was attributable to the successful integration of our B+ acquisition and the traction we've gained with our automated solutions, including the B+ portfolio, FloWrap, inflatable Bubble and Sealed Air. In the second quarter, we will divest a $12 million product line in Europe, which should complete our product rationalization efforts. For the year, we anticipate top line growth and margin expansion with a stronger second half of the year, given our success in the fulfillment market.","Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Karl.","Turning to slide 10, free cash flow was a use of cash of $48 million in the first quarter. CapEx increased to $52 million as compared to $21 million during the same period a year ago, of which, $15 million was related to our Charlotte campus.","Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $141 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales, based on a 13-month average, is relatively the same since year-end at 14.5%. As compared to a year ago, we improved 106 basis points. We believe there is still opportunity to further improve payables and inventory management, even though we have reached our long-term target of 15%. For the full year, we continue to expect working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million.","Turning to slide 11, we are reaffirming our outlook for 2016. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacted the first quarter. We continue to forecast adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016's EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacted the first quarter. We expect our second quarter results to be down on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to formula pricing in Food Care. However, as Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in every quarter going forward.","Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016 as we continue to invest in our next-generation digital technologies. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be within the range that we previously provided of $2.52 to $2.60. At this point in time, we are not updating our outlook on currency translation. As you know, markets have been extremely volatile and we are focusing on what we can control.","We are on track to achieve our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be $150 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $110 million and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million.","In closing, I would like to once again note that we are confident we are investing in the right markets and in the right region that will enable us to capitalize on future growth opportunities. We are not ignoring the global environment. We have and we will continue to advance continuous improvements and realize further operational efficiency. With our most challenging quarter now behind us, we look forward to delivering improved performance for the balance of the year and in the years ahead.","Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 28. We have invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey care to join Jerome and me for the Q2 call.","Operator, can you please now open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Ghansham.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. So, thinking back to your guidance in February, organic growth of 3.5% for 2016 is what you originally assumed. Just given the start to the year at 1.5%, how should be think about that core growth expectation for the year? Particularly, Jerome, since a lot of the issues you cited, including Food Care weakness in Latin America, and also the Middle East impact on Diversey likely to have some longevity? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good question, Ghansham. We need to go back to what we have guided towards and you'll remember that it is the first time we gave the guidance for a specific quarter. And we did that because we knew what was happening from the pricing coming negative and growth being somewhat muted at the beginning of the year, the divestiture and the currency headwinds. So as far as I'm concerned, really no surprise. The only surprise has been coming from how steep Latin America Food Care has been with 6% volume declines. But this is very specific. It's been very specific as a result of Venezuela which has melted down and as Brazil, which has had \u2013 and Karl will add a little bit in that, which has seen very, very steep local meat consumption reduction and very high prices of meat. And next to that in Latin America, by the way, our Diversey Care business has been very strong, specifically in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and so on.","So we prepared and we said all of that early February, and we are exactly where we said we would be in the end. With regards to the rest of the year, we are going to be talking specifically about the three divisions, but you need to remember that in Product Care to start with, we \u2013 because of the strength and the growth that we have in third-party logistics and e-commerce, we are going to now have \u2013 this division have its very specific seasonality towards Q4. And we are extremely optimistic, thanks to our equipment placement and our customer wins, that we are going to have sequentially, very nice quarters of growth there.","With regard to Diversey Care, we have had some very specific one-offs in North America as a result of channel sales being a little bit muted and ERP implementation consequences as happens to every single company when they go through that experience. But we are verifying and very pleased with what's going on in North America, specifically happy with what's going on in Asia Pacific with renewed nice growth in China for example, strong in India as always, et cetera, et cetera. And therefore, we're pleased with what we're seeing.","In Food Care, I will let Karl speak more specifically about it, but we've got some tailwind coming from the beef cycle. We've got proteins in general doing quite well and we've got very nice innovation. All of this makes me confirm that you are going to see, as I said, already late last year and early this year, we're going to have nice growth \u2013 renewing with nice growth and that this growth is going to be more on volume than it is going to be on price as a result of the resin prices.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Karl?","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Karl, some comments on Food Care?","Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care","Yeah. Just real briefly, I mean, there's no doubt that Venezuela being down almost 59%, Brazil being down 8.5% are ongoing issues. We do see Brazil though not improving immediately, but there is medium to long-term positive trends in Brazil. I mean obviously, the Brazilian animal prices are still at a relatively all-time high. We do see retail prices dropping due to the lack of demand, but we also see their export market having favorable trends occurring. If you remember, one of the reasons Brazil export market was down is they were predominantly exporting to Venezuela and Russia, which had their own unique economic issues, but they've gained access, although, there's some small work yet left to do to gain access to U.S. as an export market.","They're gaining significant business in China as an export market and parts of Asia, somewhat to fill the void left by Australia slaughter being down. So we do believe it's a mid to long-term positive in Brazil. We're also very favorable in the rest of our emerging markets where we have around 5% volume growth. And then we're still very, very positive on our volume growth in North America, 4% and Europe up 3% where we basically have a strategy of growing geographically as well as growing in the mature markets through innovation. So we're still seeing both of those going through.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Carol, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned around the $30 million of higher operating expenses in the quarter. I think you said $16 million of higher wages and salaries; $12 million of \u2013 I couldn't hear it \u2013 capitalized inventory, which doesn't seem to really match up with the $20 million of supply chain and $10 million of SG&A, can you just walk us through that $30 million bucket in more detail, because there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding there? Thanks.","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Yes. Thank you, Scott, and good morning. So the salary inflation of $16 million that I referenced, that covers both for SG&A as well as our supply chain costs of goods sold component. So, for SG&A we had about $7 million in salary wage inflation and cost of goods sold, the salary wage inflation is approximately $9 million and that gets you to the $16 million.","If we look at the $12 million that I referenced on inventory variances, that is largely due to timing relative to capitalized variances that we amortize over our inventory turns and varies from quarter to quarter, year to year, depending on inventory levels, what's capitalized, purchase price variances, efficiencies in the factories. But again, it's largely timing. So again, the two major components are typical compensation inflation that we have every year as well as the inventory variances, of which most is capitalized and then amortized.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the color so far. Maybe if I could just piggyback on Scott's question, Carol, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of what causes the actual inventory variances of $12 million? Just some broad strokes there. And then, Karl, just a quick one for you, what gives you confidence that the cattle cycle will continue to move higher? Because obviously things like weather, feed costs, price of protein, can derail that over time. Thank you.","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. So George, without getting into a lot of detail, on the inventory variances when we reset standards periodically, we have internal guidelines that we follow in terms of when we have changes from our standards by more than a certain percentage, typically using a 10% rule of thumb. That can be impacted within a region or country based on the amount of imports that we're doing. Are they impacted by purchase price variances? Are they impacted by FX transaction costs, which are different than translation costs, as well as the operational efficiencies that impact our indirect supply chain costs, our fixed and administrative costs for running our factories and our warehouses and logistics networks?","So, it's a combination of all of those as we bring them together and looking at the change for inventory values and properly capitalizing the amount, so it's reflected in our inventory turns as we move forward. And on a year-over-year basis, obviously that can be very different depending on where we end one quarter from an inventory level standpoint and efficiencies within that quarter versus comparison to the following year. Karl?","Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care","Okay. George, and thank you for the question, and I'll try to be very brief, but specific. We do have a lot of confidence that the cattle cycle and the herd is continuing to be rebuilt and that additional animals are currently going to market. You are absolutely right. Weather, feed cost, currency, all have an impact; and drought, as it impacts pasture conditions, can significantly have an impact. But corn projections, although up slightly, are still very favorable. The amount of very good pasture conditions are still at a high level.","So currency is still maybe impact some on export, but still the fundamentals are there. The producers are making money. The cow-calf operations are making money and they're still retaining heifers. We don't have a balance of steers and heifers coming to market yet. When you see that, that'll be an indication that they've built the herd as large as they're going to build it. So, we do see them continuing to build the herd. If you go back to what we said at Investor's Day as a baseline, we're right on target. We believe that the herd will continue to be built and that additional animals will come to market over the next three years at a minimum.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess I had a couple of questions on the supply chain costs. I guess would you characterize these as one-time in nature? And what is your outlook for these coming back over the next year or two? And then I guess the other question I had was resin costs, looks like they are going up in Q2. What's your outlook on passing those through? Thanks.","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So of the supply chain costs, there is about $4 million that is a one-time negative we wouldn't see going forward. The other is really based around efficiency, purchase price variances, and that will change quarter-to-quarter depending on how we're operating and demand and performance and again, it's amortized and a lot is driven by where we end with inventory balances of one quarter and how we progress through the next. And because of our global footprint and the impact of currency and everything, it can \u2013 the quarter. It is a timing thing, and usually because our inventory turns about four times within a year, it typically smoothes out over the balance of the full year.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","With regard to resins, yes, we have had in North America resin cost increases. The formula pricings are the formula pricings. We have contracts with our customers based on those, specifically in Food Care, a little bit, not very much in Product Care. And when it is not formula pricing it is a negotiation. So we have seen March increase and April increase. There might be some in May, not necessarily; we'll have to see how this goes. And therefore, we are negotiating on those cost increases with customers every time we can. You know that we've been very sensitive to pricing and we're not in the job of absorbing those things. So that's what we are working on. Now those comes on the heels of some price decreases and therefore we have to be cognizant of all of this. Having said that, we're having actions in that. What do we expect for the rest of the year? We don't think that the volume and the momentum is going to go for additional resin increases at that point in time.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Carol, just a couple of quick ones. On the EBITDA commentary you provided, I believe you said 2Q would be down from a year ago. Can you give us some order of magnitude compared to last year's $308 million? And then just my other question is in terms of the disclosure of the FX drags and organic growth for the company, as a whole, obviously you had been providing that last quarter. You've stopped doing so. Can you give us a reason why? Thank you very much.","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. Thank you, Adam. With respect to the year-over-year decline that we expect for Q2, although expecting growth from Q1 through Q2, it's not very significant, but we want to stay away from giving the quarterly guidance. It was more significant for Q1 and that's why we called it out. I think the focus should be on where our full year guidance is at that we've provided. And with respect to the currency, as I noted, it's very volatile. And we just feel like at this point, some of the upside that we've seen now with the euro, if we look at Latin American currencies as well as the Australian dollar and Canada, they are largely offsetting a lot of the favorability that we're seeing with the euro. So, we'll get into where we're updating this quarter-to-quarter and honestly, we just don't have that much visibility to it.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Having said that, we told you in February \u2013 early February that we are expecting $18 million of negative currency compared to last year and despite a lot of second guessing by lots of people, we have had $17.8 million, so close enough.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you and your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde, of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Is it possible, Karl, for you to give us some sense on sort of a normalized basis about how important Brazil and Venezuela are in your overall Latin American food business? And then also in the Australia\/New Zealand commentary, it sounded like maybe that was a little bit weaker in the first quarter than you were anticipating. Can you give us a little color on that, and what you expect for the balance of the year?","Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care","Yes. And I'll start, Mark, with Australia\/New Zealand first. We saw Australia where their slaughter rates are down, Carol said, 17%. Our sales are relatively flat in that area, so we've also had some depression in the dairy market in New Zealand, so we have two key markets for us that the market conditions are unfavorable, but yet we've kept relatively flat volumes and we did that with diversification, new product innovation, disruptive innovations that have allowed us to grow in a down market.","We would anticipate that the Australian beef market will stay relatively negative for at least two years because they're just starting their herd rebuilding cycle, but they are rebuilding the herd. So again, mid to long-term, we're still very favorable in that segment of the market. So that's some color in Australia\/New Zealand.","In Brazil, obviously Brazil is an important part of our long-range strategy and we think fundamentally with the infrastructure they have in producing food, whether it's poultry, beef and a growing amount pork, that we're well-positioned to capitalize on as those markets recover. We're still heavily entrenched in the key customers in that region and continue to provide automation, new product introductions as well to position ourselves for when their volumes return. Venezuela is the more longer-time concern, and again, they're a nice part of Latin America, but much smaller on the grand scheme of things. So we have great confidence in our total Latin America business where we're still seeing volume growth, minus the two areas of concern, and we believe that Brazil will be tough in the second quarter, but we believe that there is some opportunity to start turning positive in the second half and definitely going forward.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, you see, Venezuela is Venezuela, we all know what's going on. We also know what's going on in Brazil, but the situation is extremely different. What you have is the perfect storm in Brazil. You have had high meat prices, and you read the newspaper like me and therefore, you have had socioeconomical difficulties there and as you combine very high red meat prices and the situation I just talked about, you have had in the first quarter the highest meat consumption decrease that you ever had since statistics have existed in Brazil. So that's what I would call a temporary factor, because at the very same time, you didn't have very much exports, but exports from Brazil meat are going to be improving. And therefore, as the year passes, we believe that situation is going to be improving, both from the meat prices, cattle herd prices, and from the economic situation as there are political anxieties.","So if you exclude Brazil and Venezuela, which it is what it is, you would have seen that we would have solid volume growth in the rest of Latin America, which is very encouraging. So, we're not throwing the baby with the bathwater. We've been very specifically hit in this first quarter. It's not going to be a quick recovery, but the cattle herd is going to be rebuilding in Brazil also and you're going to have some positive effects from Argentina over time as the new government, the Macri government, is going to enable exports. They have started to do this at small levels, but they are going to liberalize meat exports. So, I think all of this is positive.","Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care","Yeah, Mark, they're about 4% of our total Food Care, total Brazil.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. In Product Care, you pointed to I think flattish volumes in North America, despite some of the rationalization activities and weakness in the industrial sector. I was wondering, is it possible to size what the impact of the rationalization was on volumes in the quarter, or what volumes would have been, ex-those activities? And then just the industrial weakness in Product Care, is that something that has gotten maybe better through the three months of the quarter and into April, or gotten worse? Or any kind of color you can give on industrial end-market trends would be helpful.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, on this rationalization, we told you in the first quarter that this was a $15 million rationalization. And therefore, you have it there. So therefore, as you look at our Product Care total business, you're seeing that despite of that we had about flattish sales so we've got \u2013 why don't you take that we've got about $15 million growth in there. The price mix has been a little bit negative, but altogether, we are seeing a lot of momentum. I told you that last year already and that we were going to have it, and we're having it.","We are seeing a lot of interest around the four pillars of fulfillment, velocity, consumer experience, damage control, et cetera, a lot of momentum with customers who are seeing us as creating a lot of value to them through our knowledge-based approach. And when you look at all of this, the cost of the packaging versus the influence it can have on damage and on all the factors and freight reduction because of (47:45), et cetera, because the packaging is really irrelevant. And that's why we're having so much traction helping our customers improve their own situation and create new value out of that.","And just to finish, I have been very positive about the transformation, which has been ongoing in that division, like in all the others by the way. And you are, because it is a faster business than the Diversey Care business, which tends to have long-term contracts, and the Food Care businesses, which tends to have a long cycle for approval of new packaging, it is the kind of business where you're going to be seeing, over time, the quickest improvement.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Jerome. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Phillip Ng of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. If I heard you guys correctly, you are guiding EBITDA down year-over-year in 2Q, which implies guidance is very back-end loaded. That's about a $50 million shortfall you've got to make up in the back half. Outside of volumes, what's driving the improvement? Are you essentially assuming mid single-digit organic growth in the back half and perhaps price costs looking a little better? Thanks.","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, good morning, Phil. It is \u2013 yes, and we acknowledged when we gave guidance back in February that the year was going to largely be driven by performance in the second half. We do have the seasonality that we've noted that's increasing relative to our Product Care business with the e-commerce business and how that drives the whole fulfillment chain. Also, the second half relative to the North America beef cycle and improvements in protein growth overall on a global basis. So it's as we expected, and we're confident with that full year guidance even knowing that most of it's going to happen in the second half of the year.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And our innovation is kicking in. You remember what we told you during our Investor Day in June of last year; we told you that it was we had solid programs and since then from time-to-time I have updated you on a few very key programs which are continue to go better than what we originally told you they would. So we're not going to update you on our Change the Game programs every year and in an Investor Day, but we're going \u2013 during investor meetings, et cetera, we're going to share the progress we're making. We have some really nice things going on right now.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon of Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. And good morning. Just a two-part question quickly, a small one is, I noticed you called out supply chain and SG&A in the year-over-year bridges for EBITDA in two of the segments, but you did not in Product Care, and I just didn't know if there was a reason why that wouldn't apply. And then secondly, I know I think you said originally the FX guidance, I know you're not updating it, was $400 million on the top line for the year, and we're a little bit more than a fourth of the way of that number in the first quarter, but it would seem to me if you froze things today that number in the second quarter would probably be half, and therefore we're probably running at a pace so far that $400 million would not be achieved unless we were to see the dollar reverse and start to rise again. So, your comments on those two points would be appreciated.","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. So Chip, with respect to the question about Product Care and the difference. If you look at the operating expenses, called out on the EBITDA bridge, it was a year-over-year change of $1 million. The difference between the SG&A and the supply chain is very insignificant, so that's the reason we didn't call it out and Product Care wasn't as impacted on the inventory cap variances as Diversey Care and Food Care. And then on the FX, I think we've commented to the extent that we're going to comment on that.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And that question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Jerome, I was wondering if we look at Product Care and the difference between North America and EMEA if you could talk about the markets served, as I would have expected North America to do better than EMEA given the respective economies.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, well, it's true that the U.S. economy, North American economy, is doing better than the European one, but what we're seeing is that there's been quite a few muted investments in quite a few sectors in Europe, and as a result of that, even when the economy just only increases a few decimal points, it is the relativity of the improvements which is important to consider here. What you also have to know is that Europeans tend to automate more their e-Commerce operations than the U.S. has done so far, and the packaging in e-Commerce in Europe is tending to be more sophisticated than the one in the U.S., and this is why we are extremely successful there, and we expect to continue being so.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, I believe we have one or two more questions in the queue, so let's go ahead and squeeze them in if possible. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Just if I could clarify two things; one, Carol, when you referred to earnings being down or flat year-over-year were you referring to EPS or were you referring to EBITDA? That was part one. Part two was I think you talked pretty confidently of the volume getting better as the year progresses, particularly back half of the year, but as you're sitting today, seeing what you have with price mix how are you feeling that component? Could that maybe be negative in 2Q and kind of be flat or only a modest benefit for the year or do you still think that could be 1 point, 1.5 point of benefit?","Carol P. Lowe - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Chris, in terms of my reference to Q2, that our expectations are for it to be down year-over-year, that is specific to the EBITDA number, not to earnings per share. And with respect to the outlook for the balance of the year on price mix, Jerome, did you want to comment on that? Or even, Karl, I guess because that's where we have the most impact from a formula pricing standpoint for Q2.","Karl R. Deily - President, Food Care","So, there's no doubt that in the second quarter we're not out of the woods yet. I think, one of the previous questions on resins going up. I think, a lot will be dictated by what the raw material markets do. As Jerome has said, formulas are formulas, and they're going to be a mathematical solution based on the input costs. But so I think the complete color on the second half will be developing in the next month or two months, but obviously, the comparisons get better year-over-year as the year goes on.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the reason why we're confident in our growth rate for 2016 is once again that we are seeing volume pick up mostly as a result of our innovation and the momentum that we have in the marketplace. The global GDP hasn't moved. Pick your number, 3.2% this year compared to 3.3% or so last year. The IMF reduced the number from 3.4% a few months ago or a quarter ago. That's \u2013 it would be better to have more general economic momentum, but we don't need that given what we have in place. Let me repeat. We have customer wins in Diversey Care as a result of the integration of our equipment, tools and chemicals as a result of our knowledge-based savings introduction and very good, focused work. We're doing that, and by the way, we're seeing this in our pricing. Pricing has been nicely positive this quarter and we expect this to continue.","Product Care, a lot of momentum. A lot of momentum thanks to the technologies once again, the four pillars and such. In Food Care \u2013 and by the way in Product Care in an industrial GDP environment which is pretty tepid, actually. And in Food Care, we talked to you, it's nicer to have slightly the beginning of an upside in the beef, but we're seeing general protein consumption being positive there, but it is not what is going to create the biggest change in our growth in 2016. What is going to create the biggest change in our growth in 2016 is our innovation.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","I think we have one more question. George Staphos had a follow-up.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking it. Jerome or Carol, could you go into why you had relatively weaker sales into distribution for Diversey? If you mentioned it, I missed it. And then contrast that with what was relatively good performance in Latin America for Diversey despite Food being relatively weak there? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. Well, the markets are very different. The regional markets, we were \u2013 we had some good customer momentum in Latin America with some customer wins in Diversey Care and we're happy with the trends and what we're seeing moving better there. With regards to North American Diversey Care, we had a little bit of channel softness as a result of our customers reaching their objectives.","Remember, and by the way, we talked about this; we were \u2013 as we were doing SAP implementation early in the year, in order to make sure that our customers were going to have no disruption, there's been a little bit of pre-buying and we've talked about that during Q4. There's been a little bit of pre-buying towards the end of the year. Well, we've been paying the price in \u2013 during the first quarter, and then every time you have those kinds of changes in the ERP system you have a little bit of disruption. I will be very transparent. If we were not seeing the growth rate that we have enjoyed you have seen how strong our North American business has been last year in that division, I would just go and signal to you that we're seeing different things. We're going to renew was a very nice strength and growth.","Lori C. Chaitman - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator that concludes our call, thank you, everyone, for your questions.","Jerome A. Peribere - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Karl R.

Welcome to the Sealed Air First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. We will have a question-and-answer session later and the instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Now, I would like to welcome and turn the call to Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website, at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review this information in the section entitled, Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors.","Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or at the SEC's website at sec.gov. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we've included in our earnings press release. Included in today's presentation on slide 3 and slide 17, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that complement some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures used throughout the presentation.","In addition, on slide 16, we included a reconciliation of previously reported consolidated results to continuing operations for both Q1 and full year 2016, reflecting Diversey as discontinued operations. In the coming weeks, we will publish key metrics for Q2, Q3 and Q4 2016 continuing operations to help with your 2017 analysis for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, our Medical business was integrated into our Food Care business, which is reflected in our results and outlook.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on our call this morning. And during our prepared remarks, we will cover the announced sale of Diversey, and the use of proceeds and how we will address stranded and unallocated costs. We will review in detail our first quarter results and outlook for continuing operations. We will also highlight Diversey results and after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions.","So, let's get started. On March 27, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Diversey, our Diversey Care division and our related hygiene business to Bain Capital Private Equity for $3.2 billion. The transaction is expected to close early September with net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. This transaction marks a significant milestone for both Sealed Air and Diversey, and we are committed to a timely and successful separation.","For Sealed Air, this transaction will give us an even greater focus on executing our profitable growth story and investing in our core business. The increased financial flexibility will enable us to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while at the same time, target value-added acquisitions. To address the dilutive impact of this transaction, we increased our share repurchase program by an additional $1.5 billion, expanding our total authorization for future repurchases to approximately $2.2 billion. We will continue our quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share and we will pay down approximately $1.1 billion of debt and maintain our credit profile.","In reviewing our first quarter performance for continuing operations, you will see that we had a very solid start of the year. Sales were a $1 billion, an increase of 3% constant dollar growth. Food Care sales of $656 million, had constant dollar growth of 2% and Product Care sales of $377 million, had constant dollar growth of 4%, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization efforts in Europe. We are very pleased to see the execution in North America with constant dollar sales growth of 6% and both Food Care and Product Care contributed to this performance with sales growth of 7% and 3% respectively.","We are also pleased with our EBITDA performance for both Food Care and Product Care. Combined, those two divisions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $216 million or 21% of sales, offset by $34 million in corporate expenses. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $182 million, or 18% of sales. And Carol will provide more details later on the call on corporate expenses, which includes stranded and unallocated costs associated with the sale of Diversey. Diversey, which was recorded in discontinued operations in the first quarter, delivered $582 million in sales, an increase of 2% in constant dollars. And if we did not have discontinued operations accounting, adjusted EBITDA would have been $53 million as compared with $48 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of last year. Our comments throughout the rest of this call will be focused on results from continuing operations.","So let me now turn to slide 5. Our regional performance for Sealed Air. North America accounted for 55% of our net sales, and as I just noted, increased 6% in constant dollars. Latin America, which accounted for 9% of net sales, had constant dollars growth of 5.5%. Mexico, by the way, increased 17% and Brazil was up 5%, which was partially offset by 4% decline in Argentina. On a combined basis, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina accounted for 8% of total company's net sales.","Asia-Pacific represented 15% of net sales and was flat year-over-year with 10% growth in New Zealand and 9% growth in China. Growth in New Zealand and China was offset by the 12% decline in Australia, due to the beef market downcycle. Australia, New Zealand and China combined accounted for 10% of our total company net sales. EMEA, which accounted for the remaining 21% of the total company net sales, was the only region that declined in the quarter, and the 3.5% decline in constant currency was primarily due to timing of Food Care equipment sales, rationalization efforts in Product Care that were completed in May of last year, and a decline in net sales in Russia related to currency because our pricing is indexed to the euro. On an as-reported basis, Russia was slightly up versus last year.","Now turning to slide 6, which highlights volume and price\/mix trends by division and region. You can see from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were up 4% in the first quarter. We delivered over 7% volume growth in North America with 9% volume growth in Food Care and 6% growth in Product Care. I wanted to note that Sealed Air has not delivered volume growth like this since the recovery in 2010 after the great global recession. Volume growth in North America was partially offset by unfavorable price\/mix of 1.7%. In Food Care, unfavorable pricing was due to timing of raw material cost pass-through, which we expect to turn in the second half of the year. And in Product Care, unfavorable mix was impacted by continued growth in e-Commerce and fulfillment. We announced price increases that began in early Q2, which should help top-line going forward.","I also want to note that we experienced positive volume trend in Latin America, led by 2% volume growth in Food Care packaging. This is the first time since the first quarter of 2014 that volume contributed to sales growth in this region. Despite improvement in Q1, the consequences of the selective ban on the Brazilin beef exports is expected to slow down the recovery in this local market and negatively impact our volume in Q2 and Q3. But Latin America continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us. And we expect trends to improve as we head into 2018.","Turning now to slide 7, and review Food Care results in more details. Food Care delivered $656 million in net sales in the first quarter, an increase of approximately 2% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $142 million or margins of 21.6% was impacted by higher input cost. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 2016 was $139 million. The strength we delivered in North America was not only driven by the increased cattle production in the region, but also growth in fresh pork, smoked and processed meats, and cheeses. North America accounted for 51% of Food Care sales in the first quarter. Latin America, which accounted for 13% of Food Care sales delivered positive volume trends for the first time in several quarters, resulting in 5% constant dollar growth. Growth in North America and Latin America was partially offset by continued weakness in Australia as I talked about, and declines in Europe due to timing of equipment sales and Forex in Russia.","First half sales was a strong year for \u2013 first half of 2016 was a strong year for equipment in Europe, resulting in a tough year-on-year comparable in Q1. As we head into the second half, we expect equipment sales to return to growth and the EMEA region accounted for 20% of Food Care net sales, with Asia-Pacific accounting for the remaining 16% of sales. For the full-year 2017, we continue to expect Food Care to deliver 3% constant sales growth with continued strength in North America, improving trends in EMEA, and a more favorable global price\/mix as the year progresses, due to the timing of raw materials cost pass-through in North America.","Slide 8 highlights results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales of $377 million increased 4% in constant dollars, excluding 50 basis points of rationalization in Europe, which happened in end of May of last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million or 19.7% of sales. Performance accelerated through the quarter with all regions delivering positive constant dollar sales and volume growth. North America, which accounted for 62% of Product Care's net sales, increased 3% with strong growth in e-Commerce and fulfillment.","EMEA accounted for 23% of sales, and increased slightly, driven by high single-digit growth in Germany, offset by flat sales in the UK and declines in France, largely related to the rationalization I've referred to. Asia-Pacific and Latin America combined accounted for the remaining 15% of sales and were up nearly 10% led by strength in China, Japan and Mexico. We continue to grow alongside the rapidly expanding e-Commerce and fulfillment market, and see good areas of stabilization within the industrial sectors. Our new products including B+, FloWrap, StealthWrap, Inflatable Bubble and Automated Mailers are also gaining momentum, across all of our end markets as our customers focus on addressing dimensional weight pricing.","We expect our automated fulfillment solutions to continue ramping throughout the year and further contribute to our performance. It is worth highlighting that last week we announced with UPS, the opening of a Packaging Innovation Center in Louisville, Kentucky, on the UPS largest Supply Chain Solutions site. We were honored to be selected as UPS partner to help address their customers' packaging and shipping challenges. And this clearly demonstrates the power of our innovative solutions and the ability for UPS and Sealed Air to collaboratively work together to add value to customers around the world.","For the full 2017, we expect the momentum we experienced in the first quarter to continue throughout the rest of the year, resulting in constant dollar sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. Growth within our e-Commerce and fulfillment segment is far surpassing industrial growth.","And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and our outlook for the full year. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide 9, let me walk you through our net sales from continuing operations on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1 billion in net sales in the first quarter. Volume contributed $38 million and was partially offset by unfavorable price\/mix of $11 million. Jerome has already provided color on our top-line trends. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $182 million. Volume growth contributed $17 million in Q1. Mix and price\/cost spread was $12 million unfavorable. Operating expenses increased $5 million and restructuring savings were $1 million. Currency had an unfavorable impact on adjusted EBITDA of $2 million.","You can also see on the bridge that we disclose the unallocated costs as a separate item, which were $8 million in the first quarter 2017 as compared to $5 million in the first quarter 2016. I will expand on this further when we discuss the 2017 full year guidance. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.43 in the first quarter compared to $0.42 in Q1 2016.","Our adjusted tax rate for continuing operations in Q1 2017 was 14% compared to 19% in Q1 2016. The adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was favorably impacted by a tax benefit on share-based compensation and benefits related to statute of limitations, expirations and audit settlements.","Turning to slide 10, we are presenting our free cash flow on a consolidated basis, which includes results from continuing and discontinued operations. In the first quarter, consolidated free cash flow excluding payments related to the Diversey sale was a use of cash of $31 million. CapEx was $50 million. Cash interest payments $48 million. And restructuring costs were $15 million. Aligned with our typical free cash flow seasonality, working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $115 million.","Now turning to our outlook on slide 11. Net sales from continuing operations for 2017 are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion, an increase of over 3% on a constant dollar basis. This forecast assumes approximately 3% constant dollar growth for Food Care and 3% to 4% for Product Care. We expect growth to be driven largely by volume in both businesses. We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $35 million. For continuing operations, our major currency exposures include: the euro, which was approximately 13% of net sales in Q1; the Australian dollar at 5%; British pound 4%; and the Mexican peso, New Zealand dollar and Brazilian real, each were approximately 3% of net sales.","2017 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is expected to be approximately $825 million. Corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $130 million in 2017, which includes $25 million of unallocated costs related to discontinued operations accounting. These unallocated costs consists of functional support and related expenses previously allocated to Diversey Care and hygiene solutions that did not qualify for discontinued operations. Our goal is to eliminate most of the unallocated costs by the end of 2018. Corporate expenses also include approximately $40 million of stranded costs. Identification of stranded cost is based on a percent of net sales. With a divestiture of this size, we recognize that we need to reduce the size of our corporate expense structure.","We will be making a concerted effort to reduce stranded costs by 50% and repurpose the balance to support growth initiative. This reduction is planned for the 24-month period following the close of the transaction. Keep in mind that once the transaction closes in September, we will start supporting Diversey through our transition services agreement for up to 12 months to 18 months. We expect to receive approximately $23 million in TSA revenues during this period, which will largely offset the unallocated costs and favorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $5 million.","Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $195 million, with the assumption that we pay down $1.1 billion of debt with the net proceeds of the Diversey sale. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $165 million. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 28% for the full year of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.70. Our forecast for EPS is based on the current weighted average shares outstanding of 196 million. Keep in mind that we are no longer restricted on share buybacks, and to address dilution of the sale of Diversey, we will begin buying shares through open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. We expect to fund the repurchase program with cash flow generation and net proceeds from the sale of Diversey.","Let's turn to slide 12 and review our outlook for free cash flow. To calculate our free cash flow outlook, our forecast is based on our estimated full-year outlook for continuing operations and only the first eight months of discontinued operations. Let me walk you through how we estimate our free cash flow for the year. We started with an estimated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, with $825 million of expected EBITDA from continuing operations and $215 million from the first eight months of discontinued operations, assuming an early September close.","We anticipate cash interest payments to be $200 million, and cash tax payments to be $160 million. Restructuring cash costs, excluding efforts dedicated to reducing unallocated and stranded costs, are estimated to be $50 million. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $175 million of which $165 million represent Sealed Air continuing operations' expenditures. Restructuring-related CapEx is expected to be $25 million in 2017, and is included in the $175 million CapEx estimates. Working capital and other assets and liabilities is expected to be a use of cash at $65 million. As you know, our free cash flow is typically generated in the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for cash generation and that is especially true of the Diversey business. With these factors in mind, our forecast for free cash flow in 2017 is approximately $390 million, excluding cash payments related to the sale of Diversey.","Looking beyond 2017, our targeted adjusted EBITDA conversion to free cash flow for continuing operations is 50%-plus. I would like to discuss the gross and net proceeds of the sale as highlighted on slide 13. Bain Capital is acquiring Diversey in an all cash transaction valued at $3.2 billion. We expect to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion. Cash taxes are expected to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million. The pension liability transferring with Diversey is approximately $200 million and transaction fees and separation costs are anticipated to be $70 million. Restructuring costs to address unallocated and stranded costs are estimated to be $50 million. The remaining balance includes the other costs and debt-like obligations.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Before we open the call for to questions, I would like to remind you our second quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, August the 3rd.","With that, operator, can you please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good. Good morning.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Just trying to get a better sense of what the free cash flow profile is for the company excluding Diversey and relative to the $390 million you are guiding towards for 2017, what kind of free cash flow will the new Sealed Air generate in 2018 and beyond and what are some of the parameters like CapEx, cash restructuring, cash tax and working capital going to look like going forward?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, we're not prepared to give a number for 2018. We've referenced in my comments to the 50% free cash flow conversion rate that we will be moving to. With respect to CapEx a more normalized basis for us would be approximately $150 million to $160 million and that assumes plenty of room for us to invest for growth, because our maintenance CapEx is somewhere around $100 million for the company. So, any other questions?","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. And, I guess, what's driving the large swing in working capital for this year. I think it was supposed to be an $80 million source before and now it's a $65 million use of cash. Any details around that would be helpful?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, it's largely because of the sale of Diversey. As I noted, we are heavy in our free cash flow generation in the second half of the year and that is very true for Diversey. Actually, the bulk of their free cash flow is generated within Q4. So, most of the delta from the guidance that we provided before to the update for working capital and other is largely driven because of the current planned close date for the transaction in early September.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","And also, your question about the restructuring, just to make sure we have clarity there, we had previously guided $85 million to $100 million in restructuring for 2017. As you see, we now have restructuring for continuing operations excluding anything associated with the separation at $50 million and you also see, as we highlighted in the deck, that we have $50 million identified for restructuring associated with addressing stranded costs. So, those two together, we are still within our $85 million to $100 million for 2017, although on the high end. We expect that the $50 million for the restructuring associated with stranded cost, that will actually spread mostly from Q4 and then into 2018 as we address those stranded costs.","Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just so we all are on the same page, can you bridge the $825 million EBITDA guidance for continuing operations versus the number you had before, like last year at the end of the fourth quarter, which I believe was closer to $860 million, $865 million. I mean, you've talked about the stranded costs, but you lowered the negative impact from currency. Like what's like the delta? Like what got worse versus what you were looking at, at the end of last year?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, actually, we wouldn't say that there's a lot worse than at the end of last year. We've highlighted that some of the mix with Product Care, and Jerome can comment more on that, just as we continue to grow at a faster rate within our e-Commence and fulfillment does have some impact, however, we're seeing nice performance from Food Care and from Product Care top line, and unallocated costs of $25 million also was key in that bridge as well.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So there is something that you need to understand is the SEC rules with regards to unallocated costs before closing. And unless a given unallocated cost is very precisely put into a division, call it computers and cell phones, there is a cost for computers and cell phone for example which is very clearly set into the Diversey operation. But if it is a cost which is allocated as a percentage of sales or things like this, before closing, all of those costs move to Sealed Air to new Sealed Air, and that is probably part of this explanation and we have talked about $25 million of those costs, which in fact are moved to \u2013 into our accounting, since they're new to their accounting, and you're going to have \u2013 you're going to see those after closing being offset by GSAs (31:48).","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And one last one. In terms of like Product Care, so how do you address the margin issue where e-Commerce sales no doubt are growing, but they tend to have lower margins in industrial sales, which are declining, and so how do you make up for that margin?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So that's a very good question. We don't have a margin issue as you said, with Product Care because actually we're really very happy with the restoration of margin in that division that we have carried throughout the years. But what you have seen is that we have actually \u2013 what we have not seen, but what we have had is somewhat flat pricing, but a negative price\/mix and you have seen that for the year we said that we're going to have 3% to 4% constant dollar sales growth.","The reality in the gross profit line is that we're seeing a slight degradation in the first quarter and it's going to be impacting also the second quarter because we have had hefty resin price increases, which we have not been able to immediately offset with our own price increases, which we have started. So we already are seeing some price increase \u2013 slight price increase in the first quarter which is going to continue in the second quarter but that's one part. One part is the slight margin compression that all of our competitors have had in food packaging and in product packaging and things like this because of the speed and how hefty those resin cost increases have been.","The second thing is the mix. And in Product Care, we are growing as we already told you in the previous quarters, much faster in e-Commerce and fulfillment than in our industrial packaging. By the way, our industrial packaging is doing much better than it has done. We are seeing some lift, we're seeing some restoration of volume which is very pleasant to see in an industrial GDP, which is still not very good, but we're seeing this.","But what is important to understand is that yes we do have some lower value-added products temporarily in e-Commerce, but we also have and you need to remember that, have launched an equipment line. Two years ago, we didn't have any equipment product. We have at Pack Expo last October shown our new line of equipments and those are starting to ramp up. You can imagine that when your production starts to ramp up, you have lower margins because you'll have to absorb volume variances in your plants and we are by far not at the margins we need to be in our equipment. But this is the nature of the beast. You ramp up your equipment and when those are going to start kicking with sizeable volume and we're doing \u2013 we have a lot of momentum in that sector. We are going to improve our margin. This is why and I'm concluding with this, this is why I said that short-term our margins in e-Commerce 3PL are lower than our total margin, but this is not going to be the case over time.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, can we take the next \u2013 Thanks, Edlain. Operator, can we take the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi everyone, good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Hi George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate all the details. I want to come back to the question of performance relative to guidance, if we \u2013 and let's take it from a prior, pre-Diversey being discontinued operations basis, which will then get away from that accounting as you were talking about, Jerome. So I think prior guidance you were looking for about a $1.180 billion in EBITDA and if I talk the $825 million of continuing operations and I gross up the $215 million for full year, I'll wind up at around $1.150 billion. We also have currency which seems like it's been less negative, which is a good thing and volume trends have been at least as good it would appear as you would have been expecting. So if you agree with the premise of everything I just set up, there does appear to be some difference in what you were guiding to in terms of what you are seeing right now, what would cause that?","And then my second question and then I will turn it over. Jerome, you have done a great job of driving margin in part by getting fair value for your products in the market relative to what they are to their customers, do you feel you have much more upside in that regard either in Product Care or Food Care in terms of again getting that fair value, that fair price for the value project customers or if you largely accomplished that at this juncture. Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, George one thing to note, I'm not sure because we don't breakout guidance for each of these segments and businesses and depending on what the assumption was for hygiene, that could potentially be contributing to some of the disconnect. We did provide on slide 16 of the deck what hygiene's performance was for the full-year 2016, as well as for Q1. We have had growth within the hygiene business year-over-year for 2017. And so depending on your assumptions for that, that could be causing part of the disconnect with the guidance, looking back at it. The other thing...","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But Carol, presumably that would be in the $1.180 billion?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, please go ahead. I apologize.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","No, I'm sorry, George, okay. So if you are looking at the total \u2013 the other thing is on some of the formula pricing in that pass through, we did have slightly higher than expected increases that we will make up in the second half of the year. So, there's a little bit of that but whereas previously we have said resins would be approximately flat for the year. They will be up slightly on a full-year basis. And so \u2013 that's timing due to the pass through. So we'll see that as well.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, yeah...","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for that.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","....in regards to our cost increases, once again, remember the cost increases, that was $0.05 in February, it was $0.03 in March, the $0.03 of April in resins has been moved to May, and we'll see if it goes through et cetera. So, yes we have been negatively impacted on the gross profit line on both divisions; one because of formula pass through, the other one because of negotiations and it is going to impact also Product Care and also Food Care in the second quarter before we see a restoration. But what you have to be sensitive also with regards to the currency, and yes indeed, the currency impact is less, but remember who it affects most. It is the Diversey side because they have a higher exposure to non-U.S. dollar than the rest of new Sealed Air.","Having said that, no, we don't see a deterioration of our forecast when you compare apples-with-apples. We expect continued gross profit squeeze in the second quarter because of the reasons that I talked to you about.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And on the March to get fair value for all your products, Jerome? Thank you.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","On the second comment, which is also a very good question, remember what I said several years ago, there is a catch-up to do. So, therefore, the margin increase is going to slow except for the new products and you remember that in Food Care and in Product Care, we have been moving with innovation which is \u2013 which are really doing well. We are going to update you all during our Analyst Day next autumn about this. And as a result of that we believe that we are going to be able to continue to have margin expansion. The solutions that we are bringing, adding new value to customers have a very quick and very strong payback for our customers. So, we're really pleased with our innovation.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, can we go to the next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Hi, Scott.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I had a follow-up on a couple of George's questions because I've got a very similar math to him on the RemainCo, if you want to call it that, EBITDA guidance of $825 million. Maybe to just ask a little bit more straightforward, are you seeing a reduction in your EBITDA guidance for the Food Care, Product care, RemainCo business and if not, maybe you just built in some conservatism into that forecast on a go-forward basis given all the moving parts?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, our forecast is our forecast. What we have seen, as I said before, is margins squeezed in the Product Care. We used to see the sales growth move into the EBITDA and more and we are not seeing this in Product Care for the reasons I have talked about. And therefore for the full year, we're not seeing and we're not expecting to have product care have the sales growth dropped to the bottom line and more. And the reasons once again are hefty and quick resin increases and the product mix with regards to our equipment in our lower value-add products into the e-Commerce. So that's one.","The second one is that we are \u2013 in Food Care, we're seeing growth and we're satisfied with what's going on in there, and we're not seeing the major EBITDA contraction or lower growth than you were expecting. Once again, remember what I said before, the ATC (43:59) accounting principles oblige us to take all of those non-directly attributable allocated costs that we have before closing into Diversey. They have to come to new Sealed Air that is having an impact.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just a follow-up on the resin price increases on Food Care, I thought I heard you say \u2013 I'm sorry, Product Care. I thought I heard you say pricing was impacted by some negotiations and then in Food Care anything that you can do to maybe tighten the pass through on those resin price increases. I think, you said you weren't going to get it back until the second half of the year? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So now you don't tighten because those pass-throughs because those are contracts and therefore you respect the contracts. But what goes around comes around and as a result this at the point in time, we're going to start to benefit from those and we believe that this is going to be towards the end of the year and definitely into next year.","With regards to Product Care, those are negotiations because we don't have basically formulas and that has affected some gross profits in the first quarter because of the speed of those $0.05 and $0.03 and potentially some more to come. We have announced price increases on \u2013 and we have executed on price increases based on resins. We also had some benzene and MDI, very hefty price cost increases, and we have already started to implement price increases on our \u2013 Instapak product line which is important.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Scott. Does that cover it?","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","It does. Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Great. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Your line is open.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, thanks, guys. I just wanted to go back to the plan going forward. So, we'll be losing the Diversey EBITDA, you talked about share buyback and an accelerated share repurchase program and some debt pay down and M&A. Maybe you can just help us understand how you bridge the dilution? Because we're getting quite a bit of that in expenses (46:24). How do you see that bridge playing out over the next 12 to 18 months?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, on the dilution, I made the comment that we would cover part of it through the net proceeds, approximately if we utilize $1.1 billion and then we utilize free cash flow generation, it's approximately $1.8 billion depending on the price of the stock, to get us to a net neutral position for the separation of the Diversey business. And we will put in place open market purchases as well as an accelerated share repurchase program, and our goal again is to neutralize by the end of 2018.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And what about M&A. I imagine that some proceeds could be used in that. Is that correct and what are you seeing in the pipeline if so? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, yes, M&A can be part of the game. I've been very public saying that we have been doing technology bolt-ons in the past and we're going to continue looking at bolt-on operations. So therefore there is no huge M&A being discussed or being looked at at this point in time. We believe that we can do a regional bolt-on to reinforce our Product Care and our Food Care divisions.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to zero-in on the corporate expense line for a minute. Lot of moving pieces there. As I understand it, I guess you had $25 million of unallocated expenses in there. I think you made some comments that $23 million of that would get covered by some transition service agreements once the sale closes and then eventually you hope to take out half of the $40 million of stranded costs, so is it right way to think of it as a negative $130 million this year going to something like a negative $110 million next year? And I know that's not all corporate, there's some spending on growth initiatives in there. Any thoughts on changing the cadence of some of that spending and maybe pushing it out a little bit to offset some of the dilution from the sale and some of the impact from the stranded costs.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, you are thinking about the math the correct way, so the $130 million includes the $25 million of unallocated, and not to delve into technical Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, but just to note that all those costs are, they are shift from discontinued to continuing operations, because the accounting rules are very specific, that unless something can be identified as a discrete cost, it can't sit in discontinued operations. So we have to pull it up into continuing operations, that's why we've called it out. That will be the easiest part of the cost to exit. They will firstly largely be covered by approximately $23 million in transition service agreement proceeds, over those agreements they vary across all of the work stream, some last 6 months, some are 12, some can go up to 18 months, that they should largely cover that $25 million.","Then in addition to that, I highlighted the $40 million, which we will work to exit 50% of that, beginning at the close date and estimate it will probably take approximately 24 months to exit those costs. And we have included in that $50 million in the restructuring to get to the net proceeds for the sale of the business to cover the exit of those costs.","If we don't have the growth to be able to cover that $20 million, that we're saying, we're not exiting, obviously we will have to take actions to address more than the $20 million, because our goal is to continue to have quality of earnings via EBITDA growth as we see top-line growth. It always doesn't happen smoothly one-for-one depending on, if we're growing in a certain sector and making investments such as with the e-Commerce and fulfillment markets where we're growing rapidly there, but we do plan to have year-over-year.","Also, if we look at either our corporate expenses or what we're investing within the businesses, Jerome has created a culture here, it is still there, and we will continue to manage that way. We have to earn the right to grow, and earn the right to be able to spend and invest. And it's at the performance of the business level or in total for the company. If we're not seeing that growth and that improvement in performance, we will very aggressively manage the cost.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Having said that, you have observed I hope the dramatic shift in our volume growth. And that helps me to come back and say and remind all of what I said last year. Last year, I said that we were expecting to have a total growth of about 3%, which we did not deliver, but I was expecting this to be \u2013 the growth of last year to be ramping up towards the end of the year. So, when you step back what are you seeing? You're seeing that basically I was wrong by one to two quarters maximum, and I do confirm that I am expecting to see the volume growth and the total growth to firm up because we said 3% to 4% this year, and when you look at specifically to the volume, we have had this past quarter, about the double growth that we have had for a long time because our volume growth in New Sealed Air has been of about 0.8% to 0.7% in the first three quarters of last year, and about 2% in the fourth quarter, so what you're seeing that this growth has picked up. So, Q4 volume growth for New Sealed Air was 2%. Q1 volume growth for the first quarter was 3.8% and I do confirm that this is a very good and positive trend, which is making me very confident that our strategy was and is the right one, innovation and segmentation is the name of the game. And next to that we're going to see how it develops into 2018, but altogether we believe that this 3% to 4% growth in 2017 is going to be coming, which is the major change compared to the past.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Thanks for that. I think no one disputes the volume growth. I think it's just some of the translation of that to the bottom-line getting offset by some of the OpEx spending and the corporate has been just a little bit frustrating, so hoping to see a little bit more of that drop to the bottom line going forward. Just one on the Food Care...","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Not more frustrating than for us by the way, but this is a transition time. It is a difficult time in 2017. We have done what we felt was necessary to be done for the future of Sealed Air. This Diversey has earned the right to fly from its own wings with Bain Capital right now, and I think this is good for Sealed Air and that this is good for Diversey. And on the Product Care, having the sales growth not dropping to the bottom line, fully agree with you, we believe that this is transitional also, but it's going to be there in 2017.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Appreciate that. I just had one on Food Care and that was the price\/mix was down, even the resins are up and I think the U.S. was a bigger contributor to the mix, but I thought they would have had a higher price point. Just wondering are you seeing any competition pick up there that's leading you to have to cut any like versus like pricing above and beyond just the raw pass-throughs and may be just help us understand what was driving the price\/mix to be down there?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","I'm a very strong believer that you do not buy your way into markets with price, and I have proven that over the past few years. What is making us win in the marketplace is our innovation, it is not only on red fresh meat, it is also on cheese, it is also on processed foods, we have customers who are converting to Grip & Tear solutions, we are making progress with OptiDure as we were expecting, we're making progress with our DOT as we were expecting.","So I would say all good and this is what enables us to have the volume moves that we're having. Mostly what we're seeing is, price in the first quarter mostly North America because of the formula pricing. It's mostly a timing point situation.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, I think we have time for one or two more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Carol just a two-part question on the dilution. So, if your buyback call it $1.8 billion, let's call it 40 million shares, so the $1.70 just by my math would go $2.15. So to get back to $2.60 would seem to require quite a bit of EBITDA growth. I'm just wondering how much of that would come from the stranded cost\/unallocated cost going away? How much needs to go to get to neutral on earnings by the end of next year? That's my first question.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","So, we would assume again that all of the unallocated is addressed by the end of 2018, so that full 25 million. And the 20 million of the 40 million, we would address that beginning at the date of separation and estimate that it will take approximately 24 months, cost will exit each and every quarter. And the timing of that length to be variable. But our assumptions and assume that we would exit the 25 million plus the 20 million within 24 months of the close, but the biggest portion of it being exited by the end of 2018.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And are you assuming organic growth on top of that growth?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes, we are assuming organic growth for EBITDA.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just last question on the buyback, Carol. Can you just talk about the timing of it and the extent to which you intend to lever up to buy back stock before the deal closes? Thank you very much.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. So, Adam, we'll be out of our blackout now that we've had our earnings release and shared this information. We'll file our 10-Q by tomorrow at the latest, so which we'll just have all the numbers that we've presented within our earnings release. So we'll be out of the blackout, so we can be back in the market at any time, prior to going back into blackout for the Q2 earnings and we'll have to put plans in place before that to be active through that entire time period and up until the earnings release for Q2. So, we internally we've talked about what numbers make sense, as always we'll stick to the discipline we've had where we run models, we look at an intrinsic value for the stock, we review the models with the board and those ranges and we'll continue to do so as we go forward. We ended Q1 right around 3.5 times leverage, we will stick to our commitment of 3.5 times to 4 times leverage and we feel very comfortable with the amount that we will be buying in Q2 and Q3 even without a close of the Diversey transaction. While we don't see any risk to the transaction at all, we will be very prudent in how we buy the stock back.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, Carol.","Lori C.

","Now turn the call over to Jerome Peribere our President and CEO. Jerome.","Jerome Peribere","Thank you Lori and good morning everyone. We have definitely a lot to cover on our call today in addition to our review of our third quarter results and outlook, we will be discussing the announcement that we made on October 17 to pursue a tax free spin off of Diversey Care and our related hygiene business. As planned, we have Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division, joining Carol for our third quarter discussion, and I also invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care and Karl Deily, President of Food Care to join us during this important Q&A session. Let me get started."," In the third quarter we reported $304 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales of $1.7 billion. Our margin increased cash flow performance in the quarter is a testament to our strong operational discipline and working capital management despite soft organic sales growth of 1%. We're pleased to report adjusted EBITDA margins of 17.7% or 50 basis points improvement over last year. And we generated $212 million of free cash flow during Q3 as compared with $191 million for the same quarter last year. I will provide a few comments and then give this to Carol and Ken.","Our price mix discipline came through in the quarter with all regions delivering favorable trends except North America primarily due to timing of raw materials cost [Indiscernible] in Food Care. Let me highlight volume growth which was largely driven by our execution of our changed again strategy. Product Care volumes in North America were up 7% if you exclude the 100 basis points of rationalization. Diversey Care delivered positive volume in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific as a result of customer wins, and Food Care protein packaging volumes were led by more than 5% growth in North America and positive trends in the EMEA region. These positive volume trends are very important to us as they are strong indications of what is to come into year end and in 2017.","Unfortunately our business suffered from some softness in Latin America, Middle East, and Australia and continued weakness in the general industrial GDP. You can see that we have and will continue to take corrective actions to preserve our bottom line guidance and commit to our free cash flow in 2017. Such agility is now in our DNA. ","With that said let me turn back to our decision to pursue the tax free spin of Diversey. By separating our Food Care, Product Care, and medical business from our Diversey Care and related hygiene business we create two pure play industry leading companies with strong financial profiles, each with its own unique and compelling investment opportunity. We believe that this is the appropriate next step in our Company's transformation and will accelerate profitable growth for both entities.","Before I get into the rationale, I will quickly highlight the structure of the transaction on slide 5. Following completion of the tax free spin, Sealed Air shareholders will own 100% of the common stock of what I would call New Diversey. Both New Sealed Air and New Diversey will be well capitalized with disciplined return based approaches to capital allocation.","We anticipate a similar credit rating to existing Sealed Air as both companies. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017 and we anticipate timing of the form ten as early as the first quarter of 2017, which will provide you with independent standalone financials for New Diversey. ","So now let's turn to slide 6. Where we highlight the strategic rationale for the separation. This separation will give both entities the ability to tailor the strategic objectives and capitalize on global growth opportunities both at the core of their businesses and with respect to innovative and disruptive technologies. New Sealed Air and New Diversey will have leaner and more streamlined operations and will become even more entrepreneurial. I want to spend a few minutes highlighting both New Sealed Air and New Diversey.","First New Sealed Air on slide 7. Many of you have heard me say this before, but I will say it again. We believe that our Food Care and Product Care divisions are by far the most innovative leaders in their respective industries with unmatched global scale and reach. In short we are market makers.","Over the last three plus years we extended this leadership globally with new innovative product offerings and consultative services. Adjusted EBITDA for our Food Care division, excluding the hygiene business and our Product Care division, has reported a three year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11% in constant dollars.","To give you a sense of the size and the margin profile on an as reported basis, the adjusted EBITDA margin for New Sealed Air reported approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margins in the last 12 months ending September 30, 2016. ","New Sealed Air will continue to generate strong free cash flow which will support future growth initiatives and value-added M&A. And consistently return value to shareholders.","Let me turn to Slide 8 on New Diversey. Under the Sealed Air umbrella both Diversey Care and our hygiene business streamline their organizations, revamp their product portfolio and go-to-market strategy, reenergize energy with a renewed focus on disruptive solutions, and embrace a truly entrepreneurial culture which makes them be the most innovative player in the industry. All of which have contributed to consistent top-line growth what will make the New Diversey and has generated a three-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15% in adjusted EBITDA on a constant-dollar basis.","Our innovative platforms including the Internet of Things, Intellibot robotics, clean-in-place solutions, biodegradable chemistry, dry lube and others, are enabling us to win new customers around the world. And in a separate announcement you saw that our branded licensing agreement with SCJ will expire in May 2017. We have already started working on developing new partnerships as announced yesterday morning with Spectrum and Nacoma. We will also look for opportunities to expand existing relationships and grow our own brand into new channels.","Given the low capital requirements and free cash flow generation, New Diversey will have the flexibility to invest in growth and return value to shareholders. In short, you have in Sealed Air what a renowned industry analyst once called the ATM you want to own. Now you will have two ATM machines. With that, let me now turn the call to Carol for a look at the financial results for the third quarter. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 9 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the third quarter. The two regions that deliver constant-dollar sales growth were North America and Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume with positive trends across our three divisions. In Latin America, constant-dollar growth was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations.","In EMEA positive trends in Food Care were offset by declines in Diversey Care and Product Care. Performance in Asia-Pacific was primarily impacted by a 14% decline in Australia. The Australian beef market is significantly depressed with slaughter rates at their lowest levels in 20 years. Australia accounts for approximately 6% of Food Care's net sales.","Turning to Slide 10, we highlight volume and price mix trends by division and by region. We have already highlighted key volume trends, so I will focus my comments on price mix. You can see from this slide that with the exception of North America, we have had positive price mix in all regions for three consecutive quarters.","Food Care's price mix was positive on a global basis, despite North America being negatively impacted by the timing of raw material pass-throughs. Diversey Care delivered favorable price mix across all regions which has been consistent throughout the years. In Product Care, strong e-commerce volumes are currently having a negative impact on mix.","Turning to slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year over year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales on essentially flat volume. Price mix contributed $15 million to top line growth. Unfavorable currency translation was $31 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. ","Now turning to slide 12, we present our adjusted EBITDA bridge. I would like to note that our adjusted gross margin improved 90 basis points from 36.4% in Q3 2015 to 37.3% in Q3 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price cost spread was $22 million favorable and we realized $10 million in restructuring savings. Operating expenses had an impact of $21 million of which salary and wage inflation was $17 million.","Currency was a negative $4 million and divestitures were $3 million. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the third quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. We repurchased 3.5 million shares for approximately $165 million and exited the third quarter with 194 million shares outstanding. ","Let me now turn the call over to Ken to go through our results by division.","Ken Chrisman","Thank you Carol. Slide 13 highlights the results from our Product Care division. Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were unchanged on a year over year basis. Rationalization efforts in North America and Europe had a negative impact on constant dollar sales of approximately 200 basis points. We reported a record level of EBITDA margin of nearly 23%, an increase of 160 basis points, which is notable given the raw material environment and a soft industrial sector. ","As you heard from both Jerome and Carol, our third quarter sales performance was due to strength in ecommerce and fulfillment. We delivered nearly 4% sales growth in North America adjusted for rationalization. North America accounts for approximately 60% of Product Care's total sales. Volume accelerated throughout the quarter and we continue to see good growth in October.","Our thought leadership in providing solutions to ecommerce and fulfillment sectors is resulting in accelerated adoption of our more profitable differentiated innovations, including inflatable bubble, core view, and B+ equipment, complemented by record levels of equipment installations. We're also seeing expanded adoption of our protective mailers as customers respond to dimensional weight and pricing challenges.","Adding into yearend, we expect growth in e-commerce and fulfillment to accelerate and drive top- and bottom-line performance. Our robust equipment installations fueled by our new offerings give us confidence in achieving accelerated growth. While we're not seeing much of a rebound from the industrial sector, our customers in this sector are expressing increased interest in our new offerings as they address the impact of dimensional weight and pricing.","Let's turn now to Slide 14 and review Food Care results. Favorable price mix, positive volume trends in North America and Europe, and disciplined cost management were key contributors to sales and EBITDA performance in the third quarter. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% on 1% sales growth. EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to just over 21%. Production of all proteins in North America and Europe were up in the third quarter.","On one hand, our business is reaping the benefits of higher beef volumes and continued global adoption of our new products. On the other hand, these positive trends are being offset by the challenging business environments in Asia-Pacific, particularly in Australia as Carol mentioned, and Latin America which took a turn for the worse in September after trends appeared to be stabilizing. In the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement in sales and adjusted EBITDA, with accelerating volume trends in North America and Europe offsetting continued weakness in Australia and Latin America.","Let's turn to Diversey Care results on Slide 15. Diversey Care net sales were up 1.5% in constant dollars and adjusted EBITDA margins were 13%. Growth in the quarter was driven by new-customer rollouts in North America and Europe, and positive trends in Asia-Pacific. We were pleased to see North America deliver growth in light of a tough comparable. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant-dollar sales growth, and in Asia-Pacific growth was led by strength in China and India.","These positive trends were partially offset by declines in the Middle East. As we anticipated, the hospitality sector, particularly in Turkey, continues to struggle as a result of significant declines in tourism and occupancy rates. For the fourth quarter, we expect a positive trend in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific to continue and more than offset challenges in Latin America and Middle East. Customer rollouts are on schedule and our listing strategic wins across all sectors continues to grow.","Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Ken. Turning to Slide 16, free cash flow was a source of cash of $280 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $82 million for the nine months ended September 30. CapEx increased to $190 million which includes $71 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus, and $23 million related to other CapEx restructuring activities. CapEx during the same period last year was $112 million.","Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $225 million. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion. The impact on the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $35 million. We continue to anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. As Jerome and Ken highlighted, our growth in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by accelerated volume in both Food Care and Product Care. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of 90 million for the full year 2016.","Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at 218 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately 275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.60. We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately 550 million. CapEx is expected to be 275 million, which includes approximately 125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at 150 million.","For the full year we expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately 80 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at 90 million. And we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately 40 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be 210 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at 125 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you our fourth-quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, February 9. With that, operator can you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Hi everyone, thanks for the details and good luck with the transaction. I will try to ask a two part question, not to cheat too much. In food and beverage, is there a way to parse how the drag that you are seeing in emerging markets may lessen in the fourth quarter such that we might be able to peg what the broader food volume might look like in the quarter, and then the related question would be, in the past and understandably the portfolio decision previously wasn't your decision. The company has talked about the benefits of having the hygiene business in conjunction with food packaging. Explain to us why whatever synergy there might have been isn't as important on a going forward basis. Thank you, guys.","Karl Deily","Okay so this is Karl and I will start with your second question first that's okay. We have had synergies with the hygiene business. However, the natural fit is to keep the hygiene business with the Diversey Care business due to the synergies of supply chain and a number of other things. And obviously our ability to partner going forward will still be there. But they are two different businesses with two different sales processes and sales cycles and we feel it is the most prudent thing to do to include them in the spin. Now on your first question, I wish I could answer Latin America.","We thought that Brazil had bottomed out and Argentina was going along relatively well, and they both took a turn for the worse at the end of the quarter which had an impact. We still had very good positive growth going in the northern cone of Latin America so we obviously are keeping our pulse on the market and our key customers and having very good introduction of new products and value added products in Latin America. So as soon as the market does start to turn positive, we expect to get an accelerated growth. But we just have to stay close to that market because it is volatile.","Lori Chaitman ","George do you have a follow up or are you good?","George Staphos","I will turn it over and try to come back just to be fair. Thanks.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you George. Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. ","Scott Gaffner","Jerome, you made a comment in your opening remarks. You said the separation between Diversey and legacy Sealed Air would create a leaner and more entrepreneurial environment, you said for both businesses, but I'm just trying to square that with the move to Charlotte. You spent tens of millions, almost $100 million on a new headquarters to create a larger more centralized organization, so is there something that changed along the way where Diversey didn't fit within that more centralized model? Can you flush those the diverging comments out?","Jerome Peribere","So for those who know me well I hate centralization. What I want to do is to make sure that we have centers of excellence, and this is what we will be creating and that's where we are creating in our new campus. Having said that, it is not because I don't like the Diversey business. It is because we believe that by having those two entities separated we'll create a better shareholder value for both entities. You have to realize that the old Diversey was a faint shadow of what it is now. It really woke up a very traditional industry.","We are not seeing this yet in sales growth. We've seen sales growth, but it's nothing compared to what this New Diversey business is going to be over the years to come. Think about the Internet of Clean. 100% biodegradable products, trico sunsee products, robotics. By the way at the ISSA this week, we're announcing a new alliance on robotics with discovery robotics, and that's going to even increase the pace of our differentiation with our potential competitors.","Think about dry lubensee: this is a very strong self-standing entity. And when you think about what we have done in the past three years we have an improvement of profitability of what is now to be called the New Diversey on order of 15% EBITDA improvement on a compounded annual growth rate in the last three years. Very frankly, it's ready to fly from its own wings. It is going to enable an even more entrepreneurial approach. I really believe it is the right time.","Scott Gaffner","Just a quick follow up on the capital allocation there. You said you were going to have the same capital structure at each business. But you said Diversey has lower capital requirements and relatively high free cash flow. Is there a reason why you wouldn't maybe have a higher leverage ratio at Diversey spend versus the legacy business?","Jerome Peribere","We are working on all of this Scott, and you will see all of that in our Form 10. We have preliminary numbers at this point in time. You will be able to own two ATM machines now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson, Keybanc. Please go ahead.","Adam Josephson","Question on volume trends, you're up about 1% in the first quarter, up 0.5% in the second quarter, you were flattish this quarter, can you big picture talk about what has changed as the year has unfolded, and what you expect to happen next year with respect to volume. I know you talked at the Analyst Day Jerome about expecting a pretty significant acceleration volume growth in the years to come, do you still think that's a reasonable expectation just in light of what's unfolded this year and if so why?","Jerome Peribere","Let me be very transparent as I like to always be. I have been a bit disappointed with our 1% growth in Q3. But these are two different stories. At that time I did not anticipate the severity of the Australia reduction in the beef market. At that time being in July when I announced the second quarter results, we were coming from a strong Latin American Brazilian recovery on the beef markets, because it was volume growth was there, et cetera and it didn't continue.","It has been just a little positive blip, and as Karl by their way said on Food Care, northern LATAM is very strong and southern LATAM is bad. At that time I was fearing that we would be hurt as Ilham had clearly said we were going to be impacted by the instability of the Middle East and the hospitality business in markets like France, Belgium, and Germany, and we have been a little bit more.","Having said that, and to come to your question, I am very pleased with what we are seeing in some very key markets where we are executing on changed again strategies. North American. Food Care has had a 3.5% volume growth in the third quarter. North American Product Care has had, which is a very key market for us, very big for us in Product Care, has had a 7% volume growth when you exclude the 100 basis points from the divestitures from the portfolio rationalization, and Diversey Care had a very tough comparable in the first Porter and yet has been positive.","That tells me that we should be confident on Q4, and I am confident on Q4, and what is going to be really the barometer for me, is going to be how are we going to grow volume in Q4 and in each of those three divisions. And I can assure you that we are projecting volume growth in Q4 in each of those divisions, and slowly volume growth and that's definitely in our mind is showing the cutoff between the trends in 2015 and '16 into 2017.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you Adam, do you have a follow-up?","Adam Josephson","Carol, just a quick one just on cash flow. Just in light of some of the changes you made to your projections on cash restructuring, interest, et cetera. Carol can you just remind us what you talked about as far as 2017 as far as CapEx, cash restructuring, working cap, cash taxes, et cetera, just so we have some early bridge to 2017 on the cash flow-line Carol? Thanks very much.","Carol Lowe","Adam, what we have referenced for CapEx for 2017 was that we would be at approximately 200 million, and actually have said that would be the number going forward. Obviously with all of our numbers, we'll have to update post then as we look at our working capital for the consolidated Sealed Air it was estimated to be positive cash flow of approximately 50 million for 2017. We had not given specific guidance relative to tax payment for 2015. We are projecting 125 million for 2016.","They will be slightly higher than that as we move forward. If we look at restructuring payments we had originally said cash payments for restructuring would be approximately 100 million excluding CapEx restructuring. As we have reduced the amount that we anticipate to spend in 2016 to 90 million, that difference because we were previously at 110 million we would increase 2017 by 20 million. So in total for 2016 and 2017 we would stay at the 210 million, but we'll have a shift into 2017.","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Please Proceed.","Brian Maguire","Jerome I have a couple questions about Diversey all along those same lines. But first I was just wondering before and after the spin if you considered trying to find a strategic partner for it or if there was any thought about ever trying to sell the business? Kind of related to that, wondering if that were to be an option if you'd have any significant tax leakage? And then, just a third part of that, just wondering after you spin it if you'd expect any restrictions on anybody being able to buy New Diversey, and any tax implications that can come back to New Sealed Air? Thanks.","Jerome Peribere","Okay so again good question. The spin is a tax-free operation as you know and the potential there would be a taxable operation and my responsibility is to ensure maximum shareholder value. We are reviewing the tax basis as we are merging many legal entities, but the board has been authorized to evaluate a spin based on the information it has and therefore supported the spin. So that's what I can say. Once again as a standalone company it's going to thrive over time.","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please. Brian do you have a follow-up?","Brian Maguire","Just one if I can sneak one in. I think Jerome, at one point you talked about Diversey getting to a 15% margin. I recognize there will be some incremental corporate expense and hygiene part of Food Care would be in there a little bit. But just wondering if that's still an aspirational target for Diversey that is reasonable?","Jerome Peribere","It's not an aspiration. It is what I really believe it can deliver. So you heard two things. You heard me say for a long time and Dr. Kadri said also, we're on our way and we have been improving double digit the EBITDA of the Diversey Care business by about 12% per year in the last three years. On a constant currency basis. What you heard me also say a few minutes ago in my prepared remarks is that when you take the New Diversey, which includes the hygiene business over the last three years we had a 15% compounded annual growth rate in EBITDA and this is the result of innovation, of rationalization, a new way to go to market, et cetera.","The separation of Diversey has nothing to do with any disappointment of the situation. I'm actually bullish about the prospect of that. So the 15% target by 2018 is still here, strong and standing and when you compare 2016 with 2015 you will continue to see the progress and compare it again with 2014, we're seeing that on and on and very solid.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you Brian. Operator next question please?","Operator","We don't have any details unfortunately, so please state your name and company name. No response there. Your next call comes from the line of Jason Freuchtel, please go ahead and state your company name.","Jason Freuchtel","Hi, good morning this is Jason Freuchtel from SunTrust.","Lori Chaitman","Hi Jason","Jason Freuchtel","You guys repurchased an impressive 3.5 million shares in the quarter, and it looks like you still have a little bit of room to increase your leverage within your targeted range. Do you want to maintain some cushioning or leverage ratio given the current macro environment, or are there any other plain uses of cash in the near term that would prevent you from being equally or more aggressive in repurchasing shares in the near term?","Carol Lowe ","Thank you Jason. As we have stated before our leverage target is 3.5 to 4 times. We came out of Q3 at approximately 3.8 times or about flat with where we were at the end of June this year. We are very cognizant of some of the macroeconomic challenges that are out there on a global basis. And as we have always said, based on indications from the economy and how our various markets are performing, we would move between that 3.5 to 4.","Right now, we see some good points and some conservatism. We have been active in the market, and we have still a lot outstanding in the approved program from the Board of Directors. We actually have $884 million that still available under the board authorization. So management will take the action that is appropriate given the leverage and given the performance of the business, which we see is continuing to improve and get stronger as Jerome noted in his remarks headed into Q4 and into 2017.","Jerome Peribere","In fact we have $670 million left in the authorization. We have $670 million left, and what we will have to review is our leverage ratio band as we separate the two entities. What I can assure you, and actually this is led by Carol, is we're not going to increase the leverage because we don't feel it is appropriate. But we will review all of those and we will guide in the future about those.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde. Please state your company name.","Mark Wilde","Hi, it's Mark Wilde from BMO. Good morning Jerome, good morning Carol. A couple of questions, first is a possible Carol to quantify the cost to Diversey of being a separate public company?","Carol Lowe","We're still in the process of preparing the standalone financials and they will be available when we file the form 10. So we're not prepared to comment on those at this time.","Mark Wilde","No ballpark estimates or anything?","Jerome Peribere","No speculation.","Mark Wilde","And then I wondered if either Jerome or Carol could talk with us a little bit about how you see the impact of resin prices in the fourth quarter, just in terms of lags between when resin moves and when your product pricing might move?","Jerome Peribere","So the polyethylene situation is right now is a big question and you have CDI and HIS which are projecting a slight reduction over time. Some are saying that the $0.05 will be given back. You know that the October increase didn't go through et cetera. So as you say as you know we had to take a little bit of time so there's been an impact on our cost and all of this is included in our Q4 EBITDA projection.","Mark Wilde","Can you give us any sense of what the size of that might be?","Jerome Peribere","No that's too much detail here, but as we say as you know we are and agile organization. We make sure that our pricing discipline is staying intact and when you look at the gross profit of Sealed Air you have seen in the third quarter we have increased our gross profits by about 70 basis points, which just shows that we are very focused on those kind of things and it is as valid, same thing for the Food Care division.","Mark Wilde","Finally if I could Jerome, your margins are kind of back in both of the packaging businesses, where the company had margins in the late 90s and early 2000s. What's the additional run rate that you see in both businesses?","Jerome Peribere","As we introduce our knowledge base solutions, as I hope you were going to be coming to Pack Expo and your jaw is going to fall if you do. You will see the we do have margin expansion opportunities, both in product care and in Food Care. By the way PackEx, you will also see our innovation in Food Care, which is why I'm taking that opportunity to once again invite everybody to come and see the New Sealed Air and Sealed Air at Pack Expo, and to come and visit the potential for New Diversey at the ISSA this week, and also going to have some robotics at Pack Expo the week of November 7.","By working that booth, either this week at ISSA or at Pack Expo week of November 7, you will be able to realize that it's not necessary for me to highlight the changed again strategy because they are there and a visit is worth 1000 words.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you. Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Please go ahead.","Edlain Rodriguez","Thank you, good morning guys. One quick question and this is a follow-up to the resin costs going up. Jerome can you talk about the levers you have to offset those costs for the customers that don't have formula-based pricing? How quickly can you go to those other customers to raise prices to offset higher costs?","Jerome Peribere","Okay well first of all we have for a long time moved from a cost plus-based company to a value-creating company. We're seeing this all the time. When you look at this, if I just tell you that for meat processor packaging is less than 1% of the cost, it's nothing compared to the value that we create to them. And we create value to the meat processes, we create value to the retailers by reducing food waste, meat waste, et cetera, et cetera.","So we're just not pricing based on our cost. So this concept that the price goes up when resin prices go up and the price go down when resin prices go down is not the right concept. With some customers we do have a formula. And we apply those formulas. But I think it's very important to see that like every company we do have a commodity business and we make sure we are competitive in the commodity business. And as a solutions business we just don't price according to our costs.","Lori Chaitman","Do you have a follow-up question?","Edlain Rodriguez","Yes I do. One quick one on the spinoff decision. When you look at another two companies, now they are going to be separate, was there any reason why you wanted to do the separation. For example, can you give any examples of any constraints that you had between New Diversey and New Sealed Air by being together in terms of transactions you wanted to do, but couldn't do because it didn't make sense for one part of the portfolio, or investments you have to forego by being together?","Jerome Peribere","Carol has talked to you about the synergies between food packaging and food hygiene and they are very small. So that's point number one. Then you go and look at whether the R&D is similar. It is not, in one case you are dealing with chemicals and you are dealing basically with chemicals on the other side you are dealing with specialty highly specialized plastic extrusion et cetera. Then you look at the customer base and the overlap is not very strong. Then actually it is weak. When you look at supply chain and you see the same. So when you really think about it, the synergies are low. So from then on you've got to go and wonder whether you're going there, are things, what is the best solution? The best solution for us was to really look at how we can improve this business and as I said, the old Diversey is a feint shadow of what it is now.","We now have a winning company in the marketplace. We have value added solution for our customers and when we switch a customer to us it is because they see the differential advantage of our solution and this is why. So it's not so much a question of if it would be a question of when and the reason why we started to do it now is because no kidding, under the leadership of Dr. Kadri, this New Diversey is going to fly very nicely under by its own wing.","If there was one thing which has been positive, is the creation of one culture and this is why we have leveraged all of those kind of things. And the decision on the campus by the way has been taken in the summer of 2014. At time at which we do not think we would do what we do now, but we're actually doing it now because we do believe that the recovery of the New Diversey has been faster than what we think it could be.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","First up, how should we think about the termination of the SC Johnson relationship? Looks like they're returning to the traditional cleaning business as announced a couple days ago. In your 10 K you highlighted that the loss of the license could have material impact on Diversey, and especially since they're now competitors as well, so how should we think about what offsets you have towards that?","Jerome Peribere","So in fact, you got to go back to the Genesis of this agreement. This agreement had been signed between SC Johnson and the Diversey division when Diversey was part of SC Johnson. Between you and me it was not a good long term fit for Diversey. Diversey under Sealed Air offers New Diversey as it is going to be. What you have to look therefore is about the long term and very frankly there are some very strong long-term opportunities.","So in the short term, it might be a short term downside but that is not the most important thing. We have new agreements in place with spectrum brands. We are working nicely with Nacoma. We are going to have more of those, we're going to be launching our cryovacs better bags. And this is by the way we have verified that this cryovac brand, which will stay with Diversey is a very strong brand and we're going to be continuing to announce more partnerships. This agreement signed under -- long ago when SCJ was owning Diversey was limiting the potential for Diversey.","Ghansham Panjabi","Okay can ask another question?","Lori Chaitman","Go ahead Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi","For New Sealed Air, which would be fluid and Product Care, Jerome what you envision the strategy will be longer-term apart from the growth initiatives you have in place. Does it make sense to think about another vertical in the portfolio to complement the remaining segments? You called out farm to fork in your slide deck and hopefully you're not going to acquire farms. But what is your strategic view on the residual portfolio.","Jerome Peribere","My view is that focus is a very strong strength of the company and this is going to enable us to do exactly that. So we do have two divisions which are formidable competitors in their space. And what I can assure you is that we're going to be working on reinforcing those two divisions to make them even stronger. We might add another strategic pillar which will have either commonality on technology to leverage our technology, very unique technology, or our common entity on our customer base. We're here to add value to our customers. And I really believe that we're going to be able to do that better. So what you should expect over time is us to reward our shareholders to accelerate our innovation and to increase and to do M&A.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Jerome, at your analyst day you laid out detailed targets for the segments and then a free cash flow goal for the combined company for 2018, and my question is when you look at the 2018 free cash flow goal, do you still feel you can achieve that? Do you have some levers that you can offset the slower organic growth you've seen this year? And in the Form 10, can we expect you will breakout or update the 2018 free cash flow goal between New Sealed Air and New Diversey?","Jerome Peribere","I don't think the Form 10 will highlight the New Sealed Air free cash flow goal, but your point is very valid. When we were talking about the free cash flow goals of 2018 was a result of some organic growth that we're seeing, let me remind you that because we have that in mind and I'm reminded that to all my division presidents every single day as they start the day. We said 4% to 5% in Food Care, 4% to 5% in Product Care, and 3% to 4% in Diversey Care, and this was for the period of 2016 through 2018. As I told you, I also told you that the first half of 2016 was going to be mused and we were going to see the growth coming up in the second half.","I'm not pleased, I told you earlier that I was a little bit disappointed with the first quarter, but I am optimistic about the fourth quarter as I indicated 3% growth and about 2017. So we will update you all of this. The 775 at the time was taking the given assumption on currency and on the world stage, which is not exactly that one. Having said that, we will update you when good time with our 2018 goals, and you always should look for opportunities to expand the margins and maximizing this free cash flow. And as you have seen in an environment which is not been really good this year because of lack of growth, we have been confirming our guidance of free cash flow for 2016. So we are very, very focused on those things.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you Jerome, and Anthony do you have a follow-up?","Anthony Pettinari","Just maybe one follow-up with the lower organic growth that you have seen year-to-date, do you think you're tracking end market demand in Food Care and Product Care, or do you feel that you've lost any share or are you seeing any real changes in the competitive dynamics in Food Care and Product Care?","Jerome Peribere","Let me be very, very clear. We are increasing our share. There's not a shadow of a doubt.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you Anthony","Jerome Peribere","And by the way we are increasing the share thanks to our very powerful innovation. See you the week of November 7 in Pack Expo I hope.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you Jerome and thank you Anthony and thanks everybody for all your questions. Operator that concludes our call.","Operator","Thank you very much indeed. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect. Thank you very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As I reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Shannon. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I'd like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future periods are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release and slide presentation which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in our earnings release. Included in the appendix of today's presentation, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that correspond to some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures we reference throughout the presentation.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Ted Doheny, our President and CEO. Ted?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Lori. I want to thank all of you for your interest in Sealed Air and welcome to our 2018 first quarter conference call. Before Bill and I discuss our first quarter results, business trends and 2018 outlook, I'd like to note a change to our reporting structure. Starting this quarter, we allocated more expenses from a corporate segment to our divisions. This change was implemented to accelerate productivity improvements, drive accountability and eliminate operational redundancies. For your convenience in modeling purposes, we provided 2017 results to reflect the revised allocation of these expenses. Please note that our decision to move expenses from the corporate segment to the divisions has no impact on our total adjusted EBITDA.","Now, let's move to our first quarter results. We had a solid start to the year. Operating leverage improved, we've reduced our fixed cost structure, and we invested in new innovations to drive profitable growth. Our first quarter net sales of $1.1 billion increased 10% over last year and adjusted EBITDA of $205 million was up 13% over the same period. Operating leverage, or what we define as our profit-to-growth ratio, was 23%, tracking above our full-year target of 20%. As a reminder, this ratio represents the year-over-year change in EBITDA over the change in sales. Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.51, a 19% increase over Q1 2017.","Our performance in the first three months of the year combined with favorable global business trends gives us confidence in our 2018 outlook. We are on track to achieve our full year 2018 guidance for net sales, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. To account for the 9 million shares we repurchased in January, we raised our earnings per share forecast to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.55. We announced today that the board approved a new share repurchase program of $1 billion, replacing the prior authorizations. This represents an increase of approximately $500 million from what was remaining under our previous program. Keep in mind, our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases.","To deliver our objectives for 2018, we're focused on opportunities that will create the most value. First, accelerate profitable sales of our innovative solutions in high-growth markets and geographies. We want to be top of mind when our customers are trying to solve their most critical packaging and fulfillment challenges. Second, take our operational excellence on how we innovate, buy, make and sell materials, systems and solutions to world class. We have good systems in place, but there's room for improvement, and these improvements will expand margins and increase our return on invested capital.","And third, reduce our cost structure and drive organizational productivity by operating as one Sealed Air. Our focus is to address stranded costs from the Diversey sale, but we are going beyond stranded costs with additional actions, some of which were taken in the first quarter. We delivered $10 million in incremental restructuring savings in Q1, primarily attributable to stranded cost reduction activities. For the full year, we expect restructuring savings to be approximately $30 million. Bill and I will discuss these actions and opportunities in more detail throughout the remainder of our prepared remarks.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Bill.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Ted. Turning to slide 4, let's start with the review of our net sales by region. In the first quarter, we delivered $1.1 billion on net sales with all regions delivering constant dollar sales growth. Excluding the acquisition of Fagerdala, Latin America was our fastest-growing region at 8%. Strength in Latin America was primarily driven by Brazil, where we benefited from a stronger cattle market in addition to new customer wins. North America was up 5%, with 8% growth in Product Care and 4% in Food Care. Growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, of 4% was led by positive sales trends in the UK, Germany, Spain and Russia. Asia Pacific increased 11%, including sales from Fagerdala. Excluding Fagerdala, Asia Pacific was down slightly, primarily due to continued market weakness in Australia and New Zealand in Food Care.","Turning to slide 5, let me walk you through our first quarter net sales and adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year basis. Volume increased 2%, contributing $24 million to top line results. Price\/mix was $18 million favorable or 2%. We delivered positive volume and price\/mix trends in both Food Care and Product Care. Currency translation was favorable by $36 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $205 million or 18% of net sales. Growth in adjusted EBITDA was attributable to higher volumes, restructuring savings, and operating discipline and favorable currency. This was partially offset by unfavorable mix and price\/cost spread.","Volume growth contributed $9 million. Restructuring savings were $10 million. Cost management and income from acquisitions contributed $2 million. Currency was favorable by $6 million. Unfavorable mix and price\/cost spread of $4 million was due to higher input and freight costs as well as the timing of Food Care's contract pass-throughs. In addition, Product Care was also impacted by the timing of price realization.","As Ted noted earlier, we made a change to our reporting structure beginning this quarter. While this change does not impact our total EBITDA, I do want to provide some color on what this is expected to look like going forward. Our 2018 guidance for the corporate segment prior to this change was less than $100 million. We expect approximately $60 million of these expenses to be allocated to Food Care and $30 million of these expenses to be allocated to Product Care with the remaining reported as the new corporate.","Adjusted EPS was $0.51 on average diluted shares outstanding of 165 million. Our adjusted tax rate was 30% in the first quarter 2018. We continue to estimate our tax rate for the full-year 2018 to be approximately 29%. As we indicated on our last quarterly earnings call, we are currently evaluating opportunities to optimize our tax posture. Included in our GAAP earnings, we recorded at $290 million provisional tax expense related to the one-time mandatory tax on un-repatriated foreign earnings as a part of the U.S. tax reform.","Let's now turn to our free cash flow for the three months of the year on slide 6. Free cash flow for the three months ended March 31 was a use of cash of $63 million, which included the one-time payment in lieu of certain future royalty payments for patents to an outside engineering firm. As you may recall, in December 2017, we entered into an agreement to pay $50 million of which $5 million was paid in 2017, and the remainder was paid in January 2018. CapEx was $43 million. Interest payments, net of interest income were $38 million and cash tax payments were $19 million. For the year, we continue to expect CapEx to be $160 million, interest payments net of interest income to be $175 million, and cash tax payments to be $145 million.","Let me now pass the call back to Ted for more details on our divisions and our outlook. Ted?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Bill. Turning to slide 7, which highlights volume and price\/mix trends by division and by region, on a global basis, volume trends were up 2% in Food Care, with positive trends in all regions except Asia-Pacific due to declines in Australia and New Zealand. We expect the protein and dairy market conditions in Australia and New Zealand to improve this year.","Product Care, excluding the impact of Fagerdala, delivered 3% volume growth with 3% growth in North America, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Price\/mix was favorable in Food Care and Product Care, due to our announced price increases and continued shift to value-added solutions, both of which partially offset higher input and freight costs. As we continue to work through our product portfolio and deliver new innovations, we're finding more ways to help our customers save money and solve their most critical packaging challenges. I want to highlight that we experienced some more favorable mix in our e-commerce and fulfillment business in the first quarter. This was a key contributor to the higher margins in Product Care.","Let's turn to slide 8 and review Food Care results. In the first quarter, Food Care delivered $696 million in net sales or 3% constant dollar sales growth due to positive volume and price\/mix trends. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% in constant dollars to $135 million or 19.3% of sales. EBITDA results include $10 million of expenses previously allocated to corporate. You can see in the sales and EBITDA bridge that despite favorable price\/mix on the top line, our profitability was negatively impacted by an unfavorable mix in price\/cost spread. This was due to timing of contract pass-throughs and higher input and freight costs. We expect this trend to improve for the remainder of the year.","Food Care has also benefited from our efforts to reduce costs. You can see these efforts in restructuring savings and operating costs in the bridge, which, combined, contributed a positive $9 million to adjusted EBITDA.","I want to highlight the trends that we experienced in Q1 that we expect to continue throughout the year. Our case-ready platform continues to grow globally at above market rates. In North America, case-ready was up double digits. We are seeing strong customer acceptance and increased adoption with the seafood and convenience segments.","Second, the momentum continued in high-growth geographies, such as Brazil, Russia, China and Southeast Asia in the first quarter. We expect this trend to continue going forward as demand increases for packaged proteins and convenience meals. And third, in North America and EMEA, the ongoing shift to fresh foods, combined with our sustainable, innovative packaging, is driving our above-market growth across all proteins. We're also excited to see our penetration into the rigid container market, with our flexible packaging systems for fluids such as condiments, sauces, and soups.","In Q1, North American beef production was muted due to weather and other factors. However, the industry forecast for the full year 2018 is still expected to be in the 3% to 4%, as demand for domestic and exports accelerate in Q2. Looking ahead, we're on track to achieve our 3% constant dollar sales growth for the full year 2018. We expect adjusted EBITDA to improve in the second half versus the first half, primarily due to seasonality and the timing of contract pass-throughs.","Moving to slide 9 where we highlight results from our Product Care division, in the first quarter, Product Care delivered $435 million in net sales or 11% constant dollar growth. Excluding Fagerdala, Product Care delivered 6% growth on higher volumes and favorable price\/mix. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% in constant dollars to $780 million or 18% of net sales. EBITDA results include $6 million of expenses previously allocated to corporate. You can see in Products Care (sic) [Product Care] EBITDA bridge that the year-over-year increase was driven by profitable volume, restructuring savings and cost management. We're seeing a more profitable mix of business, particularly in e-commerce and fulfillment segment, as our pricing actions are taking hold.","Our mix in price\/cost spread was negative due to the timing of price realization and other higher input and freight costs. We expect our mix in price\/cost spread to improve for the remainder of the year. Our e-commerce and fulfillment business represents 30% to 35% of Product Care sales and is growing 15%. Our innovative portfolio, which includes the next generation inflatable Bubble Wrap, automated systems such as I-Pack and StealthWrap, and our unique Korrvu packaging is delivering 15%-plus growth as well. We also had high single-digit growth in Instapak due to an improved industrial environment. Overall, our business has continued to gain momentum, and our top priority going forward is to drive higher profitable sales from our innovations.","The integration of Fagerdala is progressing well and has provided us with a platform for greater sales and cost synergies. For example, our specialty foam solutions increased 9% organically in the quarter, demonstrating the power of our enhanced offering and combined sales efforts. We're also leveraging their technical expertise to expand our portfolio of custom solutions targeting existing and adjacent markets. For the full year of 2018, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 7%. Fagerdala is on track to achieve nearly $100 million in sales of which $70 million is incremental since we closed the acquisition in early October 2017. Under the new reporting structure, Product Care adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to expand over last year.","Now, turning to our total company 2018 outlook on slide 10, net sales are expected to be in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.8 billion with constant dollar growth of approximately 4.5%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $890 million to $910 million, improving in EBITDA margin of 19%. As I noted earlier, we're increasing a range for adjusted earnings per share to $2.45 to $2.55, reflecting our year-to-date share repurchases. We forecast free cash flow from continuing operations to be approximately $400 million.","To wrap up the call, I'd like to provide a brief discussion on our strategic directions, which you can see at a high level on slide 11. In my first 100 days-plus as CEO, I traveled around the world getting to know our people, operations, suppliers, and customers. I've been working closely with our senior leadership team to refine and pivot our long-term profitable growth strategy, while aggressively going after near-term opportunities to take Sealed Air's performance to the next level. We're focusing on growth opportunities from new innovations, driving operational excellence, recognizing and promoting talent, and targeting strategic investments that will create value.","We're building a solution model that starts with focusing on how we can solve our customers' most critical challenges and save them the most money. This is leading us to high-growth geographies, market adjacencies, and next-generation technologies, including digitalization and automation. We're using our market-leading brands in existing core competencies to penetrate these markets. We're accelerating our investments in proprietary and sustainable materials, including renewable and recycled content.","We recently introduced new metrics to manage our portfolio. Our profit-to-growth ratio is designed to improve our operating leverage. It has helped us to manage our portfolio, drive operational excellence, move the needle on innovation, and improve earnings quality. We're using ROIC as a guide to our investments in capital allocation strategy. We'll continue to focus on opportunities that are accretive to earnings and create long-term value for our shareholders. Our people around the world are making all of this happen. I'm excited to see our organization's high level of energy, integrity, and passion for our business and customers.","Before we open up the call for your questions, we ask that you please mark your calendars for Thursday, August 2, for our second quarter 2018 earnings call. Shannon, we'd like to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. You may begin.","Molly Baum - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is actually Molly Baum sitting in for George. He's on another call right now. But my first question I wanted to ask, if you could provide a bit more color on Asia Pacific volumes, specifically in Australia and New Zealand? I know you had mentioned in the prepared remarks that you expect the volumes to improve this year, but if you could maybe provide more color on timing of the shift and kind of what you're expecting for the full year? Thank you.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. Looking at Asia-Pacific, just as quickly though around the world, Asia-Pacific is third in our volume as we look specifically, you're talking about the Food Care business. We're still seeing Australia in the quarter down. We're still seeing New Zealand down, primarily driven by what's going on in the meat cycle and dairy. We do hope to see it return by the second half. But right now, we still see it down in the area. We have seen China up, actually double digit, but it's a very, very small piece of our business.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Lars Kjellberg with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Lars F. Kjellberg - Credit Suisse Securities Europe Ltd. (Sweden)","Yeah. Thank you. Just on the mix price\/cost improvement that you expect to have in the second half, can you provide us any visibility or your view on the visibility you have on that and what are the principal drivers do you expect to see in that guidance, and some sort of stabilization or downturn in resin cost would be one question of course. But any color you can give, that will be helpful.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. This is Ted, and I'll let Bill jump in as well. But focusing on the price\/cost mix and we just talked about cost and obviously resin with being a leading piece of our cost, we were anticipating going in this year that we may see the resins move down in the quarter. We didn't see that, which we talked on the last call, we were late behind some of that pricing efforts there and our contracts on the Food Care could still take some time to catch up. Looking out to the second half of the year, we still see that choppy. We're seeing some of the forecasts that say that we should see resin drop. But in even talking to some of our leading suppliers, we're anticipating they might be still trying to get a price increase out there. So overall, we see the puts and takes, we see it choppy, flat, but we don't see a drop till the second half and maybe even late in the second half of the year.","Other input costs in there that really are hitting us in the quarter and hitting everyone is freight. So part of our price increases that we put out there and the most recent one on the Product Care, we didn't get that to take effect until April. So, we think we'll be ahead of that on the second half of the year, that's what we're planning for. But the choppiness in our cost structure, our input price is still out there, we think we'll be ahead of it though in the second half of the year.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","So, you have noted that the first quarter of 2018, we were negative on mix and price\/cost spread. We expect that to continue to improve as we move through 2018. We actually expect near the end of the second quarter of 2018 that that will actually turn positive, and continue to improve and be positive throughout the balance of 2018 for both Food Care and Product Care.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. You may begin.","Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. Given the increasingly difficult comparisons for Food Care during the second half of the year, can you provide some added detail on the expected volume cadence for food packaging throughout 2018?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","The first quarter, as we talked a little bit about what's going on, we're behind catching up on the contract price \u2013 our contract pricing coming through. We think we'll be catching up that on the second half. The North America, looking at the first half, North America being very strong last year. We still are seeing, I'll say, muted or tepid growth in the first quarter on meat. We think we have opportunities though in Asia in the meat cycle in the back end of the year.","Trying to think what else on there. On Europe, actually interesting because I was in Europe twice in the past quarter. We see some opportunities on the catch-up on the price, and we also see some pickup on some of our new products, in especially Darfresh. Darfresh on Tray was quite interesting, actually seeing a supermarket in Italy, in France, and then Holland. Definitely the pickup on some of our new products and innovations in Europe I think we should see an opportunity for some volume growth in the second half in Europe and plus getting ahead or getting caught up on the pricing side. So see opportunities in the second half.","The final piece, going around the world, looking at Latin America, Latin America having fairly strong growth in the first quarter. We see that could continue, especially the comparables in Latin America should be helping us on the second half of the year.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. You may begin.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. This is (27:08) for Edlain. Looking at your EPS guidance, do you have any additional share repurchase baked into that for 2018? And going forward, what are your priorities for cash?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","So, as we've said, we don't model future share repurchases into our guidance. What we've said is we are going to be active in the market relative to share repurchases, but the guidance is basically calculating 162 million shares and would not contemplate any additional shares.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Ted, use of cash?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. We're not giving any guidance on the share repurchase. We are looking though on investments. As we've talked before on the strategic investments, both internally \u2013 we'll first talk about internally. Some of the investments in our facilities, investments in capacity, we're looking to. We have some opportunity there to debottleneck some of our facilities. We're also looking at some of our investments in the sustainability area. We're looking at some of \u2013 we have some interesting opportunities with some renewable-type resins we're looking for investments this year in.","And then on strategic investments, the M&A, we're still always comparing that with the share buyback. We now have some pretty good data on how we've been in the market. You saw how aggressive we were in the first quarter. We're comparing that investment to our acquisitions. We now have the data of what Fagerdala looks like. We put $100 million into Fagerdala. We're looking at the accretive power of that acquisition to buying the same $100 million worth of shares. And right now, Fagerdala is ahead of that on accretion, and we're being very disciplined. We're looking at the ROIC on potential acquisitions that are out there, and we're being very frugal and making sure that they meet our financial targets, so.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. You may begin.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. And good morning, everyone. My question has to do with the future view toward your balance sheet. I know the previous CEO and under his regime, a leverage ratio of 3.5 to 4 times was what was viewed as sort of where Sealed Air would like to target. And I just wanted to know, as you look at all the opportunities, where you see that leverage? And as part of the question, if you could also let us know a little bit about what your thoughts are about future restructuring savings. You mentioned $30 million this year. Are we likely to see something similar in 2019 and 2020?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure. So on the leverage ratio, you'll know that at the end of Q3 after we sold Diversey, the transaction closed in September of 2017, we ended Q3 with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.4 times. It went up a little bit at the end of the year to 3.2, and now we're at 3.6 times, and that's primarily because of our share repurchases. That's what's actually driving that.","And relative to the restructuring savings, we continue to drive those costs out of the business. We're very comfortable with a 3.5 to 4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. We're confident that we've started the process of operational productivity and driving a lower level of stranded costs and realizing those savings.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. I'll comment compared to my predecessor on the capital allocation strategy and the comfort level with that net debt to EBITDA ratio. As we stated early, the business has been comfortable at 3.5 to 4, and testing that and looking at we have pretty strong and stable markets that allow for us to do that. We generate strong cash. I believe we have even more opportunities to improve not only just our cash flow, but our cash conversion, so feel comfortable with that with what's out there.","Also, putting the targets into the organization, I think have really helped. We've seen that very quickly on the leverage ratio, managing what's coming into the business with our portfolio. I think we can pivot on that quickly as a guide. And that also leads in for us to look \u2013 as we do look at potential M&A, that it's got to be accretive to those metrics as well as accretive to the ROIC metric. That's really a great test. We already analyze what our competitors have bought. We looked at were they accretive to their cost of capital.","And so we're being very careful with that. And we want to be very opportunistic, and using the share buyback as our guide. If we can invest in the business and buy our own shares back and be opportunistic and generate and create value, that's what we'd like to do. With that guide of the 3.5 to 4, I think we have some pretty exciting opportunities with our capital allocation, looking internally, looking externally, and letting the numbers and letting these guides guide us to do the right thing.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Tom Narayan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks. This is actually Tom for Arun. I had a question on Product Care. You guys mentioned in the prepared remarks that 35% of the segment is e-Commerce and that was growing at 15%. I guess the question is where could this go, the 35%? Could that be the lion's share of the business? What's the competitive landscape there? It just seems like this could be a tremendous opportunity for you guys.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. This is Ted. Everybody's got a backup. There must be another call going on right now. Yeah, the e-Commerce is a tremendous opportunity for us, but as I'm using the language on the strategy of pivoting and refining our strategy, e-Commerce is a key one to look at because when you look at e-Commerce, who's not into e-Commerce right now. If we're not ready for what's going on in e-Commerce, we're not going to get this lift that's really out there for us in packaging.","So if you look at the difference in the quarter, you saw a pretty sharp pivot, and that is managing what goes through that portfolio. And we have the right \u2013 we have the ability to do that by \u2013 we can look at the margin, the products that are going in, where we could add value, but also it's really focusing on us to be in front of the customer and solving those problems.","This past week I was with one of the world's largest freight packaging companies, and I was at their logistics headquarters. We are now fully embedded with them with our own innovation center into their facility. I was able to see \u2013 it's unbelievable, 416,000 packages an hour going through that facility. So that's touching all of our customers that are going through there, even the Food Care business. So we have to be prepared that our portfolio fits into this very high growth market that we make money on it.","So, again, that's why those guides are there to do that. But it's forcing, asking \u2013 I was there with my counterpart and got to ask very directly, what are your biggest problems that you're solving, and it was quite interesting, similar, freight. How do they manage the freight going back? What can we do on our packaging to make it lighter? And then his next one was damage. Great, what can we do to get in there and with not only you as the freight supply logistics expert, but the packages that are coming through. We can solve those problems. We have some really interesting innovations to do that.","The other interesting piece in the data point in listening is in the e-Commerce market was returns. What can we do to help returns? Just a huge percentage that people \u2013 the home is becoming the new store. People are sending stuff to their home so that consumer experience. We have some pretty exciting innovations. We're working on some augmented reality that actually can tell you what's inside the package, tell you what you bought, and how interesting it is. And so we could help that e-Commerce market with some pretty exciting solutions and behind that, though, use our financial metrics to guide us into profitable growth in this market.","Just as you said, it's not going away and it will be a bigger part of our business, and we need to make it a bigger profitable part of our business. So we're exciting what e-Commerce can do. And not just Product Care, Food Care. Food Care is also extending the shelf life, but we're working with the same customers, how do we extend it from shelf life to truck life, the plane life, and we even had some interesting talks about drone life. So we think the opportunity there is for us, but we're going to have to manage that. It won't be our existing portfolio. We've got to look at our portfolio that matches this new high-growth market. So it's an exciting opportunity for us.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. You may begin.","John Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. This is John Dunigan on for Scott. Unfortunately, Scott's on that other call. I just wanted to go back to price\/mix for a second. Ted, I may have heard you wrong, but if you had said that the latest price increase in Product Care was in April, I think you might have said late April","(37:51).","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","No. Yeah, it was April 1. I apologize...","John Dunigan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. No problem. But just I guess overall, how are the conversations going with clients? Are you seeing them push back more because some of the resin prices are declining at this point? And then maybe you can give us some color on how you're thinking. If they do decline or continue declining throughout the rest of the year, how much Sealed Air can actually hold on to by the end of the year to be able to hit some of the targets that you've talked about?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. Well, you've got a bunch of questions in there. I'll go through the first one and if I miss a couple of the other questions, you'll have to remind me. The first one was how are our customers reacting to price increases. Well, you could probably answer that yourself. Not well. But it's an excuse for us to be at the table at all levels and figure out how do we handle this. And it's forcing us into the solutions conversation, can we save you money in other places, but it's a question that the price increase will come.","It's interesting on the price\/cost spread, though, on the timing of the price increase, just to give a little bit of color that was April 1. So we had pretty strong growth in Product Care in the first quarter. So one of the buying behaviors you get because we announced early, so we're anticipating some of our bump in Product Care in the first quarter was to pull product forward before the price increase. So that's I think a little bit of color to the first question.","The second part, where do we think it's going forward? Well, our team internally, there is no question on that decision. We have to find a way to manage our portfolio and get price in the marketplace. But really, as we're shifting that is how do we get value. So the same conversation is we have to look at our portfolio.","One of the most \u2013 this is another interesting anecdote, but meeting with customers in the e-Commerce market, we have shifted our mailers. We do a ton of mailers in e-Commerce. I think it's roughly around 1.2 billion mailers. So, we're looking now to do more than mailers and we have some pretty exciting new products. Well, before we even introduce the products, if we're dealing with the purchasing team, we had an interesting story that we introduced a brand-new product that I talked to you before about, TVs. Well, the first comment back from the customers purchasing that our price was too high, and they hadn't even seen the product. No one else has it.","So, again, to the story, pricing is very difficult. The only way we can get pricing through the market is if we find ways to help save them money. The TV saving opportunities that over 52% of those flat screens now are going through the Internet, their number one issue is damage. We have a unique solution that dramatically reduces damage, is sustainable, doesn't have Styrofoam in it, significantly lower weight, doesn't have to be repackaged, and that's what we got to focus on. What comes through is a better price\/cost mix in the portfolio.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. Great. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Brian Maguire on for Brian Maguire. Ted, a question on your comments about Diversey stranded cost, maybe going beyond just the Diversey stranded costs with your restructuring. There's a couple of elements to the question, but Sealed Air has been restructuring for a number of years. One of the critiques we often get is that there's always restructuring going on, there's always some cash being consumed by the restructuring activities. So I guess some elements of my question, should we expect that cash need for restructuring to continue into 2019 and to be at a similar level to where you're at 2018 or maybe even higher? And maybe you can go into detail a little bit on where you're finding opportunities for restructuring after a number of years of it happening.","And then sort of related to that. Just trying to understand the decision to fold the corporate expense into the segments, just wondering if that's related to it, and if your goal there is to try and drive greater accountability to the segment leaders for those expense buckets. But, yeah, if you could just kind of comment in general around your restructuring comments?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. No. Great questions, lots in there, but let's try. We'll give you a three part answer. I'll open it up on the why, I'll turn it over to Bill so he can give you some historical precedence because I can't answer the history, Bill can, and then I want to close to where you left it, how we're doing at the strategy of what we're trying to accomplish here.","So, the first piece on the restructuring in moving it, acting as one company, we did this to drive the productivity. Diversey was real. There was commitment out there. That's what I inherited. We're going to make the commitment. There was a dilution effect going and selling of Diversey. We had to cover $0.70. And to do that, we're going to buy back the shares or find an accretive acquisition. So, our job is to create value for shareholders.","But then, the other piece was take out the corporate cost when you're three divisions in one corporate and now you don't have that division. So, we said, let's take a look at the strategy of acting as one company and let's not take out the stranded cost because you have to. How do we be more efficient acting as one company? And looking at some of the costs that were in there, the corporate is not going to drive the engine. The divisions are driving the engine. Corporate is there for guidance and, obviously, they don't want to pay corporate expenses. So, corporate is going to have to justify the value. So, it's a strategic piece in there.","But I got to give Bill credit before I turn it over to Bill. Bill led this effort with the team and did a really nice job of getting this done with the team, and I'll let him explain the details on where the actual money is going and how we're doing that.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","So, first of all, on the cash restructuring spend itself, our free cash flow guidance of the $400 million includes cash restructuring payments for all of 2018 of $20 million, and that's deducted to arrive at the free cash flow. Not included in that calculation is an additional $30 million of that are going to be spent to address the stranded costs.","So basically $50 million this year and basically to answer your question, maybe another $20 million to $25 million in 2019 to address those restructuring and stranded cost needs. But relative to the stranded cost themselves, as we said, we have $10 million of restructuring savings in first quarter 2018. We're anticipating $30 million for the full year.","Ted and the leadership team are coming together and we all own the issue of organizational productivity and the resulting reduction of stranded costs. We understand that driving those costs out earlier than what was originally planned and earlier than what we had said in the third quarter of 2017's earnings release is very, very positive and will have a positive impact on our profit growth ratio.","And we also, to your question about disbanding the larger corporate segment and rolling those costs into our Food Care division and our Product Care division, what we said was $60 million of cost in full year 2018 would go to Food Care, $30 million to Product Care. That is having a total leadership team ownership of the stranded cost reductions and it contributes to a one Sealed Air focus that Ted continues to drive.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Right. And let's talk about the strategy, your comment. Are we going to be a serial restructuring company? No. What we're going to do is we're going to be driving organizational productivity. So we're actually giving definition on that. We're going to do more for less by investing in working smarter. And so we're going to put that speed into the organization to drive those returns.","Second is we are focused on the long term, and that's what at corporate and that's where we made the change in moving innovation. We are here for the long run. So, we are going to invest in things that don't have a three-year return. We are going to invest things that could fundamentally change the structure of the company. So, that's a corporate expense, corporate function, the divisions need to pay for that. We have some pretty exciting things.","And if you come to our innovation center here, in my six months, we have some exciting technology that we're working on that can change the game. We're not a private equity firm. A private equity firm has got a three-year window. We're different. We can invest in that, and we want to be productive because we want to beat the private equity in the short term, and we want to beat them in the long term. We think if we do those two things, we can beat the private equity because we're competing with them. And long term, we can add significant value for our shareholders, but we've got to incubate that. So, that's part of the strategy that's behind this change.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to see if we could get an update on your CFO search, and maybe just a couple of comments on how you're thinking about that right now?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","That's a great question because he's listening. Actually, what we shared and what I've been sharing with people when asked, I gave myself that like to look at this for six months. We have a good guy, our lead candidate, I get to work with all the time, which is Bill. We have a outside search going on and looking at candidates in the marketplace. Since I've had two other companies and dealt with a lot of the banks, we've got a lot of candidates that we're looking at, both formally and informally. But it's probably toughest on Bill listening right now to ask the question. I owe it to the business, I owe it to our people, that make sure that we look for the best candidates out there. With Bill listening right now, and as I already gave a shout out on what he's doing to actually lead some of these changes, he's been a pleasure to work with in sending that message.","So I don't want him to listen to his early assessment, but so far, I think this is an exciting company to be a part of. We're pivoting this strategy. This is a pretty cool place to work, so we have a lot of interest. So now that I'm saying this publicly, I'll probably get more, but that's where we are; gave myself six months to go get it done.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. You may begin.","Molly Baum - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my follow up. Just two quick things, the first was a follow-up to my question about the cattle cycle. So in terms of looking at Latin America and Brazil, when do you expect the cattle cycle to turn over? And then my second unrelated question, could you provide a bit more color on what the $12.7 million legal settlement gain was in the non-operating items? Thank you.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. I'll take the cattle and I'll turn the second question over to Bill. If we look at cattle in the U.S., as I shared, the U.S. has been somewhat muted. We think we have some opportunity. We had some weather-related issues, but the herd, I'm learning this, is there and ready, so it could be an opportunity in the second half. The one that's turned for us for two reasons: one, it's been down in Latin America, and we've had some share gain there, so we feel good that we could have some continued upside opportunity in Latin America. The other one, though, in Asia Pacific which is Australia and New Zealand is still on the down cycle, but we're anticipating a second half, but that could be as late as the end of the year. So, we do see that turning.","Bill, you want to answer the second?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Relative to the class action settlement, it relates to urethane purchases. This particular settlement arises from a 2004 class action lawsuit that relates to urethane purchases in 2000 through 2003, so quite some time ago. The defendant in this case lost the jury trial and agreed to settle. So, we have a share of the settlement income of $15 million, and we did record the $12.8 million in this quarter as a special item income and we'll record the rest when the rest of the cash is received.","Lori C.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this call is being recorded for recording purposes. And now I would like to hand the call over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Lori.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you and good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors.

I am very pleased to report that 2014 was a very strong year for Sealed Air. We exceeded our financial objectives in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We delivered 8% adjusted EBITDA growth in 2014 and expanded margins by 90 basis points despite currency headwinds. We had favorable price mix in every region and in every division in the quarter and for the full year. We improved the health of our balance sheet and generated over $600 million in free cash flow. We continued on our innovation path including for example Darfresh entre, Instapak Simple, and a new TASKI XP platform. We also announced the relocation of our headquarters to Charlotte, North Carolina and launched a new website. ","These are just some of the many successes that we had over the last 12 months and while we are pleased with our 2014 financial results, we still believe that there is significant improvement to be had in terms of top line potential growth and further margin expansion as well as maximizing our free cash flow generation. But before we review our fourth quarter and year-end results, I want to share some insights on how we are approaching 2015. ","Based on foreign exchange rates today, we are assuming unfavorable currency translation of approximately $550 million in sales and $80 million on EBITDA in 2015. And while we anticipate as reported sales in 2015 to be down approximately 5% compared to 2014, we expect to grow approximately 2.5% in constant currency and are confident that we will deliver adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. EBITDA growth and margin expansion will be driven not only by favorable input cost but also our continued focus on value adding selling, operational disciplines, and earnings quality improvement efforts. ","With that said let me turn back on the fourth quarter and year-end results and Carol will provide of course more details on our 2015 outlook. Let's start with 2014 full year performance by region on slide 4. Net sales were up slightly on an as reported basis and up 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $183 million impact on net sales in 2014. By region, sales in North America increased 3% on a constant currency basis due to 5% growth in Product Care, 2% growth in both Food Care and Diversey Care.","In Europe sales improved on constant currency basis, each quarter throughout the year resulting in a modest increase in constant currency sales in 2014 as compared to a slight decline in 2013. Latin America and AMAT were our fastest growing regions in constant currency sales growth in the middle high -- in the high single digits. Constant currency sales in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand were up 2% in 2014. ","On slide 5, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales declined 2% on an as reported basis but were up 3% in constant currency. Currency translation had a negative $105 million impact on net sales in the quarter compared to $183 million for the full year. Sales in North America were up 2% led by 5% growth in Product Care and 4% growth in Diversey Care. Food Care sales were essentially unchanged compared to last year. Sales in Europe were down 6% on a reported basis and up 2% in constant currency. ","To be more specific on our performance in Europe, let me provide you with country trends on a constant currency basis in the quarter as the UK delivered strong growth of 9% with double-digit growth in Food Care and mid single digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. Spain, Switzerland, and Holland were flat to slightly up while France, Italy, and Germany declined. The seven countries I just referenced accounted for 21% of our fourth quarters consolidated sales and I also would like to highlight that Russia continued to deliver strong growth with net sales in Q4 increasing 5% on an as reported basis which translate to approximately 40% growth in constant currency. ","Moving on to Latin America and AMAT, both regions delivered constant currency sales growth in the high single digit in the quarter, and in AMAT, China, and India delivered double digit sales growth and in Latin America, Brazil, and Mexico delivered mid single digit growth. On an as reported basis, AMAT was up approximately 3% and Latin America down 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of significant currency devaluations. Constant currency sales in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand were up slightly in the quarter, growth in Australia was slightly offset by the decline in New Zealand. ","On slide 6 we learn our price mix volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slides, we had constant currency sales growth and variable price mix in every division and every region in the fourth quarter and in 2014. Food Care had solid performance despite the challenge in the protein market in North America. Constant currency sales in both Diversey Care and Product Care improved each quarter throughout the year. ","We also stayed focused on our commitment to shift our business to a more innovative, value added solutions and provide in best in class service to our customers on a global basis. We have made significant progress on this front but there is still plenty of room for improvement as we continue to evolve into a knowledge based company. You will hear more about all of this at our Analyst Day on June 18, in New York City. ","Turning to our performance by division, I will focus my comments on fourth quarter results on a constant currency basis. On slide 7, Food Care sales increased 3% with approximately 3% in Packaging and 2% in Hygiene. Latin America increased sales by 10% and AMAT increased 2%. Europe had a strong performance with a growth of 5% whereas North America was relatively flat. Developing regions which include Latin America, AMAT, and Eastern European Countries delivered double-digit growth led by strong performance in Argentina, Russia, and China. ","In Europe Packaging sales increased nearly 9% while Hygiene declined 3%. The Protein market was up slightly in the quarter which helped but we also continued to see increased demand for our value added solutions and new platforms. In Hygiene you know that we continued to prune low margin businesses and while this effort impacted top line, it made a significant contribution to our EBITDA margin performance. Food Care adjusted EBITDA in Europe delivered margin expansions of 300 basis points in 2014. This significant improvement was due to a combination of a low margin pruning and operational improvements in our hygiene business as well as the accelerated adoption of our innovative Packaging portfolio. ","In North America cattle and hog production were down approximately 8% and 4% respectively compared to last year. Despite these unfavorable market trends in North America, our sales were relatively flat compared to last year due to favorable product mix and better pricing. To reiterate what we said in our last earnings call, we believe that this cycle is close to the bottom and we expect that the rate of decline to moderate over the next 12 months. ","It is worth noting that on a global basis our three largest market segments fresh red meats, smoked and processed, and poultry delivered sales growth in the quarter and for the full year. Poultry have also been a key growth driver in North America and in Latin America. The strong performance is a direct result of increased demand for our advanced solutions such as Case Ready, Darfresh, Fluids, Grip & Tear, Quick. We introduced Darfresh entre during the fourth quarter and we have already experienced significant traction in both Europe and North America. Darfresh entre is a system solution that reduces food waste into total distribution system while also utilizing less material. ","I want to highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the fourth quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA of $172 million or 17.5% of net sales increased 8% compared to last year. This increase was largely a result of pricing discipline, improved mix, and cost synergies. And for the full year, Food Care's net sales of $3.8 billion increased 4% in constant currency, and was essentially unchanged on an as reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2014 of 17.5% increased 140 basis points over 2013 which is an outstanding performance. And going forward in 2015 we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input cost, and our continued focus on innovation and operational discipline are expected to more than offset the forecast of currency headwinds. ","Slide 8 highlights the result from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on constant currency basis were up 4% in the fourth quarter. Volume and price mix were up approximately 2% each. Developing regions increased 11% led by 16% growth in Latin America and 10% growth in AMAT. Our fastest growing countries were China, India, and Brazil and North America increased sales 4% which is our strongest performance in North America over the last 24 months. ","In Europe sales were essentially unchanged, positive trends in the UK and Switzerland offset by declines in France and Germany. Holland, Italy, and Spain were relatively flat and from an end market perspective on a global basis, our strongest sectors in the quarter were building service contractors and hospitality. We have had a number of solid customer wins that are beginning to ramp up and contribute to our top line results. And during the quarter we introduced amongst others the TASKI XP platform, a standalone -- a stand on, sorry, Floor Care machine that delivers 30% more productivity than the conventional work behind Floor Care machines. ","As you can see, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $58 million or 10.9% of net sales in the quarter. We are beginning to reap the benefits of our targeted investments in R&D and sales and marketing but unfavorable currency translation and certain supply chain cost had a negative impact on margins during that fourth quarter. Diversey Care generates nearly 45% of its sales from Europe and its performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year was negatively impacted by currency declines. ","For the full year Diversey Care's net sales of $2.2 billion increased 3% in constant currency and were essentially unchanged on an as reported basis. But adjusted EBITDA in 2014 of $245 million increased 3% compared to last year. To be noted is that excluding unfavorable currency translation in the fourth quarter and in 2014, Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA was up 5% and 8% respectively. In 2015 we expect Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA growth to be moderated due to its high exposure to the euro. ","Turning to slide 9, Product Care delivered 5% constant currency sales in the fourth quarter, sales growth in the fourth quarter which is at highest growth rate all year. This growth was attributable to favorable price mix of 4% and as we have continued to shift our business towards high performance solutions, including cushioning and packaging systems and continued to focus on improving the quality of our general use business. As we have discussed, growth in e-commerce and third party logistics is increasing demand for our cushioning and packaging systems and we expect these trends to continue going forward. ","If you recall last quarter, I highlighted the Instapak Simple as one of our key innovations that brings the benefit of cost effective, high performance damage reduction to emerging regions and the e-commerce market. This product was successfully launched from October of last year. ","North America which accounts for about 60% of our Product Care business increased sales 5%. Europe represents just over 20% of Product Care sales and had its strongest performance of the year with over 3% growth. AMAT also had its strongest performance of the year with 11% sales growth and AMAT and Japan, Australia, and New Zealand combined account for just under 20% of Product Care sales but it is worth highlighting that both China and Japan had double digit growth in the quarter. Latin America accounts for only 4% of Product Care sales and declined 2% due to the rationalization efforts that were completed during the quarter. ","Adjusted EBITDA increased 6% to $77 million or 79% of net sales. Growth in cushioning and packaging systems along with product and customer rationalization actions in general use had a significant impact on our adjusted EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Every quarter in 2014 we delivered both top line and adjusted EBITDA growth. ","For the full year Product Care\u2019s net sales of $1.7 billion increased 4% in constant currency and 3% on and an as reported basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 10% compared to last year and margins improved 120 basis points to 17.7%. The rates of adjusted EBITDA growth surpassed sales growth throughout the year, underscoring our commitment to securing the appropriate value for our solutions. Going forward in 2015 we expect adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, favorable input cost, and our continuous focus on innovation and operational discipline in general use are expected to more than offset currency headwinds. ","And now let me pass the call to Carol to review our total sales and EBITDA bridges, cash flow, and outlook for 2015. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide 10 and slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales on slide 10, we delivered 2 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and 7.8 billion for the year. On a constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 3% for both periods. Sales growth was attributable to favorable price mix which was 3% or 61 million in the quarter and 3.2% or 249 million for the full year. ","Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods, unfavorable currency translation with 105 million in the quarter and 183 million for the full year. Approximately 20% of our total sales are exposed to the euro, approximately 4% to the Brazilian real, and then we have approximately 2% exposure to both the Russian ruble and the Turkish lira.","Turning to slide 11, for the quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 4% on a year-over-year basis to $282 million or 14.3% of net sales. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price cost spread of $48 million. Cost synergies were $22 million in the quarter. Selling, general, and administrative and other expenses increased by $40 million of which $17 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance based compensation and $14 million was related to salary inflation. Currency translation had a negative $17 million impact on EBITDA in the quarter. Despite currency headwinds we delivered a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to the fourth quarter last year. ","For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% year-over-year to $1.12 or to $1.12 billion or 14.4% of net sales. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price cost spread of 3.2% or $150 million on essentially flat volume. Cost synergies of $97 million were more than offset by an increase in SG&A and other expenses of $127 million of which $46 million was attributable to an increase in incentive performance based compensation and $54 million was related to salary inflation. ","For the full year, currency had a negative impact of $30 million on adjusted EBITDA. Yet we delivered 100 basis point improvement in adjusted gross profit margin and a 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to 2013. ","Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.59 as compared to $0.39 in the fourth quarter last year. 2014 EPS was $1.86 as compared to $1.39 in 2013, an increase of over 30%. The 2014 tax rate of 22% was lower than our previously provided guidance of 27% largely due to the December enactment of credit extenders as well as favorable earnings mix. In 2013 our tax rate was 21%. ","During the fourth quarter 2014 we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares for approximately $50 million at an average price of $36 per share. For the full year, we repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $184 million at an average price of $34 per share. This includes approximately 3.9 million shares purchased from the WRG Asbestos Personal Injury Trust in the second quarter of 2014.","Since the beginning of this year 2015, we have repurchased approximately 498,000 shares for $21 million at an average price of $41 per share. We will continue to be active in the market and have the capacity to buy an additional $69 million in shares through the end of 2015. We continue to evaluate alternatives that will enable us to increase returns to our shareholders and maintain our target leverage of 3.5 to 4 times. ","Now turning to slide 12, free cash flow was a force of $612 million in 2014 excluding the Grace settlement. This compares favorably to a source of 509 million in 2013 due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales improved from 17% at the end of 2013 compared to 14% at the end of 2014. The company focuses its management of operating working capital on a 13 month average target. For the 13 month period ending December 31, 2014, the average for operating working capital as a percent of net sales was 17%. This represents 200 basis point improvement compared to 2013. ","CAPEX was $154 million and cash restructuring cost were $108 million in 2014. Cash payments related to SARs were $21 million as compared with 46 million in the prior year. Cash interest payments in 2014 excluding the settlement were $293 million compared to $290 million in 2013. ","Turning to slide 13, in December 2014 we issued $425 million for 4 and 78 senior notes due 2022 and $425 million, 5 and 8 senior notes due 2024. Net proceeds from the offerings were used to repurchase the 750 million 8 and 8 senior notes. In July, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities. Altogether, these transactions reduced our annualized interest expense by approximately 30 million, provide extended maturities, and increased covenant flexibility. ","Turning to slide 14, our outlook for 2015 is presented. We expect net sales to be approximately 7.4 billion, a decline of approximately 5% on a reported basis but an increase of approximately 2.5% in constant currency. As Jerome mentioned earlier, we estimate an unfavorable impact of approximately 515 million on sales from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.18 as compared to 2014 adjusted EPS of $1.86. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 25% in 2015. ","Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of 1.15 billion to 1.18 billion or approximately 3% to 5.5% growth rate on a reported basis. Currency is estimated to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately 80 million. We are confident that we can achieve the level of EBITDA presented as we continue to focus on our disciplines to improve the quality of earnings and benefit from favorable input cost. Additionally, we expect approximately 50 million in cost synergies most of which will come from the earnings quality and improvement restructuring program. ","In late December our Board approved a new restructuring program, the Fusion Program which will consist of projects across our three divisions as well as functional support. This program is expected to generate savings of approximately 80 million to 85 million by the end of 2018. We do not expect to realize any savings from this program until early 2016. ","The cost of the Fusion Program is expected to be approximately $275 million to $285 million of which the net cash outflow is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. We anticipate the proceeds from asset sales and state incentives to be approximately $65 million. Our guidance for free cash flow is approximately $600 million for 2015 which excludes the tax refund related to the Grace settlement of approximately $245 million. ","Our outlook for free cash flow is derived from higher earnings, improvements in working capital and lower cash interest payments offset by higher restructuring cash cost and capital expenditures as compared to 2014. Cash restructuring cost excluding restructuring CAPEX are expected to be $120 million. This $120 million consists of approximately $50 million from previously announced restructuring programs and approximately $70 million from the new Fusion Program. ","Capital expenditures are expected to be $180 million which includes approximately $45 million of CAPEX related to restructuring activities. In 2014 CAPEX was a $154 million of which approximately $25 million was related to restructuring. The year-over-year increase in CAPEX for 2015 as compared to 2014 excluding the restructuring activities I just mentioned is associated with target growth projects for Food Care, Product Care, and Diversey Care and R&D pilot plant and the second phase of our ERP implementation. Cash interest payments are expected to be $255 million and cash taxes are expected to be $110 million. ","Before I open the call to questions I would to like to remind you that our first quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April the 28th at 8:30 AM and Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care Division will be joining us for that discussion. We are also hosting our Analyst Day on Thursday, June the 18th in New York City as previously mentioned. I look forward to speaking with you again in the near future. With that operator can you please open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. ","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey, guys good morning. ","Jerome Peribere","Good morning Ghansham.","Carol Lowe","Good morning. ","Ghansham Panjabi","Good morning sir, just first off could you just give us a sense as to what the volume outlook by an operating segment is for 2015 as it relates to your guidance and I guess that\u2019s related, your guidance is for 2.5% constant currency growth given where resin and kind of what it\u2019s doing right now and some of your pass through in your contracts, is it fair to expect a negative price mix bios partially portfolio for the year? Thanks. ","Jerome Peribere","Good question Ghansham. So our volume for 2015 is going to be at about 1.5% or so. And this compares with zero volume growth that we had in 2014 and about slightly higher than 1% in 2013. We are going to see volume growth in the three divisions, led by Diversey Care and Product Care and also some in Food Care. So, the story of price mix is going to be somewhat different than the one of 2014 because obviously the resin prices have been and are coming down and as a result of that it is not so much price which is going to be important into 2015 but just margin and margin expansion. And we do believe that we are going to be having margin expansion from all kind of things. ","Number one, we need to remember that we are in a recovery mode. We have lost a lot of pricing over the past few years and we need to rehabilitate pricing. This is true for what I would call the commodity parts of our portfolio specifically in Product Care and in Food Care. ","In Product Care we still have a whole segment which is we call the general use which I would tend to call the more commoditized type of product lines and those were as they have been doing better in 2014, they are far from being at an acceptable level. So, we are going to be holding very firm and we are holding very firm on our pricing. We will only respond to competitive aggression and that's all we are going to do. ","On Food Care, we do have some regional weaknesses in some product lines and that is what we are going to be addressing on pricing. Obviously currency translation is hurting and as they all continue to go down because the dollar is revaluating regularly amongst almost all currencies. We are in need to adjust our pricing. ","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Go ahead please. ","John McNulty","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. With regard to resin prices having come off, have you started to see any of your customers potentially upgrade their products at this point. I know there was a lot of kind of down shifting of products that they were looking at when oil prices and resin ran up. So have you seen the reverse of that yet, and is it something you are expecting as you look into 2015?","Jerome Peribere","Good morning John, I can't precisely answer your question other than make the following comments. We are working very hard at addressing the customer needs depending on the segment they want to touch. So, some -- you take Food Care as an example, some customers want more shelf life and as they want more shelf life, they need to work great in the quality of the products. ","Some others want portion size with potentially less shelf life but improving compared to what is on the shelf today. This is a real strong trend right now and so on. So, what we have in Sealed Air now is a whole commercial organization absolutely obsessed with understanding and satisfying customer needs. So it is going to really be on a case by case basis and more than a general approach which by the way I haven\u2019t been told that this is the case, in terms of grading generally speaking the packaging. ","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America. Go ahead please. ","George Staphos","Thanks everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details and taking my question. Congratulations on the year. I guess maybe related to what Ghansham was getting at, if I take the midpoint of your range for 2015 from a margin standpoint, it is up roughly about 130 basis points if I did my math correctly versus 2014 despite the foreign exchange headwinds. So Jerome and Carol, as we think about how you have confidence in that goal which you said you did is most of the progress towards that going to come from mix and further value selling or will more of it come from productivity or other buckets and within that how would we think about the mixture across the three segments? And the last thing is, sounds like Diversey will have a tough time growing this year because of FX, would you confirm that or add color, thank you and good luck in the quarter?","Jerome Peribere","Thanks George, good to talk to you. What the big hitter, the big hitter in 2015 is obviously that we\u2019re going to have more than half a billion dollars of currency translation. Just imagine, just go back one second to the fourth quarter and imagine us publishing a constant currency EBITDA number of about $300 million in the fourth quarter which is what you would get if you add the $280 million and the $17 million of EBITDA currency translation loss. So we would have all celebrated an extraordinary quarter. ","I can assure you that we would have just blown away our numbers on a constant currency basis for 2015. But life is what it is and we have felt what\u2019s coming actually very early in September actually and we have started very early to take measures hence our Fusion project. To come to the point, $550 million and more possibly of foreign currency translation equally balanced by volume about $100 million and price mix. So that\u2019s the way we are seeing it. We are going to stay very firm in prices first of all because resin is not the only component of our cost. It is only a part of it. We have -- we are a highly serviced company. As a result of that we have a lot of manpower, we have 25,000 employees or 24,000 employees in this company, and therefore you remember my comment of two years ago about the salary match increase year-on-year. So this is a big part of the cost. And we have conversion cost, etc. ","Coming on to Diversey Care well by definition with 45% of our sales in Europe we are exposed to currency and the translation that I just talked about. And therefore we are anticipating a slight improvement in our profitability in dollar basis. Having said that let me remind you that we are very clearly on the right track as proven in 2013. EBITDA improvement and as proven in our 2014 EBITDA growth as we have in constant currency, we have grown about 8%. So we are making wins in the field, it happens in the field but we are very focused on margin improvement in that business which is the thing which is going to last overtime no matter what currency is doing. ","Carol Lowe","And George I\u2019ll just add just to remind everyone we highlighted the 80 million EBITDA foreign exchange expected negative hit year-over-year in our 2015 guidance. In addition for a couple of years now we have talked very publicly that we have approximately around 60 million in annual inflationary cost related to wages benefits. So if take those two as cost increases to go from the 1.18 billion to the guidance we\u2019ve provided for EBITDA for 2015, that tells you and then you take the 50 million positive for cost synergies, you can do the math and see what\u2019s remaining and that it\u2019s all coming. A lot of good benefit from mix and price cost spread as well as the volume growth that Jerome highlighted for both benefitting the company and again staying firm on our good practices and policies and the cultural changes that we\u2019re making. Also I\u2019ll just mention real quickly back to John\u2019s question, because of the great advances of technology I got an update from our President of our Product Care Division to answer about the quality of the products and he -- if not meaningfully up but we are starting to see a shift towards some of our core view products for e-commerce which is a much higher quality product as well as our inflatable bubble which is also higher quality than some of our general use products. So we are starting to see a little bit of that trend but it is still very minor at this point. ","George Staphos","Thank you, Carol. ","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Please proceed. ","Scott Gaffner","Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to look backwards and look forwards around your pricing initiatives. I mean if I look back to 2014 maybe even over the last 18 months a lot of your pricing initiatives look like they came on the back of higher resin, maybe that made it a little bit easier for you, maybe it made it made it more difficult, but can you talk about what the decline in resin means as far as pricing initiatives going forward and can you also talk about what sort of benefits if you were to maintain pricing you would get from lower resin, thanks?","Jerome Peribere","So, I am not Scott going to go too much in details there for obvious competitive reasons. But what we have embarked into is a whole program of margin restoration. I said some time ago that we were not having reinvestment economics and we did need -- we do need to have that. This is the very basis of proper business management. So we have gotten pricing as a result of resins and we have gotten other type of pricings at the very same time. ","In the future, we have in Europe for example last year, sorry before coming to the future, we had last year pricing power also in Europe despite a very poor environment. So, this company is in transformation and it is on the way of doing two things in a very disciplined way. The first one is good business management. You saw it in terms of margin expansion, we need margin expansion because we have -- because they have dramatically deteriorated in the past. And we are going to continue to be doing this. We are going to have mixed improvement because by definition we are not putting the resources on our lower margin products, we are shifting them towards higher margin products. And we are doing working capital management. ","You have seen what we have done in just one year, we moved 300 basis points from 14% of operating working capital -- from 17% operating working capital to 14%. And this is -- and we are continuing to do this kind of things. And at the very same time we have started to reinvent this company and this company is not going to be just about more plastic. It is going to be about the cutting edge of the technologies which will enable our customers to win. That is what we are going towards. That should give them higher margins and give us higher margins. ","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo. Please proceed. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Good morning, this is actually Gayle Barn [ph] for Chris. Congratulations on the year. Just had a question about the state of economy across the world with the U.S. kind of emerging as being holding more strong and some of the developing regions being a little bit fragile and how you expect to sort of -- what regions and\/or product lines you expect to get the 1.5% volume growth that you talked about?","Jerome Peribere","Okay, well Chris good question and good morning. Well the buzz word which is not mine which is everybody's is volatility. I got it all wrong in fourth quarter when in October I said that we were anticipating, we were already into the fourth quarter and we were anticipating $10 million negative EBITDA as a result of currency translation. We got $17 million, almost double. During the fourth quarter our average exchange rate for the euro was 126 and the real at 247, the ruble at 43. Guess what, the ruble is at 66 today, the euro is at 113, the Brazilian real is at 281. So more volatile than that, I don\u2019t know. So which is why I am stopping making projections on resin prices for example, on currencies, etc and our exchange rates for 2015 are at around those levels that we have today although possibly just a little bit more conservative. ","So where is it going to grow, we have \u2013- we are expecting innovation to pull us and actually in Food Care the innovation has already pulled us. Pull our results and our product mix which is going really well. We are going to see a deceleration of the beef cycle, negative beef cycle so things should be improving a little bit in volume in North America. And we should see the hogs business have a little bit of growth in North America which would be all good. Real at 280 is good for meat exports and for local profitability. So we should benefit a little bit about this. ","In Diversey Care we are continuing to eliminate low margin businesses and at the same time we have had a few solid customer wins and in hospitality we\u2019re going to have even more on healthcare, in the kitchen and on TASKI. So I am positive there, we should have some volume growth there. We continue to grow volume and nicely in emerging countries. In Latin America, in TASKI we have been hurt by very fast devaluations but we\u2019re up in reported dollars in AMAT and we are growing very, very nicely in quite a few countries down there. ","And in Product Care we have -- Carol talked about our core view line. We have some specialty packaging there which are doing very well and our systems which are doing extremely well also. And that\u2019s where we are planning to shift. You have seen that we had growth in Product Care in Europe which didn\u2019t have for a while. We think we have a lot of momentum in North America and intend to do that. And by the way also in Asia on our Product Care division we are extremely optimistic that we\u2019re going to be succeeding there. ","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please?","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning and congratulations on another great year. When you look at the working capital squeeze, Carol you mentioned you got it down to 17% of sales. Could you give us and about 90 million or so I guess last year what should we look for in 2015 and 2016 and then just quickly if you could give us a breakdown of the 97 million in cost saves last year, how that was split between the EQIP Program and the one from back in 2011 I guess it was called the IOP Program?","Carol Lowe","Alright, so good morning Chip. As we think about the working capital, it contributed approximately $168 million for 2014 for our free cash flow and for 2013, it was about $145 million. And as we look towards 2015, if you go kind of looking at the $600 million that we guided we would anticipate if you do the math taking into account I gave you CAPEX and restructuring, payments, interest payments you\u2019re going to come right somewhere around 110 million expected benefit from working capital management. We still are slightly over a 100 million and pass due receivables. So we expect some of that benefit to come from continuing to decrease our past dues. If you recall we finished 2012 at over 200 million so we\u2019ve made great progress but there is still some additional progress that we can make. ","Also our management of inventory, we feel like there are continuing opportunities as we make our processes more robust around our sales and operations planning as well as SKU optimization. We also had some investments in inventory as we started to implement some of our new distribution programs that our supply chain team is working on. So, as we make those transitions, at times we carry slightly higher levels of inventory and then we right size those. So, we did have that right at year end. So, we do have opportunities in both. Our payables, we have made great progress in increasing our days table outstanding and we will continue to focus on that as well where it makes sense and where we have large dollar spend and large volume. ","In terms of the $97 million in savings that we provided for the improvement from 2013 to 2014 for cost synergies most of that, a large portion of that came from our EQIP Program. We still had a little bit trailing from our integration and optimization program, but the larger portion was from the EQIP Program. And as we looked to 2015, as we noted almost all of that 50 million in cost synergies will come from the EQIP Program as well with the new Fusion Program starting to give us the positive return at the beginning as we move into 2016. ","The new program has an internal rate of return in excess of 40% so we are really excited about what that's going to bring to our cost structure as well.","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Philip NG of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Alex Hutter","Good morning, this is Alex Hutter on for Phil, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the quarter. One of your public competitors in Food appears to be taking a more proactive stance on price, which was encouraging but can you provide some color on competitive activity in Food Care and Product Care and based on those dynamics do you expect to or have you seen any players ceding price to gain share with resin prices falling?","Jerome Peribere","There are some skirmishes in the field here and there by definition and -- but I would say nothing notable. Every company pursues its own strategy. We are not going to lose business that we don\u2019t want to lose. But we are the leader therefore we have to be conservative on price reduction. And as I said before, our strategy is to recoup the margins that we have lost in the past and that's what we really want to do?","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please. ","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli Company. Please proceed. ","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good morning and congratulations. ","Carol Lowe","Good morning Rosemarie. ","Jerome Peribere","Thank you. ","Rosemarie Morbelli","I was wondering Jerome you said something to the effect that rebuilds were above your expectations for both the quarter and the year. And I was wondering if you could give us a little more details on the areas where you were surprised on the positive side and whether there were some negative surprise which were more than offset by the positive ones?","Jerome Peribere","Okay, Rosemarie good question again. The -- what surprised is not so much the results but -- because the result -- because the financials are the consequence of what we are doing. What surprises me is the speed at which from Q3 to Q4 of 2013 this organization has shifted its mind. And this organization is now a courageous organization. We have our people who believe, our people who see how we are winning and how we can continue to win. Have taken the responsibility of the price leadership and of the product mix leadership and of the need for innovation and therefore things are moving at a pace which is very different than from the past. And I could see that. As I said, sometimes late Q3, early Q4 of last year and therefore you now are seeing the results that we had. ","We started in the first quarter but in fact it amplified throughout the year. You should, as we have said during the prepared remarks, our Product Care and Diversey Care business had constant currency sales improving every single quarter. In Q1 our Diversey Care business improved in constant currency by 1.2% in Q1 of 2014. It went up and up and up and in the fourth quarter of 2014 it went up by 4%. And this is obviously something extremely important. And the same with our Product Care which started the year at 2.6% and finished the year at 4.6%. And this is extremely important because there is a change in pace, there is more courage in the organization, etc. Doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s going to continue to go crescendo like this because we have as I said before a very volatile environment and so on. ","So we are not going to take currency as an excuse, we have to do what we have to do. We are going to continue doing and forging ahead through a disciplined approach to our business to improve operationally and to start building and we have started that to start building the future. So as to what didn\u2019t go that well, I would say I am not going to contradict myself with what I said before because I have been really positively surprised as to how we are gaining -- how we are making this cultural change and stuff. ","So the negative are uncontrollable factors and I don\u2019t control currency and I don\u2019t control the overall economy. Having said that we were not expecting the economy to improve much better, so this is going to be considered as a plus if it does come. It has been here since the last two to three years and we believe that in 2015 it is going to continue to be here. ","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please proceed.","Lori Chaitman","Operator?","Operator","Hello. Can I just confirm it Anthony Pettinari or you want me to? I am assuming they don\u2019t wish to take the call, shall I forward the next call through to you. ","Lori Chaitman","Yes, let\u2019s take the last question please. ","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Al Kabili of Macquarie. Please proceed. ","Al Kabili","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess Jerome you mentioned that this year is much more about margin than it is about price given the situation with the resin outlook, that said in your outlook how do you think of 2015 as far as, are we getting an outsized resin benefit this year that then makes it more difficult to expand dollar margins next year or do you very much see 2015 as very much part of the normal progression in the EBITDA margin expansion and so you would still look to continue to grow margins in 2016 as well? Thanks. ","Jerome Peribere","So, we are ahead of our schedule. You remember that when we had our Investor Day in September of 2013, we have given guidance with regards to our EBITDA margins. We are going to be there and more in 2015. So we are ahead of our schedule. The way it\u2019s going to happen is going to slightly different temporarily but we are continuing to have the same kind of approach to what we wanted to have. But that\u2019s important to understand. I am going to stop making predictions on the resins because in Q4 I was wrong and it is soft in Q1. There are wide discrepancies depending on the parts of the world which will have to be corrected. And next to that you have -- it can turn upside down very quickly depending on the demand in Asia, depending on a few factors here and there you could see resin prices move backup and therefore we have to be very careful with any price concession because as we all know it is much easier to go down then to go up. And these things can turnaround very, very quickly.","We are resolutely on our way to 20% EBITDA in the mid to long-term. I really believe that with our Get Fit initiatives and with our Change the Game initiatives which are going to start to bear fruit in a meaningful way in 2016, 2017 and from there, we are going to have a portfolio which is going to be fairly different with new and differentiated technologies which should give our customers a differential advantage and improved profitability for ourselves too.

And we encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call as well. Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors, and many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find on our website at sealedair.com. We also discussed financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.","And lastly, we have used pro forma results for certain metrics in the first quarter to aid in the comparison of our performance to historical combined metrics of Sealed Air and Diversey. These pro forma results are also available supplements in our earnings release, which also can be found on our website. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Hickey, our CEO. Bill?","William V. Hickey","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning to everyone on the call. During this morning's call, I'll try to give our update on our progress in achieving our full year 2012 targets and highlights of our sales performance through the first quarter. Tod will then follow me with additional detail on the financial results, liquidity measures and key balance sheet items. We'll then follow that with opportunities for questions from both the callers on the telephone lines, as well as our webcast participants, who are invited to text in any questions you might have.","Our first quarter ought to demonstrate to you our focus on 2012 objectives of integrating the Diversey business, achieving our adjusted EBITDA goals and on reducing our debt. We are realizing higher synergies as a result of the outstanding progress our teams have made in transitioning the organization into 3 new businesses, which will be leveraging shared platform of functional support, including optimized global supply chain network, as well as an integrated and shared R&D, HR and information technology functions among others. Additionally, we have increased the size of the overall benefits of the program in 2012, as well as through 2014 as our integrations teams continue to finalize the details of their respective programs. ","These cost synergies, combined with the focus on execution on core business plans, organic growth in all segments and regions, drove first quarter EBITDA results that are pacing within our plan and are still in line for us to achieve our 2012 targets for adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and our adjusted and cash earnings per share guidance ranges. ","Let me take a minute to look at some of the key metrics that we are following. In the quarter, we achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $236 million, or about 12.3% adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter. This represents steady performance on $1 and margin basis versus pro forma results in the first quarter of 2011, even though market conditions and input costs have become more challenging in the first quarter of 2012. We're also comfortable with our free cash flow and net debt outlook and continue to expect to generate $450 million to $475 million of free cash flow in 2012. Tod will discuss additional details on our cash flow after my comments. ","Lastly, we prepay $31 million of our outstanding term loans in the quarter, staying a year ahead on our payment installments and remaining committed on using cash to pay down debt. Looking at earnings per share, we did report a loss of $0.03 per share in the quarter but that did include the impact of $0.21 of special items including integration costs and restructuring costs. Excluding the impact of the special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.18 and of course, that does include the effect of purchase price amortization, which on an after-tax basis, approximately $0.11 per share. ","Reported sales for the quarter were $1.92 billion, reflecting a 4% increase in constant dollar sales from our legacy Sealed Air business. Two of that came from higher price, and 2% of that came from higher volumes. I'm particularly pleased that we're able to report positive volume in all of our businesses in what many industry peers have not been able to do. ","On a pro forma basis, sales increased 1% or approximately 3% on a constant dollar basis as currency was a headwind for us in the quarter. All regions reported growth with 2% constant dollar sales in the North America, 1% growth in the EMEA region and developing regions achieved a 9% growth with solid performance in Latin America, Southeast Asia, India and the Middle East, which includes Turkey, Egypt and the UAE. Our volume growth reflected our ability to hold or expand our market presence in each of our businesses and largely perform above industry and customer production rates, as our market-facing teams continue to execute on their growth programs. These include achieving our targeted top line synergies where we have achieved just under $10 million to date on an annual rate, but we are tracking above plan as we only expected top line synergies to materialize in the second quarter and beyond. ","Although still early and ahead of plan, our food and beverage team has already signed over 10 customers that include large multinationals and local regional food processors in 4 regions of the world. Of note, volume growth in Protective Packaging North America was quite strong due to the excess of our innovative solutions, new growth programs and equipment sales that served a strong e-commerce sector and more modest growth in the core industrial sector. ","Diversey also had strong pockets of growth, most notably in the developing regions of the world and in growth programs targeting expanded presence in key global accounts. TASKI brand floor care innovations was a particular note in the quarter as we expanded that line into Asia. We also succeeded in nearly doubling our sales through our new partner alliances with Synthos, Staples and GE Water. Although starting off on a small base, this pace suggests a solid start to our second year with our new strategic partners. ","Additionally, our Food Packaging and Food Solutions segments are showing strong resilience despite low to modest customer production rates, and we've done that with ongoing innovation in new products and a continuing 9% increase in case-ready and an 8% increase in fluid packaging solutions on a global basis. ","Looking specifically at the Diversey segment on a pro forma basis, we achieved 1% constant dollar sales growth from 3% higher pricing and 2% lower volume in the quarter, a trend that is slightly better than fourth quarter results and suggest a stabilization in Europe. The Diversey segment exhibited particular strength in a number of areas, as 85% of Diversey's revenue base did demonstrate 2% to 3% constant dollar sales growth on a global basis and these same areas of the business also achieved approximately 10% to 20% growth in the developing regions of the world. The sector showing the strength include the distribution channel, food and beverage, food service and lodging and laundry. As an example, food service grew 3% globally, and 20% in developing parts of the world. ","Food and beverage grew 2% globally and 10% in the core developing region of the world, including Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, Turkey and Africa. Regional highlights include a 6% constant dollar sales growth rate in Asia-Pacific and 8% growth rate in Latin America where, in particular in Latin America, we achieved a 20% growth in retail and a 30% growth in the Food Service sector. ","Clearly, there were some offsets to these solid gains, and the areas of weakness reflect the ongoing challenge in the EMEA region, primarily economic weakness in Europe, which makes up about 80% of our EMEA region. And the sectors that are showing the greatest strength were the Building Service Contractors segment at 2%, the Food and Beverage sector and the distribution channel, which both grew at 3% and the laundry and lodging sector at 6%. Food service held steady year-over-year, but we expect improvement in the second quarter. ","The positive growth in these regions and these sectors was definitely impacted by weaknesses in the sectors that we noted in the fourth quarter. The Education and Government sector, which has been impacted by austerity measures in several governments across Europe, lower volume and licensed consumer brands in Europe, which we sell through big-box stores and distribution, and in retail and healthcare. Unique to the first quarter was a significant volume decline in North America, specifically due to a shift in timing of 2 custom orders in the first quarter. These were very specific cases, which impacted the first quarter but will normalize later in Q2. ","North American volumes on the Diversey side were also modestly impacted by one food and beverage customer's closing of their facilities related to the media concerns associated with lean, finely textured beef, and we are currently not expecting that customer to come back on to manufacturing in 2012 and will probably continue to unfavorably impact North American volumes for the balance of the year. ","Across all of our business, the price\/mix was a solid contributor with all businesses generating positive price in the quarter from prior actions taken in 2011, and all business achieved positive price cost spread in the quarter. Our businesses have pursued additional pricing actions in Q1 and some going into effect in Q2, but many of those benefits will not be realized until late in the second quarter. These pricing actions seek to continue to recover residual 2011 higher cost and our ongoing assumption of additional raw material inflation of 3% to 5% in 2012. ","In the first quarter, raw material inflation ran slightly below that range. We do favorable supply\/demand in the industry, however, higher raw material prices did go into effect at the end of the first quarter, and we expect to see that impact in the second quarter. ","Looking specifically at pricing performance in the Diversey business in the quarter, the team successfully generated pricing benefits that exceeded first quarter material costs and recovery costs from the first -- from the fourth quarter of 2011. However, this benefit was offset at the operating profit line from unfavorable product mix and lower product volume. The mix effect was primarily due to lower volumes in the quarter from Europe, particularly from more favorable product applications such as floor care. As noted earlier, we implemented incremental pricing actions in the first quarter, which we expect to realize the benefits of in the latter portion of the second quarter. ","Additionally, peak seasonal volumes in the second quarter with the sales mix of approximately 26% are expected to offset some of the unfavorable mix going forward, as should the higher use of certain more favorable products to the summer and autumn months. For example, floor care products are more heavily bought in the summer for school refurbishing during the summer break and in early third quarter for retail stores prepping for holiday season traffic. ","Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we are confident we're executing solidly on our core objectives of integrating the Diversey business, achieving our synergies and reducing our debt. We also will continue to rebuild credibility with our customers, both locally and globally, through innovative solutions and expanding our developing region reach. ","We are excited that our new organizational design and synergy opportunities are being achieved at an accelerated rate and the vision for Sealed Air is beginning to resonate with our customers. Our businesses and teams are very engaged in not only finalizing their new organizations but staying focused on our customers and expanding our market presence through leading market-facing teams and a global footprint and an innovation pipeline and growth programs. ","A simple example of this is in our North American Food and Beverage business, which is transitioning into a new business unit with Diversey, was also able to launch 4 new products in the first quarter and were recognized with an achievement award by the Flexible Packaging Association at the same time. ","I am proud to say that our Food and Beverage business is not unique as each of our businesses has developed an extensive portfolio of opportunities through our core R&D efforts. We've been working aggressively in the last 6 months calling on our target customers, piloting new products and engaging in a number of bids to incorporate Sealed Air into our customers' operations. Although these efforts are not in our first quarter results, we are seeing a strong pipeline that complements our core business and a stronger roadmap for our business leaders as our customers clearly want alternatives to the status quo. What is also exciting is that just over 180 days post-close, customers will see our food and beverage and institutional laundry teams as one organization at the National Restaurant Association, which convenes over the weekend. ","Here, we will outline to food processors and food service organizations how they can leverage our unique position, to protect, enhance and differentiate their products and their operations with the unique portfolio of solutions that encompass product protection, food and workplace safety, sustainability and operating efficiency. ","At the National Restaurant show, where we're featuring a number of new Diversey and Cryovac-branded food-oriented solutions that include cleaning and hygiene solutions designed to address worker safety, productivity and sustainability through dosing and dispensing control system, our hand care system, as well as ovenable packaging and a pre-plated Ready Meal microwavable solution. ","While we are encouraged by our progress to date and are tracking close to plan in the first quarter, we are cautious on the macroeconomic outlook for the balance of the year, and are maintaining our current adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and net debt targets, as well as our adjusted and cash EPS in ranges. ","Although our synergies are higher than anticipated and our tax rate is more favorable than expected, any possible upside to our results if economic conditions improve because of the near-term macro uncertainties in Europe, we are holding to our initial range. ","Moving past the seasonally-low first quarter, we expect sales, adjusted EBITDA and earnings to be more pronounced in the second half of the year, accelerated from improving seasonal trends, higher price benefits and a flow-through of the higher level of our cost synergies. ","In April, our business appeared to be generally trending to first quarter organic sales results, which sets our expectations for approximately a 3% to 4% constant dollar growth on our 2 Food businesses, a 4% to 5% growth in Protective Packaging, and approximately 3% constant dollar growth in the Diversey business. This is slightly lower than initially anticipated and largely reflects uncertainty in the economic outlook. These top line assumptions continue to produce a full year sales range of approximately $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion, and we are more comfortable at the lower end of this range. ","Now at this time, I'll pass the call over to Tod Christie, our Treasurer and Interim CFO, to discuss first quarter financial results and the integration program in more detail.","Tod S. Christie","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional details on our first quarter results, and then I'll also address details of key balance sheet, free cash flow and liquidity items. ","As you may have seen in our press release, our adjusted EBITDA was $236 million in the first quarter, which was even with pro forma results for the first quarter of 2011 and pacing within our plan. In our supplemental tables that are attached to the press release, we've provided adjusted operating profit plus depreciation and amortization at the segment level, which provides a reasonable approximation of each segment's contribution to adjusted EBITDA. Looking at these results, we achieved improved performance on both an absolute dollar and margin basis in our Food and Protective segments as a result of higher sales and increased operating profits. ","Together, these segments improved their year-over-year performance by 10% or $15 million. On a pro forma basis, Diversey's performance declined by $16 million to $50 million as a result of lower volumes and mix, which Bill noted a few minutes ago, factors that we expect will improve as the year progresses. ","Now I'd like to turn your attention to free cash flow and liquidity items. Free cash flow was $30 million in the first quarter and was $26 million lower than the first quarter of 2011 due to an increase in interest payments and higher capital expenditures to support our larger business. Changes in working capital items resulted in the net use of cash of $35 million in the quarter, as we increased inventories in preparation for the start-up of our European principal company structure and experienced our normal seasonal build in other regions and businesses. ","Receivables generated $56 million of cash in the quarter as a result of lower sequential sales. I'm pleased to note that our receivables portfolio continued to perform well in spite of the economic challenges in Europe. Cash and cash equivalents were $530 million at March 31, down $184 million from December 31, 2011. In addition to being our seasonal low quarter from an operational standpoint, the first quarter is typically characterized by above-average disbursements.","During the quarter, we paid $116 million of interest, more than 1\/3 of the total $320 million that we anticipated paying during the year. We also paid $55 million under long-term and annual incentive compensation plans, $31 million for our first quarter 2013 term loan prepayments, $26 million to pay our restructuring obligations under our Integration & Optimization Program, and $25 million for our quarterly dividends. ","As we noted in the press release today, we continue to target 2012 annual free cash flow of $450 million to $475 million. We expect that free cash flow will improve over the balance of the year, particularly in the second half, through a combination of improved operating performance, normal seasonal business trends, realization of additional cash benefits through achievement of our synergies, and continued focus on working capital improvements. ","As of March 31, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.3 billion. Our net debt was $5.3 billion in March 31, reflecting normal seasonal uses of cash and prepayments of our first quarter 2013 installments on our term loans as we continue our plans to stay a year ahead of our bank loan repayments. We continue to target the use of the substantial majority of our free cash flow for debt repayments after providing for our dividend payments and restructuring obligations. And in April, we paid our second quarter 2013 term loan installments. ","Today, we went live with our European principal company structure for our Diversey European operations. This is an important milestone and represents the culmination of many months of hard work by the project teams. In the first quarter, we recognized $5 million in costs related to the implementation of this program, which we've included in special items. We anticipate that future benefits from this reorganization will arise from more efficient management and lower overhead costs from a centralized management team and supply chain model, as well as tax savings. ","In summary, we remain well positioned to fund day-to-day operations of our new combined company, return cash to our shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend and prepay our outstanding term loans. ","You may have seen that W.R. Grace has recently completed settlement agreements with certain claimants and has requested approval of the bankruptcy court. While we view this as a positive development, there are other outstanding appeals, and the funding date of our obligation remains uncertain. However, we continue to stand ready to fund the pending W.R. Grace settlement upon Grace's emergence from bankruptcy. ","And now, I'll turn the microphone back to Bill to open the call to your questions.","William V. Hickey","Great. Thanks, Tod. I would like to add Tod's compliments to the European team that's been working for months on bringing live our EPC. Today is day one of the go live. So to our European team and EPC members, thank you for the hard work you've put in on this. ","With that though, operator, I would like to open the call up to questions from the participants, and I will also look in the text questions that come in from our webcast participants as well. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have our first question, it's from the line of Ghansham Panjabi from Robert W Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bill, on your comment that the first quarter EBITDA was in line with your internal plan, how did the first quarter progress by operating segment? Because it looks like Diversey was weaker, so I guess what was better?","William V. Hickey","Food was -- actually, the core Sealed Air business, I think was ahead of most of The Street's expectations. Protective North America was up 9% in terms of volume, which is pretty good. So I'd say the protective side is running ahead of plan. Diversey side is running a little bit behind, and that's primarily Europe, Ghansham, and as I said, we're running close to plan, we're not at plan, but we're clearly within reach.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And so the first quarter EBITDA, which is roughly flat year-over-year on your new adjusted EBITDA calculation, you're still backing $1.2 billion, that's roughly $120 million delta year-over-year just based on your restated numbers. So on a percentage basis, as we look through the last 3 quarters, is it sort of 20, 40, 40 for the last 3 quarters, how should we think about that?","William V. Hickey","Ghansham, I was looking at that number before, and I haven't done the math in detail or actually have. First quarter is about 20%, and it should have been a little bit higher than that. It should have been a couple of points higher than 20%. But it generally run kind of low-20s, picks up to the mid-20s. Third quarter probably drops down at just below 25% and fourth quarter probably pushes 27%, 28%. That's the percent of the year, about.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, Bill, on the second quarter, what's the biggest month of the quarter?","William V. Hickey","Biggest month of the quarter, historically, has been May.","Tod S. Christie","If I could just, Ghansham, add to Bill's comment. On the pacing, what you'll see a little bit more exaggerated result this year because of the growing synergies over the course of the year.","William V. Hickey","Synergies, correct. Yes. I gave you seasonality from operating the business, and I think as Tod clearly pointed out, most of the synergies are second half of the year because we have people scheduled to leave through the end of June.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Philip Ng from Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Appreciate the color on the seasonality. Just want to get a sense of the Diversey business because I used -- and there's some onetime issues it sounds like for North America. But if you take the $50 million EBITDA run rate for Diversey and you bake in the full year guide for synergies, I get to like a 210 number. That's well short of the 345 that you guys delivered last year. So what's a realistic EBITDA number for 2012, flattish, down? Just give me some color on that.","William V. Hickey","Tod?","Tod S. Christie","Yes. I don't think we provide guidance at the\u2026","William V. Hickey","At the EBITDA level by segment, yes. I think that's probably how we're going to answer it, Philip.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fine. In terms of the mix issue in Diversey, it sounds like you're seeing a little more weakness in Europe. That's a higher-margin business. Can you give us some color on what's the margin delta for Europe versus, let's say, North America in your emerging markets business?","William V. Hickey","Europe is, I'd say, it's several hundred basis points. I don't have the exact number here in front of me, but several hundred basis points. Yes. And Europe benefits from scale. I mean, like our principal competitor, who was very heavily leveraged in the U.S. and generally has higher profitability in the U.S., we're the inverse that we have higher profitability in Europe because we can leverage the scale.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just one last final question for Tod. On the free cash flow, you guys reiterated the free cash flow number for the full year. But what about the cash cost around restructuring? Is it still around the $100 million number?","Tod S. Christie","Yes. We -- yes, we actually bumped that up a little bit to $115 million, and that's reflective of the increased target synergies for this year. So the way to think of it is, we bumped this year's benefit up by $20 million, and the cash cost up by $15 million.","Operator","Next question is from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America.","Benjamin C. Wong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Benjamin Wong. George is traveling. First question is on Diversey pricing. Can you elaborate more on pricing expectations for the rest of the year assuming price costs spread should be positive and should maintain its momentum, but any more details would be appreciated.","William V. Hickey","Yes, Diversey had $20 million of price in Q1, and I think their target number for price in the full year is something in the $70 million range, but we'll see how raw material and inflation comes out. But it's actually $20 million realized in Q1.","Benjamin C. Wong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And can you comment about the raw material inflation in the Diversey business? I think it was somewhat flat last quarter. But are you expecting it to decline in the rest of the year?","William V. Hickey","Yes. Raw material inflation actually in the first quarter was only $3 million to $5 million. So, a little below expectations, closer to $5 million. And we do expect raw material inflation to go up in the 3% to 5% range over the balance of the year.","Benjamin C. Wong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and just a quick follow up on the timing shift for the customers in North America and Diversey, what would have Diversey volumes looked like if there wasn't a shift?","William V. Hickey","If I were to take the 2 of them, it would probably be 0.5% different.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays Capital.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the price discussion at Diversey. Can you remind us how the contracts work there? I mean, what sort of the lag on price versus cost realization, and have you done much work on improving those contracts over the last couple of years? I think that was maybe part of the margin improvement at Diversey before you actually acquired the company.","William V. Hickey","The industry, historically, if I go back long before Sealed Air acquired the company, there were about once a year adjustments. And I think both prior to Sealed Air's acquisition, as well as since Sealed Air's acquisition, we brought those to a more timely basis. I mean, they're still at this point a mix of them, some are quarterly, some are semiannually and some are negotiation as situations come up in terms of having caps and floors. So I would say it's closer to the cost inflation than it used to be, but it's not simultaneous. So you still have a little bit of a lag, but it's looking similar to the Sealed Air lag we say about a quarter.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And is any of this pricing coming from actual price realization above cost inputs?","William V. Hickey","Well I said -- we said there's $20 million in the quarter and some of that is, honestly, follow on from last year's cost inflation. If you remember, Diversey came out of the quarter Q4 at something like $13 million behind the price cost curve. And so some of the $20 million in the Q1 was catching up on that as I mentioned in my comments.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly looking at the Diversey synergy targets, you obviously took them up in the quarter. But how much of that is actually related to the weaker sales environment in Europe, or is it more related towards the new European business structure? I mean, can you sort of frame that for us?","William V. Hickey","Yes. We have not made any changes directly related to the European sales situation now. These are really additional things we found as the teams are putting together their organizations down at the third and fourth level of the organization. And it's across the board in both the back office as well as the global manufacturing network and footprint. So it's a combination of both. There's no direct relationship to the sales performance in Europe in that higher number.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Adam Josephson from KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A large competitor of Diversey said it picked up new business in the last quarter. And has Diversey lost business since the acquisition? And can you just give us a little more details about the timing shift in North America that you spoke about earlier, Bill?","William V. Hickey","Yes, sure. Let me give you in terms of -- I actually have a list here, business wins and losses over the last 2 quarters. And without talking about specific competitors and who did what to whom, on net average, there's probably about 24 accounts that have changed. Our analysis shows we are net ahead by about $3 million.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the timing shift?","William V. Hickey","Timing shift in Q1 is 2 items. Principally 2 items is, there was one of our customers that we have subsequently learned that stocked up their inventory at the end of December to qualify for a higher rebate level. And so their first quarter orders were basically off because they were working off their inventory. And the second one was a change in one of our retail customer's purchasing pattern for their floor care.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And just one other one, what challenges, if any, have you encountered as part of the process of extracting these cost savings? Has the process adversely affected Diversey's relationships in any way?","William V. Hickey","We have not really affected any front-line customer-facing people. The most -- substantially all of the synergies are in-house. They're internal back office overhead categories that are not -- the number of -- the 6,500 customer-facing people all remain on the job. And at some point, we'll probably add to that.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Chris Manuel from Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions actually from comments earlier that you had through prepared comments and such. The first, if I could, I'm just going to run through a couple of numbers in Diversey and kind of ask for some help with something. But when I look at -- you had $21 million of -- was the adjusted profit for last year, $8 million this year. So if I start at the $21 million and I add the $15 million of synergies and then deduct off what you've identified here from volume and unfavorable mix, there still is about a $13 million GAAP year-over-year. And I think early you addressed that the volume issue was related to some timing or was embedded in there. And you've also, I thought, indicated that price cost was roughly a -- you would achieve what you needed in price cost although there's still a little more to come. So I guess what I'm missing or my question is, is there another piece that we're missing in the analysis that was a year-over-year incremental?","William V. Hickey","Yes. Well, okay, let me say 2 things is that: one is, I'll let Tod talk more detail on one of them is that the synergies are not all in all in Diversey because as we combined businesses -- it's interesting, when you have 2 HR departments and you end up picking the team that goes together as 1 HR department, if the headcount reduction comes on the Sealed Air side, that synergy is falling in the Sealed Air number. Whether that's the right way to do it or not, you can discuss it. But if we have 8 less people on Sealed Air HR because the Diversey has got particular strength at HR that we're letting them be the survivor in that particular part of the company, that synergy number is going to fall inside the Sealed Air number. So Tod can go into more detail on that. But on the difference, what you really got is that it's the volume and the mix component. I mean, it's basically at the margin line. It's at the gross margin line primarily on the volume shortfall. If the volume held up, we would have beat those numbers by quite a bit.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's something then that's above and beyond the $16 million you've called out?","Tod S. Christie","Yes.","William V. Hickey","Yes. Tod, on that?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, I'm not sure, Bill left me much room to expand. But, yes, the $15 million that we recorded in synergies in the first quarter, while we said that it was largely Diversey, there were synergy benefits in other segments as well. And as Bill said, it's partly where the affected employees are, if it relates to severance or where the plants are that relates to manufacturing operations and then we have back office where it's an allocated amount. So it's -- we've done our best to separate that by segment and the majority is in Diversey, but not all of it.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I'll follow up too on the low fine [ph]. And the second comment, Bill, and I may have misheard you, but there was a piece when you were talking about I thought some of your core Sealed Air business, your legacy business, where you're talked about rebuilding credibility with customers in the marketplace in regards to bringing your unique technologies and solutions to the market. Can you expand upon that a little bit, or what you were referring to there?","William V. Hickey","Well, I really wasn't referring to the core Sealed Air business. I was looking particularly at the North American Diversey business where over the last 4 years, Diversey's exited a lot of businesses in North America. And so we really need to rebuild our base with those customers that we are here to stay.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you comment on what your resin inflation was in the legacy Sealed Air business there in the quarter and what your outlook is for specialty resin and commodity resin inflation for the balance of 2012.","William V. Hickey","I think in the quarter is about 4% to 6%, in the quarter, Tod, right?","Tod S. Christie","Yes. And, yes, the outlook for the year, it's going to sound like a similar story because our outlook for the overall year is about 3% to 5% inflation, similar to what we're seeing on the chemical side.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So 3% to 5%, that's a percentage number?","Tod S. Christie","That's a percentage number, and our outlook kind of, as far as pacing, has not changed over the past 90 days either. So we expect some flattening over the course of the middle of the year, and then a further rise later in the year.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then so price cost in the legacy Sealed Air business, how did that trend during the first quarter?","William V. Hickey","Sealed Air price in the quarter was a $15 million positive.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then based on information you have now, realizing there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty, do you still -- do you expect that W.R. Grace settles out in '12, or does it get pushed out to next year?","Tod S. Christie","Well we're hopeful that it settles this year but\u2026","William V. Hickey","We say that every year.","Tod S. Christie","But I said in my prepared remarks that's -- there are still appeals underway. So we don't yet have that certainty, so I just ask you to follow along with us.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Mark DeVille (sic) [Mark Wilde] from Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question first on a couple of cash items. I noticed that non-cash comp is up $30 million. Should we assume that kind of your cash component is down by 30 is the direct offset?","Tod S. Christie","Yes. Well, that $30 million, what that relates to is our U.S. profit-sharing that we have usually paid in cash, but at various different times in our history have paid in shares and in a combination of cash and shares. So we've elected to make those payments in shares rather than cash, which conserves cash and allows us to pay down our debt more quickly.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And so, Tod, is that part of your maintaining your free cash flow guidance, is that included in there?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, is it a component of that, yes.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the other kind of cash question I had is just the tax rate -- the core tax rate came down by about 3% from 30% down to 27%. So have you made any changes in your cash tax assumptions for this year? I think you were at sort of 115 to 135?","Tod S. Christie","That's right, yes. The cash tax assumptions for the year remain the same. The core tax rate reduction is a combination of some additional tax planning that we've been able to do as well as a favorable settlement on an open audit.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one other question, just in the legacy Sealed Air businesses and protective, I think you mentioned that kind of Europe and the Middle East were down 3%, but then you went on to say driven by volume declines in Southern Europe. I just wondered if you could quantify how far that Southern European business dropped from a volume standpoint?","William V. Hickey","Yes, I don't think we said the core -- I said the core protective business in America was up 9. European business was actually, on the protective side, at constant currency volume was -- volume in the core European protective business was down low single digits.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I'm just reading from the release here, it says you may have volumes decline 3% due to economic weakness in Southern Europe. So I just -- it seemed like from that, that Southern Europe would have been down more sharply. I was just trying to get a sense of that, Bill.","William V. Hickey","Yes. And then the Southern Europe, particularly, Southern Europe is being Spain, Italy, Greece.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just to make sure I understand the synergy, if you got $15 million in the first quarter, I want to make sure I'm really seeing this correctly, that's obviously annualizing the $60 million so is it fair to say you only see an incremental $10 million for this year on top of this?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, I think, well $50 million, I think you're looking at it the right way and that we expect the synergies' pacing to grow over the course of the year. So the biggest quarter should be the fourth quarter. So what's implied -- yes, what's implied in the guidance is that we'll get another $55 million over the balance of the year. And we're continuing to refine our programs, and I expect we'll have another update when we report our second quarter earnings.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And then just on -- as we try to ascertain the seasonality of Diversey, we did a little exercise. If you go back over like the last 7 years, they would tend to see about a $40 million jump in EBIT from first to second quarter, hold there in the third, and then drop most of the way back down in the fourth quarter. And if the incremental synergies are only about $5 million, and they may not even all be in that segment, if I sort play with the numbers, it would seem like the EBIT for the year in Diversey, adjusted that is, would be something under, say, 145. Is that in the ballpark of what you incorporate into your 150 to 160? EPS?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, I'm not sure I followed all of the math, but I -- we kind of take it into pieces. The -- I think you've appropriately identified the seasonality of the EBIT with the second and third quarters being the strongest. Yes, maybe we can just come back to that one because I'm not sure I followed all the pieces there.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Well, we're starting with 8 in the first quarter and then so you'd go 48, 48 then back down to about 13. If you just used a rigid and then add a little bit for synergies, that's how I got there.","Tod S. Christie","Yes, I'm not sure I can comment on it.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then last, real quickly, capital spending for the year?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, we're still maintaining the same guidance. As you probably saw, we only spent $29 million in the first quarter. Capital spending can be lumpier than some of the other operating costs. So with the network optimization projects that we are planning as part of our overall optimization plan, as well as normal capital spending at this stage we're making and the guidance that we issued 3 months ago.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Which is about, what, 185-ish?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, 180 to 190 including $20 million for the network optimization project.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","I am with Gabelli & Company. Bill, you mentioned the rebates on the Diversey side, if I remember properly. Is that something that can change, or is the rebate a necessary evil to do business with some customers?","William V. Hickey","Yes -- no, Rosemarie. It's pretty common. Actually, it's on the Protective side, as well as on the Diversey side, we sell to the same channel on distribution. It's a practice, Rosemarie, that came into effect -- it's probably got to be 20 years ago, and it's been an incentive to get higher volumes. And they're basically low single-digit percents. And it's generally based on a certain volume growth over the prior year, and it's not unusual if a distributor gets close that if they can make the next tier by the end of the year, they will and it's not the first time I've seen it.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And on the equipment side, how strong was that particular part of the business, is backlog growing because that is really a sign of the strength of the business to come, if you could help a little bit on that?","William V. Hickey","Yes. Tod's has got some update on that.","Tod S. Christie","Yes, I think the -- I think we've talked about portions of the business where we had strong equipment sales during the quarter. Where we did see some weakness was in the Food business is basically against tough comps last year, and we do have a strong pipeline on food. So I expect it to be flat for the year. The protective business was up 20%, which is really a good sign for prospects for growth going forward.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Okay. And if I may ask one last question, could you talk about the trend during the quarter on a monthly basis, what are you seeing and if you could touch on your different businesses? If you could touch as to what you're seeing in April? And do you expect in those -- in your guidance, do you expect Europe to decline further in the second half of the year, I mean, the news are not that rosy there.","William V. Hickey","Yes. Well, I wish I had a crystal ball on Europe, Rosemarie, and I don't. I thought -- I mean, this is the fifth or sixth time the Europeans have come to an agreement on settling the crisis only for it to happen again a week or 2 later. But I'd give you a couple of things, and they're not completely obvious is that Diversey had a slower January, February but a strong March. And I think that, that's positive because the organization is coming together. It's been through a challenging transition over the last 4 or 5 months, and they come back strong in March. I think it was positive after a slower January, February. In the Sealed Air, the Protective side, it was a little bit the other way around. We had pretty good January, February. The first 3 weeks in March were reasonably slow, picked up the fourth week in March quite strong. We had one of our best-selling days of the quarter at the last week of March. On the food side, we did have that hiccup with the finely textured beef, which referred to in the media by another name.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Yes, pink slime.","William V. Hickey","And that was a negative for a little short period of time. It didn't last too long, but again, it basically came out of the line. I don't think it's going to come back. I don't think that was a timing issue. I think people for a period of a week or 2 just cut their beef consumption. So our comment from our food folks are those sales are probably lost. That's not going to be a timing issue. And we did have one unfortunate incident or 2 really from that finely textured beef is, one, we had a bankruptcy just under $1 million, about $800,000 from a customer who went Chapter 11 as a result of demand for finely textured beef dropping off, and a different customer on the Diversey side who did the cleaning and sanitation for one of the manufacturers of finely textured beef actually shut down their production. And we lost those sales in Q1, as I've mentioned on prepared comments. We probably won't see that factory start up for the rest of the year. So I'd say no real clear signal in the Industrial business, my own feeling has inventory correction in our customers in the first 3 weeks of March, and Diversey business coming back in the end of March was good.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Al Kabili from Credit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Bill or Tod, just on the outlook. I think you mentioned in the first quarter was on a pro forma basis sort of flattish. We know you have another, call it, close to $50 million of additional synergies sort still ramping. But the $1.2 billion of EBITDA for the full year, that probably implies about $180 million of EBITDA growth in the next 3 quarters. You're kind of flat, at first quarter, and you've got $60 million of synergies. So where -- help us with where the trends sound like they're similar to the first quarter in April. Where does the extra sort of growth come from at the remainder of the year?","William V. Hickey","Well, I think we were looking at 3% to 5% growth. And if you look at our growth in the quarter, total company was kind of less than that. It was 2 percentage. Then we've got the -- as you said, you've got the cost savings, which are going up. You've got the higher sales volume and the better mix. So you've got price, and remember, we've got $20 million price in the Sealed Air side and $20 million price on the -- total price in the quarter was about $42 million on a pro forma basis for the company. So you'll see that flow through higher volume and better mix plus the synergy number.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then 2 quickies on the -- 2 quick follow ups on that. One is, can you help us quantify what the financial impact was on Diversey for the timing of the North America order patterns, shifting and how much EBIT, EBITDA that sort of shifted 1Q to 2Q? And then are you -- is price cost going to be a positive in the second quarter? I know resin has -- that we've seen some, particularly in Europe, some cost inflation on the resin front. So as you look at 2Q, is that a tailwind price cost, a headwind, flat, help us with that.","William V. Hickey","Yes, price cost -- I'd say we're going into Q2 carrying some positive price. And we've indicated we have some price increases going into effect. If we execute those price increases well in Q2, we should be pretty neutral. If they drag out a little bit, we could be slightly unfavorable for the quarter, but we'd catch up early Q3.","Tod S. Christie","Yes. And, Al, on the effect in the quarter on the first item, it's less than $5 million in sales.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Tod Wenning from MorningStar.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","It looks like red meat slaughter rates are down sadly year-over-year. Have you had any problems managing that? And do you expect any reversal in the slaughter rates going into the back half of the year?","William V. Hickey","Yes. Meats are down low-single digits, 2% range, for year-over-year. And I think when you look at our food volumes being positive, I think that suggests that we're managed it well with providing customers alternatives, giving them more opportunities to merchandise better and really selling more product to customers on a smaller beef herd, and we've had some benefit because hogs are up, too. Pigs are up, and that helps offset some of the beef. But beef is -- we expect it to be down for the full year. You won't see probably cattle numbers turn positive 'till 2013 at the earliest.","Todd Wenning - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And are you seeing some -- sourcing some elongated reordering periods in Diversey's Europe government and education sector? And do you expect that to remain the same for the rest of the year?","William V. Hickey","I think pretty much so. Right, yes.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Gil Alexandre from Darphil Associates.","Gilbert Alexandre","I forget on the Grace settlement, how much free cash would you get it at the end?","Tod S. Christie","So it will depend on the value of the shares, as well as the amount of the cash that we pay when we ultimately fund the settlement. So the simple way to think about it is take the sum of those 2 and apply the U.S. tax rate to that. So if it's roughly $1.2 billion in value, and you apply 35% to that, you get something on the order of $400 million. And then that does not all come at once. So I think we've said in the past that we expect the majority of that to come in the year following the year in which we fund the settlement and then the balance will come in over a several-year period following that.","Gilbert Alexandre","And you'll probably get 80% of that year or the following year after the settlement?","Tod S. Christie","I think, yes, I think that's consistent with what we've said before.","Gilbert Alexandre","And on your free cash flows, that's before capital expenditures and dividends, isn't it?","Tod S. Christie","It is before dividends but after...","William V. Hickey","But after -- it's after CapEx before dividends and before debt service.","Gilbert Alexandre","After CapEx but before dividends.","William V. Hickey","It's after CapEx, yes.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Stewart Scharf from S&P Capital IQ.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","I was wondering if you could talk a little about the Latin America and how things are developing there, your growth prospects and just kind of break it down?","William V. Hickey","Latin America is a positive place in our business. If I look at a total company basis or -- see if I have here, our Latin American business is growing at, I don't know, I got to find the right number here -- 5.1%. The Diversey business in Latin America actually grew at 8%. Diversey Latin America grew at 8% in the first quarter. We're doing positive in most of the countries in Latin America. We've got our challenges in Argentina because of the economy and the regulatory environment. But basically, we looked at 8% growth in the Diversey business, 8% growth in the legacy Sealed Air business. The Brazilian meat industry is starting to recover. They had a slow period last year or so as the value of the currency made their beef exports less competitive, but we see them coming back online. So Latin America is kind of a bright spot for us if I look at business opportunities both on the Sealed Air and the Diversey side. Some of our earliest joint synergy sales are from the Latin American team, and they also think our first sale with our GE Water alliance was also generated in Latin America. So it's a real positive group, good attitude, and I think a lot of opportunity.","Stewart Scharf - S&P Equity Research","Okay. And then regarding price again, I just wasn't clear on -- you have price initiatives from '11 that are going to kick in this year and there also will be some additional price hikes within the year?","William V. Hickey","Yes. Stew, I think what I said is that we had $20 million of positive price on the Diversey side. We had a little over $20 million positive price on the Sealed Air side. The combined business generated about $42 million in positive price in the first quarter. That represented a follow over of price increases announced and implemented in the fourth quarter of '11, and that flowed to '12, as well as the partial effect that price increases implemented in '12 that were realized in Q1. ","Okay, I've got one more telephone question, then I'll take those couple there from the webcast. So if we could take that one more question from the phone?","Operator","Yes, it's from the line of Scott Gaffner from Barclays Capital.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on the increase in the working capital in the quarter. How much of that was driven by the new European principal company structure? And how much of that was just operating in the business? And if it is related to the principal structure, when should we see that come back?","Tod S. Christie","Yes, so it was -- that's solely within inventory, first of all. And the buildup, as a result of the European principal company structure, we should see reverse in the second quarter. And likewise, the seasonal build up should largely reverse in the second quarter as well. I would say that the majority of it was normal seasonal build up.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on the cash, I think you had $500 -- what was it, close to $530 million in cash currently.","Tod S. Christie","Yes.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","On the balance sheet, I mean, if the Grace settlement was to come in, are you concerned at all that you have a little bit lower cash balance at this point in time to fund the settlement?","Tod S. Christie","No. I mean, that's a seasonal variation. We have a $1.3 billion of cash and committed liquidity. So we do have access to other funds. We don't have to get any external financing if we were to fund Grace in the near term. And likewise, most of that cash is accessible to us. So there's very little traffic cash on our balance sheet.","William V. Hickey","Okay, operator, I'm going to take a couple of questions here that came in from the webcast. First question was an update on CFO search. ","We're still ongoing. We're in the sort of final rounds and the senior management team has been interviewing the last rounds of candidates, so it's in process. ","Second question, Diversey constant dollar sales Q1 by region. ","I'll give you constant dollar sales by region. If I look at the EMEA region and MIA, our constant dollar sales were up 1.2%. If I look at North America, it was actually a minus 5.7% -- EMEA was 1.6%, I'm sorry. I read the number wrong, 1.6%. North America was minus 5.7%, Latin America was plus 8%, Asia-Pacific was 6.4% and total Diversey quarter sales in constant dollars were 0.5% positive. ","Okay. Question -- then the next question from the webcast, second quarter constant dollar sales? 3% seems to be an acceleration versus Q1.","That's absolutely right. And it's basically seasonality as business picks up and as people prepare for the summer and you've got the lapsing of the onetime customer pattern from Q1, and you've also got the Hotel business and food and beverage picking up in Q2 as people begin traveling more and consuming more. And we also get better comps from Japan. I mean, we didn't point it out in our prepared comments, Japan represents about 10% of the Diversey business, about a $300 million business. And they were negative 10-plus percent as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in March of 2011. And as that business has come back, and we go into Q2, there will be favorable comps compared -- in Japan compared to prior year.","Okay. The next question, Diversey market share trends by geography and market?","We really don't talk market share. That's not our style and not the way we've typically done things, but overall, we continue -- we feel to not see any significant shift in our business in any particular region or any particular market. ","Okay, next question is, which business will require more price increases in Q2? And will it be in the 3% to 5% range? ","The business that probably will need some price in Q2 could very well be the Protective business, which is the largest buyer of the commodity resins. And to the extent that the commodity resins tend to be the most volatile in price, it's probably the Protective business. And I know the Protective management team is well aware and is prepared to move. And they will be in the 3% to 5% range. ","With that, I think we're definitely a little bit over time, but I want to thank you all for participating in the call. I would like to really reemphasize the strengths of the fundamentals of the business, that our short-term achievements in increasing and accelerating the cost synergies from the new organization, and the team is doing a fantastic job of meeting the needs of our expanding customer base. We're in a solid position to recognize the benefits of our efforts, most notably in the second half of the year. And we really have the organization positioned to confidently reach our targets even if we have to navigate through ongoing challenges in the European business. I think you'll see ongoing improvement in our results, stronger cash flows and further reduction in our debt levels, all of which will enhance our earnings. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to us today. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your call for today. Thank you for joining.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website, at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call, stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled, Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP.

Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone. As you can see from our results, free cash flow and earnings per share performance were the highlights for the quarter and the year. We generated $631 million in free cash flow in 2016, and this was net of $276 million in CapEx and $66 million in restructuring. The significant upside relative to our guidance was primarily driven by our continuous strong focus on working capital. We also delivered $0.76 in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter and $2.66 per share in 2016 after repurchasing only 5 million shares in the first nine months of the year.","In the fourth quarter, both Food Care and Diversey Care delivered organic sales growth of approximately 3% and adjusted EPS growth of 16%. In Food Care, protein packaging volumes in North America increased more than 6%. Our hygiene business increased by 5% in constant dollars and we delivered favorable price mix on a global basis. Diversey Care's growth was primarily driven by favorable price mix of over 2% and volume increases of 7% and 3% in Asia-Pacific and North America, respectively. Where we felt short in the quarter was our top-line constant dollar growth in Product Care, which weighed on our adjusted EBITDA performance.","We knew December would be a critical month for us with most of our global growth depending on our e-Commerce business, and we were happy with our e-Commerce volume growth of 15% in the quarter, but this was offset by weakness in global industrial GDP and our product rationalization efforts. And despite the shortfall in sales, adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points over the last year to 22.3%.","So as I'm sure you all know, I am not happy with our overall organic growth of 1.3% in 2016. We underestimated the impact of the economic and geopolitical environment in Latin America and the Middle East, the depth of the downcycle in the Australian beef market and the weakness in the industrial world. But at the same time, I'm very pleased with the agility of our organization, its ability to deliver bottom line results and properly prioritize. I'm also extremely pleased with the innovation pipelines and the number of new disruptive products that we are gradually introducing and launching across the three divisions.","Our total net sales outlook for 2017 of 2.5% constant dollar growth reflects approximately 3% of growth for Food Care and Product Care, and 1% for Diversey Care, which accounts for the short-term impact of the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson. Internally, the actions that we're taking to drive growth in 2017 are purposeful. We will leverage our strong global presence in Food Care and continue growing at a faster pace than the protein packaging markets. We will capitalize on the e-Commerce opportunity with our disruptive technologies. And the underlying constant dollar sales growth for Diversey Care, excluding SCJ, is expected to be at an all-time high in 2017 and our plans to rebuild our consumer brands business is very well underway.","We recognize that 2017 will prove to be a critical year for Sealed Air, particularly, as we proceed with our plans for the separation of New Diversey. As you know, we disclosed back in October that we are pursuing a tax-free spin-off. And today, we announced that we are also exploring all the strategic alternatives including the potential sale of New Diversey, and we're confident that the separation is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation, and will enable us to unlock meaningful value for customers and shareholders. At this point, we are very limited on what we can share about the separation process, and thank you in advance for respecting our need to significantly limit our comments.","So now let me turn back on the full quarter and year-end performance. On slide 5 and 6 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the fourth quarter and the full year. In Q4, organic sales growth was 2% with positive trends across all regions. Organic growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. And in EMEA, positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care were partially offset by declines in Product Care. And performance in Asia was very strong in Diversey Care at 7% constant dollar growth, but the total company's results were impacted by a 10% decline in Australia due to the beef market downcycle. Australia accounted for approximately 7% of Food Care net sales in the fourth quarter. And for the full year 2016, net sales increased 1.3% as compared to 2015 on an organic basis. Constant dollar growth in Latin America was 9% and organic growth in EMEA was 2%. North America and Asia Pacific were essentially unchanged as compared to last year.","Turning to slide 7, which highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. You can see that from this slide that on a global basis, volume trends were flat to up 2% throughout the year. Let me highlight that our volume in North America has accelerated throughout the year, with 4.2% growth in the fourth quarter on the heel of 3.8% in the third quarter. We delivered favorable price mix in each quarter throughout 2016 as a result of positive trends in Food Care and Diversey Care.","Now, let me to turn to slight 8 and review Food Care results. Positive volume trends in North America and EMEA, favorable price mix, and disciplined cost management were key contributors to our fourth quarter organic sales growth of 3%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21%, an increase of 250 basis points over last year. We're seeing the benefit of higher beef volume and market share gains through the continued global adoption of our new products. Similar to the third quarter, these positive trends were offset by volume declines in Australia and Latin America.","For the full year 2016, Food Care delivered $3.2 billion in net sales or 2% organic sales growth. Packaging solutions were $2.6 billion, and hygiene solutions were $600 million. In adjusted EBITDA, Food Care reported $661 million or 20.5% of net sales. Packaging solutions delivered adjusted EBITDA of $593 million or 22.7% of net sales and hygiene delivered the remaining $68 million of EBITDA or 11.3% of net sales. I'd like to highlight that the hygiene business has improved its margins by over 400 basis points on an as-reported basis since 2013 and has a very bright future as part of New Diversey by providing market-leading solutions and technology advancements enhanced by acquisitions of Dry Lube and Ciptec.","For the full 2017, Food Care sales are forecasted to increase approximately 3% in constant dollars. Our core business is expected to continue growing faster than the market with more contribution from our Change the Game initiatives, particularly OptiDure and Darfresh. Latin America is starting to stabilize and Australia will continue to be impacted by declines in the beef market, also to a lesser degree as compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales and similar to 2016, we expect the Q1 to be our low point for sales and EBITDA.","Turning to Diversey Care's results on slide 9, you can see that net sales were up 3% in constant dollars in the fourth quarter and up 2% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 13% increased 180 basis points in the quarter and for the full year, margins increased 120 basis points to 12.8%. Sales growth in the quarter and throughout the year was driven by increased sales from existing and new customers in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant sales growth. And in Asia-Pacific, growth was led by strength in China, India and Southeast Asia. Towards the Middle East and parts of Europe, the hospitality sectors struggled in the second half, as a result of declines in tourism and occupancy rates, due to terrorist attacks.","In 2017, Diversey sales are expected to increase approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis, with adjusted EBITDA margins in line with 2016 results. And as I noted earlier, our plans are well underway to mitigate the impact of SCJ; and sales from the core business, excluding SCJ, is growing on an accelerated pace. This growth is a direct result of the investments that we have made in our product portfolio, go-to-market strategy and sales organization.","Slide 10 highlights the results from our Product Care division. In the fourth quarter and full year, Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were essentially unchanged as compared with 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points to 22.3% in the quarter and 90 basis points to 21.8% in 2016.","In the fourth quarter, Product Care delivered strong volume trends in North America, which were partially offset by declines in Europe. Adjusting for product rationalization, North America volumes were up approximately 5%, driven by strength in our e-Commerce segment. And similar to the third quarter, our performance in Europe was negatively impacted by the industrial environment. And in the latter half of 2016, we have been introducing an unprecedented number of new technologies and solutions, and as a result, we are experiencing significant interest from our customers, which mainly you saw firsthand at Pack Expo \u2013 many of you saw at Pack Expo in early November. Sales for these products including I-Pack, FloWrap, StealthWrap, Inflatable, Bubble and also mailers are expected to ramp up in 2017 and contribute to both our top and bottom line growth.","We will continue to invest heavily in the business to support new product launches and global growth opportunities. But for our industrial based business, we are planning for sales to be relatively in line with 2016. And also keep in mind that our rationalization efforts are behind us, so that you will not see a true apples-to-apples constant dollar sales growth rate until the second half of 2017. For the full year 2017, we anticipate year-over-year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 3%, and similar to Food Care, adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase at a faster pace than sales.","And now, let me pass the call to Carol to review our net sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and more details on our outlook for 2017. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Jerome. Turning to slide 11, let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter and $6.8 billion for the full year 2016. Volume contributed $26 million and $15 million to top line growth in the quarter and for the full year, respectively. Favorable price mix was $9 million in Q4 and $41 million for the year. Unfavorable currency translation was $40 million in the quarter and $243 million in 2016. Food Care divestitures impacted sales by $5 million in Q4 and $102 million for the full year.","On slide 12, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion or 17.1% for the full year. Mix and price\/cost spread was $13 million favorable in Q4 and $46 million in 2016. Volume growth contributed $9 million to the quarter, and $19 million for the year. Restructuring savings were $10 million and $43 million in Q4 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses increased $6 million in the quarter. For the full year, operating expenses increased $69 million, most of which is related to compensation inflation. Currency was a negative $4 million in Q4 and a negative $35 million in 2016. For the full year, divestitures had a negative impact of $21 million on adjusted EBITDA.","Adjusted gross margins improved 60 basis points in the fourth quarter and in the full year, resulting in 36.8% margin and 37.4% margin, respectively. We were pleased with this performance in light of the volatility of input cost and timing of raw material cost pass through in Food Care. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.66 for the full year. Currency translation reduced EPS by $0.01 in the quarter and by $0.11 for the full year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18% and for the full year 21.6%. We repurchased 4.7 million shares for approximately $217 million in 2016. We still have approximately $667 million available under the board approved share repurchase plan, and expect to return to share buybacks, following the New Diversey separation.","Turning to slide 13, free cash flow was a source of cash of $631 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of cash of $151 million. CapEx increased to $276 million, which includes $100 million related to the investment in our Charlotte campus and $30 million related to other CapEx restructuring activity. CapEx in 2015 was $184 million. As Jerome commented, the strong free cash flow performance was driven by optimization of our working capital, including the implementation of our new supply chain financing program, our procurement team and our credit and collections team exceeded their targets for the fourth quarter, generating more than $80 million improvement above our prior guidance for free cash flow.","Now, turning to outlook on slide 14, in constant dollars, net sales are expected to increase approximately 2.5% for the full year 2017. This forecast assumes approximately 1% constant dollar growth for Diversey Care and approximately 3% growth for both Food Care and Product Care. While both volume and price mix are expected to be contributors to 2017 growth, we expect more growth to come from accelerated volume trends throughout the year. We estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately $220 million or 3%. Our major currency exposures in 2016 included: the euro, which was approximately 18% of net sales; the British pound, which was 5%; Australian dollar was 4%; and the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar were each approximately 3% of net sales.","2017 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $1.18 billion. Please note that contrary to last year, interest income of $10 million is excluded from our EBITDA guidance. Unfavorable currency translation is estimated to be approximately $40 million. As a reminder, a 5% swing in the euro has an impact of approximately $10 million on adjusted EBITDA. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2017. Our net interest expense for 2017 is estimated at $215 million.","Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.70, assuming unfavorable currency translation of $0.14. We expect our adjusted tax rate to increase to approximately 23%, which will negatively impact year-over-year EPS by $0.05. Our forecast for EPS is based on a weighted average 197 million diluted shares. We are forecasting free cash flow to be approximately $600 million in 2017. We expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash, as we continue to progress on inventory management and our supply chain financing program.","Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be approximately $85 million to $100 million, depending on the pace of addressing stranded costs. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million in 2017, with additional savings in 2018. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million. Cash tax payments are estimated to increase to a $175 million. And CapEx is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately a $185 million. Our outlook for free cash flow in 2017 does not include any material fees associated with the separation efforts of New Diversey. The cost associated with the separation is expected to be managed with an existing program and funds generated as a result of the separation.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our first quarter 2017 earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, April 27.","With that, operator, can you please open up the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question is from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Your line is open.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning, Ghansham.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning, Ghansham.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, I guess, kind of looking back at 2016 and core sales growth, it was almost 50-50 divided between price mix and volume, is that the right way to think about 2017 as it relates to Food Care and Product Care growth at 3%, and off the (24:22) volume bucket for Food Care and Product Care, those two businesses, how much do you think will come from new products, OptiDure, Darfresh on Tray and all the many new products, Jerome, that introduced in Product Care late last year? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, good question. And no, I don't think that is going to be \u2013 the growth is going to be 50-50. I think that the growth is going to \u2013 actually the way we're seeing the growth is definitely more towards volume growth than price mix. That's mainly how we see it happen. We are dealing with the resin price which is flattish, it's coming up in the first quarter and so \u2013 but we believe that those are going to come down during the year. So, it really is volume growth that we're looking at.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from George Staphos of Bank of America. Your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Appreciate all the details. I guess if you could go back to the prior quarter and what your internal views might have been for 2017, and as we then fast forward to the current time, Jerome, what if anything has changed the most for you either positively or negatively in terms of the outlook for 2017, recognizing volume is going to be, in your view, an important contributor to top line growth, are there any other elements to your strategy that you might be working a little bit more aggressively this year, given that you said that you weren't entirely happy with the performance in 2016, as well. Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. Thanks, George. Good question again. And no, I am not happy. I am not happy with the growth that we had, and I am disappointed. Why? Because we didn't have a very strong \u2013 we didn't have much growth in the first half, a little bit in the third quarter, it's improving somewhat in the fourth quarter, but it is not at the levels that I was expecting, and yes, indeed we have been surprised by a few things. Number one is the global GDP, you go to Bloomberg on February 2016 and you see that global GDP was forecasted at 2.4%, and it ended up \u2013 global ended up at 1.9% with the U.S. at 2.4% also, which ended up also at 1.9%, and Europe, which was forecasted at 1.9% and it is at 1.6%.","And for 2017, the trend seems to be the same. Last year 2017 was seen to have a global GDP forecast, for 2017, a year ago, at 2.6%, and today's projection is 2.3%. So, we can't ignore those kind of things and what has disappointed me is the lack of industrial GDP growth. In a world economy, which had 1.9% global GDP growth, this is probably one of the worst years that we have experienced in many years actually. And it's always next year which is supposed to be better, but you know what? We're not counting on it. And in our forecast at this point in time, we are considering that the industrial world is not going to be better, and if it comes as a good surprise, well be it, we'd love that.","Back in June of 2015, during Analyst Day, almost two years ago now, or 18 months ago, we were seeing a macro world which was going to be better. The reality is that in 2016, LatAm has been much worse than we thought it was going to be. And again, industrial market has been much softer. So that's how we plan.","What am I happy with? Very frankly, we have invested a lot of money in new products and in R&D and marketing, to position new products. At Pack Expo late October, we have shown and we have announced quite a few innovations, which are disruptive and are going to make an impact. But what you had seen at that time, for several of those equipments, our products which \u2013 it was the first production, so we launched at that time and now in 2017 we have to ramp up those things. The thing that we all need to understand is that we're doing very different things that we were doing a few years ago.","A few years ago, we were launching just simple products. Today, we're launching solutions, we're launching equipment, razor\/razor blade, those are higher margin products, but the issue of this is that it takes a little bit of \u2013 the sales cycle is a little bit longer. When you work with meat processors and retail chains, in Europe, in North America, to establish Darfresh on Tray are those kinds of extraordinary solutions, which have a very, very clear mega trend, it just takes time, and we have talked about that. We have talked that with some of those retailers, the cycle between the first time we talk about that \u2013 about such a product or a solution and the production or the goal that's produced after ordering the equipment, this is two years.","And it's the same on Product Care. One thing was to sell a little inflatable machine, and another thing is to do operational excellence with our e-commerce partners and improve all the organization and show them how much value they can create out of StealthWrap, FloWrap and I-Pack, and those kind of things. So I'm disappointed with the overall world economy support. I'm extraordinarily excited, which is why during the year 2016, we have invested so much money in R&D and in marketing to position those new solutions, because I really believe that this is disruptive, and our expected growth is probably delayed just \u2013 has probably been delayed by a few quarters, but I'll conclude, because this is very key, that we've seen an acceleration of the volume growth in Sealed Air in the fourth quarter.","We had the highest volume growth in Food Care of each \u2013 of all the quarters in 20 \u2013 in the fourth quarter, same for Diversey. And almost the same, we had a very strong third quarter in Product Care, but same \u2013 almost the same in Product Care.","So it's absolutely not doom and gloom, but we have to be realistic, and 2017 is going to be mostly about volume. And talking about Diversey, let me remind you what I said earlier, it is going to be our fastest growth business, fastest growth year, if you exclude the short-term impact of the SCJ.","And we told you why this agreement did not get renewed is that it was not fitting either company. We wanted access to wider markets, to consumer markets, to all kind of, do-it-yourself type of market, and SCJ didn't want that.","And therefore, we agreed to disagree. Yes, it does have a short-term impact, but this was really the right thing to do for the company. We have lots of great plans in place, and you're going to see outside of this SCJ business, we're going to have the highest growth that we ever had in Diversey here.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Jerome. Good morning, Carol.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning, Scott.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just looking back at the presentation from late last year, when you talked about the spin transaction for the Diversey business. And obviously, it was a tax-free spin, and you mentioned in the release, you are including possibly doing a potential sale. I mean, are you okay, potentially realizing the lower proceeds simply due to tax leakage for the business now, just because it does maybe get you to your goal of simplifying the operating structure, or how should we think about that?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Well, the way you should think about this is that we're going to be counting properly and that we're going to do what is the best for our shareholders. And, I'm not announcing a sale, well, I am saying that we are pursuing to do it right here.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Yes. The next question is from Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Just one quick question on resin cost. I mean what are your expectations for 2017? I mean, they seem to be staying higher than expected and the case would not be, what oil prices do, or whether we'll see a decline in the second half of the year. So, how you combat in those rise in resin costs?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So the market is choppy, you've seen that, that there's been increases in September, which were given back two months later. You see that the $0.05 in February is going through. We'll have to see whether the $0.06 (34:56) is going through, you'll have ethylene prices which are high, you have turnarounds, which are fabulously orchestrated. And at the very same time, you'll have some high capacity, or lots of capacity which is coming later in the year.","So our view on the full year is that our \u2013 that prices are going to be flattish, and formula prices have a little bit of lag, is this going to impact the first half? A little bit with those price increases announced, yes, but for the whole year, we are counting on flat sales, which is why, by the way, we are not going to \u2013 we are not having a lot of price in our growth forecast, we have price mix, but we don't have very much of that. What you have to know is that we're very diligent. We have announced the pricing increase effective March 1 in our Product Care business, we're looking at systematic price product line by line, it's not going to apply across the board, because it's going to apply to polyethylene based products and we don't have only polyethylene based products in Product Care. We're looking at similar things where we don't have formulas in other \u2013 in other divisions, and by definition, we're not in the business of absorbing those cost increases.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Next question is from Adam Josephson of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just one on the SC Johnson agreement. Can you just talk about what the adverse impact on Diversey's EBITDA is from termination of that relationship, and how the new Diversey pro forma EBITDA now compares to the $305 million that you laid out, when you announced the spin? Thank you.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So, well, we have never given and we're not going to be giving the specific detail on this contract, but I have \u2013 I have said that we are expecting 1% sales growth and flattish EBITDA in 2017 out of Diversey Care as a result of this. Given that we are having under non-Diversey Care \u2013 non-SC Johnson business we're having higher growth than what we had in total in 2017 \u2013 in 2016.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to clarify a couple things on the 2017 outlook. Carol, first I think I heard you mention it was probably a $10 million basis adjustment in the way that you're calculating EBITDA for 2017, that's a negative on there. Then why not give a range on it, given some of the uncertainty out there? You know, historically, I think, you'd given maybe a $20 million range, is it kind of appropriate to think about it as a $10 million range around the point estimate? And then, just finally, on the first quarter, usually at least in 2016, you saw about a $40 million drop in EBITDA from 4Q to 1Q, are you thinking about a sort of a similar amount of seasonality this year? Thanks.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Brian. Yes, we highlighted that if you looked at it apples-to-apples and how interest expense \u2013 our interest income would be treated, the 1180 (38:32) would be $10 million higher, including interest income. So we've made that change in our guidance and we'll reflect that in our actual results as we move forward. If you want to have a number for comparison purposes, the interest income that was included in the adjusted EBITDA reported for 2016 is $13 million of positive interest income. And we'll reflect that change in Q1.","With respect to providing a range, we just felt that it was probably cleaner to pick a point of the $1.18 billion and work towards that, it helps with our modeling, as well as yours and our investors to do that, so that's what we've done. And then just we highlighted and called out the various moving pieces, and I think, one of the changes versus maybe what you were looking at before is definitely on the share count and the currency and SCJ, all three of those are causing a bit of headwind, if you look at probably street expectations versus the numbers that we've reported this morning as our outlook.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","So what you're having here is in 2017, we have included basically $50 million of negative, and it's $40 million from currency, and it is $10 million \u2013 actually it's more, it's $13 million on the interest income. So you have $53 million right there.","And then next to that, you'll have a very transparent explanation of a flat Diversey Care in terms of EBITDA for the simple reason in constant currency \u2013 flat EBITDA, for the simple reason that we have a temporary situation with these consumer goods contracts. And this compares to a double-digit EBITDA growth in constant currency every single year in the last four years in Diversey Care. So that's what's going on.","And should currency be better than the $40 million impact? We're going to be obviously happy about this. It is pretty choppy, remember, the euro was at $1.03 four weeks ago, three-and-a-half weeks, it is at $1.07, and those kind of things. You have quite a few movements of currency at this point in time. But you have $53 million of negatives right away as I just compared those two things on interest income, and currency.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","And Brian with respect to your question about Q1 2017, we did highlight in our comments that we do expect it to be the low point in terms of EBITDA earnings in 2017, and we will accelerate as we move throughout the year.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Tyler Langton of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you. Just had a question on the currencies, I don't know if I missed it, but could you just give some details on, I guess, what rates you are assuming in your guidance and then, I think Carol you mentioned the euro sensitivity, but could you give any sensitivity around your exposure to the other currencies? Thanks.","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes. So if we look at for 2017, we have assumed the euro at $1.05 and the great British pound at $1.25. Those would be two of the major currencies, and I called out the percentages in my comments that the euro represents about 18% of net sales and the British pound was 5%. The next highest currency that reflects \u2013 that impacts us is the Australian dollar at 4% of our net sales. And we're assuming a rate of $1.33 for 2017.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Yes. The next question is from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Just a quick clarification question, I assume the comment around looking at strategic alternatives, you just limited at Diversey rather than entire company, and I guess, separately, just given the growth you're seeing in 2017 from new products, the beef cycle turning and just being done with pruning on the industrial side, I would have thought mix would have contributed more in 2017? Can you just talk about how you think about mix the next few years? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","If you just give a little bit of more color to the question, specific question? Mix, what kind of mix are you referring to?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Referring to Change the Game, Jerome, in terms of price mix in 2017?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. So, we're not giving those kind of details of price mix for existing products or new product, et cetera. Generally speaking, what you have to consider is that our solution based offering is having higher margins because as we are creating, with some of our solutions, extraordinary value for our customers, we are in a mode of sharing those. And we have glowing examples of those and when you take products like OptiDure where you have less flickers at the production level, where you have more additional sales because of the shine of the product and tightness in the vacuum. When you have Darfresh on Tray, which reduces dramatically the shrink at the retailer level, and it improves the shelf life and therefore, the supply chain.","When you have products like FloWrap and StealthWrap, whose number one benefit are \u2013 and I-Pack, number one benefit are to reduce the shipping costs, because they generate less Cube, which is by the way in e-commerce, the number one cost. When you take the whole packaging operation, the number one cost is freight, is shipping cost. So when you can improve all of those kind of things, you are in a position to obviously enjoy better margins if you can demonstrate those value. So that's how we're going. But having said that, we're not giving details on the margins of existing products versus the new products, although during our Investor Day in September, we'll be able to give an update of how we're progressing and with our Change the Game offering.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Your line is open.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just a question on Product Care. A third of that business is e-commerce, third-party logistics that's presumably growing double digits. Can you help us square that with the 1.5% overall volume growth in the Q? And then maybe just following up on Phil's question, if I look at the three businesses for the year, Product Care had the best volume growth but the weakest price\/mix. Is that a case where some of the new sales gains in e-commerce are coming from lower margin products or any color you can give there will be helpful?","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes, you're correct that the volume growth in Product Care total year has been 1.4% in 2016 versus 1% in Food Care. It's not like this in the fourth quarter because it was Food Care, which had the highest growth. Having said that, the price\/mix has also been different, and the price\/mix has been more unfavorable every single quarter during 2016. And this is because we don't have price formula. So depending on the mix and also depending on the type of products or resin prices, we have to adapt our pricing in a very different way because those are very different businesses with our customers there.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Manuel of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Chris D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. I have just one question on Diversey, but there's a couple little pieces to it. First, the $250 million or so you did this year, remind us, because I forget, what the corporate allocation element is in there, so what should I think the real kind of EBITDA number is.","And then if I heard you correctly, earlier in the call you said that share repurchase would be sort of on hold until you made a decision or got some clarity there, whether it's a spin or sale. And I guess then the last piece is timing. Has anything changed from it being a third quarter event?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay, So, Chris, I'll start with respect to allocation. The costs that sit within the businesses that you see within our segment reporting, they primarily represent the cost to operate that business, and that's true for all three of the businesses. So I would not think about it having a huge amount or even a mid-sized amount of allocation that's not needed to support the business. We've made a decision all along that we keep a lot of the more corporate-type costs, they sit in that other category where we have corporate and the Other Medical and New Ventures small business. So what sits there within the segment is largely what it requires for that business to operate within Sealed Air. And then with respect to the separation itself, we've referenced the second half, and there is really not a lot more we can say on that separation. It's proceeding as Jerome has described.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Yes. The next question is from Jason Freuchtel of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Jason A. Freuchtel - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","In terms of your free cash flow guidance, I think total cash restructuring expectations over the course of 2016 and 2017 came down relative to what you previously indicated. Is the difference primarily being driven by the separation of Diversey Care and will restructuring payments go away in 2018? And then additionally for CapEx, is $185 million an appropriate level to assume going forward for just the Food Care and Product Care segments?","Carol P. Lowe - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. So, Jason, thank you. With respect to the restructuring, you're correct. The amounts are lower than what we had originally forecast even as late as Q3. And you're also correct that it is largely driven by the separation plans. I made the comment on our Q3 earnings call that we would manage initial cost within the existing program, as it related to starting to address some of the stranded costs, and that's what we've looked at.","We've also been very diligent about going through the programs and prioritizing based on what could give a near-term return and also recognizing that separation of a business of this size for New Diversey also takes commitment and focus. And we want to make sure we optimize value for the shareholder and we continue great service for our customers. So that's also caused prioritization, and it decreased the amount we spent in 2016 and shifting to 2017. In total, the amount for restructuring is not changing. We would expect to have some spend in 2018, but also savings in 2018 based on this shift. But we will be taking a hard look as we move throughout the first half at this program and what will add the most value for Sealed Air.","With respect to the CapEx, we'll provide more color on forecasted CapEx for Food Care and for Product Care post identification of the separation.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Good morning, Jerome. Good morning, Carol and Lori.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Just wanted to swing back to the Product Care business and can we get some sense of whether in general the e-commerce business right now has lower margins than the segment overall? And then also, I'm just kind of curious why volume isn't a little bit better given that we're seeing things like the ISM Index for manufacturing pickup, we're seeing some pickup in other forms of industrial packaging, so maybe your thoughts there.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. So what Product Care has clearly suffered from is from the mix between industrial and e-commerce and 3PL. Let me address the second part of your question first, which is the Index. Yes, in general speaking, we can see some ratios, which are hanging in there. The reality is that we have the bulk of our business, about 85% of our business, is in North America and is in Europe. And when you look at those two parts of the world and when you talk with our customers, and very frankly on the industrial part, their exports and their business is suffering, and it's just sluggish.","When you have the U.S. with a GDP of 1.9%, all driven by consumers, you can call this an industrial GDP boom or these kind of things. And as I said, the bulk of our Product Care business is in North America and in Europe. So that's the way it is.","Unfortunately, we have a large part of our Product Care business in there. Fortunately, we're growing very fast in the 3PL and e-commerce business, and the solutions that we have are absolutely second to none, disruptive, and revolutionary. Thus every time we are engaged with new customers, we are going through a whole process of new value being created and working on how we can go and get the kind of things done.","And now addressing your first question, which was related to the margins of e-commerce versus industrial. Yes, indeed with our current portfolio, they are slightly lower. But with the solutions that we have shown at Pack Expo, they are going to be definitely improving and not lagging our industrial business.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. The final question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to get back to the volume side. You seem somewhat confident in there, and maybe you can just discuss how that works out by region. North America and Europe have seen decent gains in both Food Care and Product Care, but the non-U.S. is still pretty concerning. How do you see that playing out next year? Do you see continued drags in Latin America and Australia, and then also in Europe in Product Care? Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","It seems that your question started with Food Care and so...","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. I just wanted to see if you can go through both if possible. Thanks.","Jerome A. Peribere - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure. So in Food Care, we're seeing continually strong growth out of North America. We had negative volume in Latin America, actually very negative in Brazil, positive in some other parts of Latin America, but for a total being negative. We believe that this is going to be stabilized. When we look at the herd and type of the cattle cycle, we are seeing that, specifically in Brazil, we're seeing that it has hit the trough in 2016. We believe that the first half of the year is going to be somewhat flattish, and that it is going to start to improve in the second half of 2017.","When you look at Australia, 2017 is going to be lower than 2016. Again, we are following very closely their herd size. The herd size is being rebuilt in 2017. It has dramatically come down in 2016 for all the reasons that we talked about. And when you think about the herds in 2014, it was 29 million head, and in 2016 it was about 26.2 million. And this has been a huge reduction and the slaughter rate has dramatically decreased.","We believe that it is going to continue in 2017 at lower a pace but it's going to continue, and definitely as the herd is being rebuilt from 2016 in 2017 and onwards, towards 2021, we believe that the business in Australia, the slaughter rate is going to increase, and as you know, it's a positive from 2018.","So what we see is that from 2018, we're going to have the three big parts of the world which are exporting, et cetera, which are Latin America, Australia, and North America be on an up cycle, and that's going to be definitely very positive of that.","To be noted also is that the exports out of Brazil are improving, but you have to remember that about 88% of the Brazilian beef exports are frozen and 12% are fresh. The good news is that fresh is expanding with the approval to export to the U.S. and will open to Asian markets as well.","So on Product Care, we think we have a huge momentum on 3PL and e-commerce. We're going to be showing more of the partnership agreements that we have in the second quarter with very important ones. And so we're doing great things. It is going great and we are going to be showing, we believe, nice growth in the 3PL, e-commerce in North America.","The European business has been negative in the fourth quarter. Disappointing, definitely led by our industrial business in Europe. The whole question is how do we mitigate with e-commerce and 3PL the flattish trends in industrial. And our view is that we shouldn't count on industrial increase in 2017, and preserve our position there at the very same time, continue to aggressively grow the businesses which have momentum and in which we're very disruptive.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, that ends our conference call for today. Thank you every one for joining.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Sue, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com. I'd like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and these reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. Please note that we will end the call by 9:30 today. Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. At this point, I'm sure you had the chance to carefully review our second quarter earnings release, and I must admit that I'm happy to see how we are assembling the product. Our financial performance in the quarter is yet another data point that gives us confidence that our strategy is working, an important data point, as this is our best adjusted quarter ever -- adjusted EBITDA quarter ever. We are improving the quality of earnings and continuously implementing new disciplines to expand margins and increase cash flow, but this strategy is not just about the financials. It is also about becoming a knowledge-based company. It is about changing the culture, changing our go-to-market strategy, and ultimately, delivering the most value-added and innovative solutions, which make our customers win. A significant step in making this happen is to create a stronger, one-company culture.","As I shared with you last week, we announced plans to relocate our global headquarters to a state-of-the-art, environmentally sustainable facility in Charlotte, North Carolina. We will be moving our 3 divisions, R&D facilities and our corporate offices into a single location, and within 3 years, we expect to have about 1,300 employees in our new global campus. This move should not be considered as an isolated initiative. It is part of our \"Change the Game\" puzzle that we continue to successfully assemble. We have resolutely focused on our pricing and working capital initiatives that I first discussed with you back in the first quarter of 2013. We expected to see results towards the end of the year, and we did. At our Analyst Day in September of last year, we talked about creating a one-company culture, and with that objective in mind, we presented our new vision, mission, values and our new modern logo, the Trillian. You would be surprised how this new culture is making inroads in the company. And the move to the new campus must be seen in that light, a determined goal to unite our culture across divisions and functions, to dramatically increase innovation, new business models and collaboration, gain efficiencies and actually accelerate change, all of these for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Let me now focus on our discussion on the second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, Carol and I will open for the -- up the call for your questions.","So on Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the second quarter. I will highlight sales trends on a constant dollar basis as compared to last year. Latin America and AMAT continue to be our fastest-growing regions, with growth of 8% and 7%, respectively. In Latin America, the 8% growth did not compensate for the currency devaluation, as our raw material costs are priced in U.S. dollar equivalent, and therefore, we're continuing our pricing efforts in the third and fourth quarter. Additionally, we lost 30% of our sales in Venezuela in second quarter, which should not be a surprise to many of you. In AMAT, China delivered 13% currency sales growth -- constant currency sales growth, with both Food Care and Product Care reporting double-digit growth due to strong demand for our new products and increased market penetration. Diversey Care also had very solid performance, with nearly double-digit growth as a result of our continued focus on food service and hospitality markets.","North America sales were up 3%, with favorable price\/mix in each of our 3 divisions. And in Europe, we delivered a slight increase in sales. France reported a 2.5% growth. Spain was up slightly and the U.K. and Holland were essentially unchanged. But this was offset by declines in Italy, Germany and Switzerland, and bear in mind that these 7 countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 22% of second quarter sales. Russia and Poland delivered strong performance, with 15% and 8% constant currency growth, respectively. Sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand increased 2%, led by a 3% increase in Australia, partially offset by a 4% decline in New Zealand, and this decline was due to our decision to exit the low-margin business in the Food Care division.","On Slide 5, we outline our price\/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we had constant currency sales growth in every division and in every region. We have made significant progress with our pricing initiatives and new disciplines across our division, with a 4.6% positive price\/mix in Food Care, 1.9% in Diversey Care and 3% in Product Care. On a regional basis, we had favorable price\/mix in all regions except Europe, where unfavorable mix offset a positive price due to the subdued economy throughout the volume -- throughout Western Europe.","Turning to Slide 6, and moving to Food Care. Sales increased 4% in constant dollars, with approximately 3% growth in packaging and 6% growth in hygiene. We had 10% growth in the developing regions. Latin America and AMAT continued to be our fastest-growing regions, with strong demand for our innovative products and solutions. Japan, Australia and New Zealand sales were up approximately 2%, with almost 5% growth in Australia, offset by what I already talked about, which was the 3% decline in New Zealand.","In North America, cattle and hog slaughter rates were down approximately 5% each in the second quarter. We have seen signs of herd rebuilding in cattle due to declining feedstocks and favorable pastures. We anticipate beef production to continue declining into the second half of the year. Third quarter could potentially be the trough of the cycle, as evidenced with very recent publications of the July slaughter rates in the U.S. Keep in mind, this trend is positive for the beef cycle over the long term, and hog slaughters is also anticipated to continue declining in the coming months, with some industry experts suggesting that it will subside in the fourth quarter. Despite these unfavorable market trends in North America, we were able to outperform the market, and deliver just over 2% constant currency sales growth, with favorable price\/mix, better pricing and new product introductions.","In Europe, our constant dollar sales increased 2% on a year-over-year basis. Our business in Europe benefit from the 3% growth in the poultry market and a relatively flat beef and pork market. The European economy appears to be stabilizing, but the lack of GDP growth and essentially flat protein market continues to make it a challenging business environment. With that said, we had, again, favorable price\/mix cost spread in the quarter. I want to highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the second quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA of $159 million or 16.6% of net sales increased 8% compared to last year. This increase was largely attributable to price increases and adoption of our innovative product portfolio. Our focus on value-added selling has been, and will continue to be, a tremendous effort within Food Care. Despite the anticipated challenges in Q3 related to PED virus and cattle slaughter rate, we are still anticipating EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year.","On Slide 7, we highlight the result from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3%. Developing region increased 9%, with 15% growth in Latin America, 10% growth in Eastern European countries and 6% growth in AMAT. We delivered low single-digit growth in Southern Europe. And while one quarter doesn't set a trend, I must admit that the performance in Southern Europe it starts to become encouraging. Despite a tough year-on-year comparable in North America, constant currency sales were up 1% there, with growth in the U.S. offset by a decline in Canada.","And while we continue to focus our customer rationalization and realigning our cost structure, we're also making targeted investments in both sales and marketing and product development that will further differentiate Diversey Care in the marketplace. And despite the targeted spend, we delivered 12.4% EBITDA margins in the second quarter. Going forward, we still expect EBITDA margins expansion for the full year in 2014, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of this business and additional cost reductions that should positively impact the fourth quarter.","And now turning to Slide 8. Product Care delivered 3% constant currency sales growth, with variable price\/mix of 3% and on essentially flat volume. Constant currency sales growth in North America increased 5%, which was partially offset by a 2% decline in Europe. Similar to last quarter, we continued to see an increased demand for our e-commerce and third-party logistic customers for our packaging systems and cushioning solutions. Growth in this higher performance solutions was partially offset by a slight decline in general use, and sales in general use was impacted by rationalization and the lackluster economic environment in Europe. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16% to $71 million, or 17.3% of net sales. This is a 180-basis-point improvement compared to last year. The margin improvement is a direct result of the repricing actions on some of our products, especially foams and bubbles and mailers in North America and Europe. The Product Care teams focuses -- continues to focus on pricing discipline and getting paid for the value that they deliver, to allow for reinvestment in the future growth opportunities and innovation. And as we look ahead, volumes in Product Care will be negatively impacted by product rationalization. However, we expect to offset these declines with increased demand for our higher performance packaging solutions. Our packaging systems and cushioning product portfolio are designed to minimize freight cost, reduce damage cost and improve the consumer experience. And now let me turn the call over to Carol to review our net sales and EBITDA bridges, cash flow and outlook. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis, starting with the net sales bridge on Slide 9. Positive price\/mix of $66 million in the quarter was offset by a slight decline in volume of $8 million. Unfavorable currency translation of $22 million was mostly due to currency weakness in Argentina, Brazil, Australia and Turkey.","Turning to Slide 10 for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $284 million or 14.4% of net sales. We delivered a 50-basis-point improvement in gross profit margin and a 90-basis-point improvement in EBITDA margin. And within Food Care and Product Care, we had both gross margin and EBITDA margin expansion. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to a favorable mix and price cost spread of $37 million. Cost synergies of $25 million were more than offset by $33 million of higher SG&A and other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was also negatively impacted by $4 million of unfavorable currency.","Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42, as compared to $0.35 in the second quarter last year. As anticipated, the tax rate of 29.5% increased compared to last year, primarily due to the lapse of certain U.S. tax laws, including the research and development credit, as well as realizing greater earnings in the U.S. and other jurisdictions with higher tax rate.","Now turning to Slide 11. Let's look at our free cash flow. Free cash flow, excluding the $930 million payment under the Grace settlement agreement made in February, was the source of $112 million. This compares favorably to a source of $9 million in the 6 months ended June 30, 2013, partially due to higher earnings and an improvement in operating working capital management. Our operating working capital, as a percent of net sales, improved from 20% at June 30, 2013, to 18% at June 30, 2014. Our CapEx was $55 million, and cash restructuring costs were $50 million for the 6 month period. Cash payments related to SARs were $17 million in the first 6 months of 2014, compared with $28 million same period last year.","Turning to Slide 12. We have updated our debt maturity schedule post the recent refinancing of our credit facility. Last Friday, we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities, including repayment of the outstanding Term Loan B. The amended and restated facility provided for the refinancing of the Term Loan A, Term Loan B and revolving facilities. The company's new facilities, totaling $2.1 billion, are comprised of $1.3 billion of Term Loan A facilities and $700 million of revolving commitments. The company also established a new $100 million delayed-draw, Term Loan A facility. The amended and restated facility will provide approximately $15 million of annualized interest savings, in addition to maturity extension, more covenant flexibility and an increase in our restricted payment basket.","Turning to Slide 13. Let's highlight our updated guidance for the year. Based on our performance in the first and second quarters and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year 2014 guidance. For net sales, we estimate approximately $7.75 billion. This is a $50 million increase from previously provided guidance. It assumes an estimated unfavorable impact of approximately 1% from foreign currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70, as compared to the previously provided guidance of $1.50 to $1.60. The increased outlook for adjusted earnings per share is due to higher estimated adjusted EBITDA, plus lower interest expense in the second half of the year and a reduction in our shares outstanding. During the quarter, we completed a share repurchase of $130 million or approximately 3.9 million shares. We are still estimating the full year tax rate to be approximately 27%.","Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of approximately $1.085 billion to $1.095 billion, an increase from our prior guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion. We still expect full year adjusted EBITDA to improve in each of our 3 divisions as compared to 2013. The other category, which includes our medical and new ventures business and our corporate and unallocated cost, is now expected to be approximately $90 million of net cost, which is essentially in line with 2013. Our estimate for depreciation and amortization of $315 million remains unchanged. We are increasing our free cash flow outlook to approximately $485 million from $425 million, reflecting our higher EBITDA range, combined with lower CapEx, lower restructuring cost and reduced cash interest payments. We are now estimating capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million, due to the timing of certain projects moving from late Q4 into early 2015. For cash restructuring costs, we anticipate approximately $135 million, as the timing of execution of certain programs can be uncertain.","Cash interest payments are estimated to be approximately $7 million lower than our previous estimate of $280 million, as a result of the savings from the amended and restated credit facility. As you know, we are extremely focused on free cash flow generation and have initiatives in place to drive sustainable improvements in working capital, earnings growth and margin expansion. In our 2014 proxy, we highlighted that the board approved a special PSU award program, targeted at supporting the generation of increased cash flow. This program includes executive officers and a broader group of employees. For the special PSU award, we set a 3-year cumulative free cash flow goal for 2014, '15 and '16 to exceed $1.7 billion. The $1.7 billion excludes the $200 million tax refund we expect to receive in mid-2015 related to the Grace settlement. For the special PSU grant to be paid out, we must achieve our free cash flow goal and meet other metrics, including minimum earnings per share, working capital levels and total shareholder return. We continue to evaluate our total cost structure, and any additional cost reduction opportunities identified over the coming months are not expected to have a negative impact on our 3-year cumulative free cash flow goal of exceeding $1.7 billion.","To conclude my remarks, I would like to reiterate Jerome's excitement regarding the opportunities ahead. We are delivering on our commitment in staying focused on driving financial and operational excellence. We look forward to speaking with you again at our third quarter earnings conference call, which is tentatively scheduled for October 29 at 8:30 a.m.","Operator, can you please open up the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos, Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sorry, I jumped on a little bit late, you might have mentioned this earlier. My question is a little bit more top-down and away from the businesses, and it relates to the headquarters move. How much in savings do you expect to accrue from the move to new headquarters from the other facilities? Why couldn't you have accomplished whatever goals you're trying to achieve with this move in Elmwood Park, which is a relatively new facility as well, guys? And what's the deeper mission associated with this move?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thanks, George, good to hear you. And you missed, as you said, the earlier comments, because I explained the rationale of this move as part of our initiatives. And it is not an isolated initiative. It's just -- it's a whole plan to increase employee collaboration, to have -- to decrease the barriers between our divisions and our functions and add -- more than reduce costs. So today, you know very well that our headquarter are in Elmwood Park, New Jersey, that we have one product head -- one division, which is the Product Care division in Mayhew, New Jersey, that we have our Diversey Care in Amsterdam, that we have our Food Care division in South Carolina. We don't have one company here. We have -- if I push it, we have 3 companies. And when you bear in mind that you have R&D in their own facilities, and that we have scattered around the world some other parts of those divisions, then you understand that we can do much better. What I want is to offer our employees growth opportunities across divisions, across functions. I want a very collaborated environment, which is going to accelerate our \"Change the Game\" initiatives. So then the next question is why North Carolina? Because North Carolina is a good place to work from. It has a good airport. It has a good climate, it has a young population. It has affordable cost of living. It has proper local taxes. It has a good talent pool. It has lots of young people, and that makes it a very good place for us. We have had some support from the North Carolina government and this has helped the decision, but it is the whole things which I just talked about which are important. We need -- we are expecting cost synergies as a result of being all of us together, but it is not so much that. It is about being one, and my theme inside the company was the beginning of one company, the power of one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty, CS.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So with regard to pricing, you clearly are getting some solid traction, it looks like pricing, or price\/mix at least, accelerated in pretty much all the packaging businesses and a little bit of -- on the Diversey side as well. Do you feel that there's more room to go or are we plateauing here in terms of maybe extracting the value from -- for your products from your customers? How should we think about that going forward?","Jerome A. Peribere","So I must admit I'm really pleased with this change in culture in the company. We are making huge progress, and there is a little bit of mix, but there's a lot of price. When you look at our Product Care division, we have said that in North America, we have 5% price\/mix growth. Well, 4% of the 5% are price alone. And this is with volume, which in fact, did not decline, because we have a 10-basis-points volume reduction in North America. So you compare the 4% price and the 0.1% volume reduction in an environment where volume, in general, has not been very favorable, and you just see here a very simple example of how we're doing in pricing. And we're doing the same in every single region, because including in Europe, we had positive, we had about 1% price alone in Europe on Product Care. So it shows that it is about discipline. It is about who you want to be, and it is about creating the real value for our customers, but being respected for the value that we create. So when we move, you move to other type of businesses, Diversey Care is -- we have a little bit less of that, but it is still strong, and the reason why it's not like this is that what we are doing is that we're eliminating some bleeders and low-quality businesses, replacing them by better ones. But those are, generally speaking, contracts that we have with our customers, and it takes a little bit of time to do that. On Food Care, Food Care is very strong. We talked about price\/mix in North America of 3.4%, and the total price\/mix of 4.6% in the division, with just price in North America is 3%. And same for the rest of the world, where we have, in total, almost 4% price alone in that division. The volume in North America is slightly down, but much less down than the mega trends that we have been observed with the PED virus and with the beef cycle. Actually, in the third quarter, we believe that the beef cycle is going to continue to be down. If I have further questions in the queue, I will elaborate on that. So now the question is what's next? Well, we're not done. We're not done. We believe that we need to continue to recoup some price\/mix and we've made major progress. Well, I think we have made major progress when you look at this. But we are going to be very attentive to optimize our pricing, and we believe that we can do further progress. Over the mid-term, you've seen how much we have accomplished. In the past, we had a 13% EBITDA, 13.1% EBITDA in the first half of last year. We have 14% -- 14.1% EBITDA in the first half of this year, and we are intending to continue this progression in the future, and you have seen in our Investor Day our progress in -- and our targets for 2015 or 2016, and we're pretty dedicated to achieve those.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi, Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jerome, on the sales guidance increase for 2014, can you just give us some more color on the various components there? Are the beef and pork production issues less severe than you initially thought? Are you losing less market share than you perhaps thought you might as part of your bleeder initiative, if you will? And if you can also touch on the competitive behavior you're seeing both in Food and Protective Care as a function of the price increases you're leading in the market?","Jerome A. Peribere","Okay, so the guidance is, actually for the rest of the year, and therefore for the second half, is more guided towards the fourth quarter. Half of our division is Food Care, and what we've seen from official data is that the slaughter rates in beef are just -- I don't, know what adjective to use, year-to-date in beef, it is 6.8% down. And the slaughter rates are week-by-week since the third week of June, are minus 7, minus 11.8, minus 10 and last week was minus 11.6. So it just shows you that the slaughter rate is worsening, and this is why you heard in my prepared remarks that I believe that the -- we're probably going to reach the trough -- not probably, I believe that we're going to reach the trough in the third quarter. The pork rate slaughter rates are exactly the same, year-to-date, minus 4.7, and in the past few weeks, we reached minus 8.8, minus 9, minus 8.9. So that again is why I talked about the trough. So that's why in that environment, we're doing extremely well. We're doing -- we're continuing to progress in Food Care. We're going to -- we're continuing to progress in every single of those divisions and our, in staying with Food Care, our poultry business is doing quite well and globally and including in the U.S. When you move to Product Care, the packaging systems business is doing extremely well, and our general use is a little bit behind. And the reason is that we've been taking some pretty steep actions on pricing, and we intend to continue doing this, because some margins were just simply unacceptable. So the important thing in Product Care is related to our dimensional weight opportunity. This change that has been announced by FedEx and by UPS in charging volume, cube and not only weight, is provoking reactions from our customers who are asking for new and different solutions, and we have great solutions. So they are proactively working on this, and we have lots of conversations with many customers. And there might be some cannibalization out of some of our commodity type of product, lower value to some more performance packaging products, and we're working on this.","Operator","Your next question comes from Al Kabili, Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Jerome, I just wanted to follow on Ghansham's question, I guess, on the outlook. And it sounds like from your outlook that you see, and it's good to see it raise, but it sounds like you see sort of more moderate year-over-year EBITDA growth in the back half of the year versus what you experienced in the first half. And you mentioned some of the issues in North America on the Food Care side, but some of those issues were also still happening in the first half. Are you seeing anything else incrementally that sort of tempers that growth that you see in the back half from an earnings perspective, because it sounds like there's a lot of things happening positively on the price and cost side still?","Jerome A. Peribere","So the market is what it is, and we are -- I consider that we're beating the market and we're leading where we have to lead. You're correct when you say that the first half EBITDA of last year was at 13.1%, and we are -- we have delivered 14.1% in the first half of this year. The second half EBITDA was 13.9%, and we are projecting 14.1% or so or close to that, and therefore, you see that the delta is less incremental, but you have to look at the comps. We had announced some -- and implemented some steep price increases in the -- from November 1 last year, and we were very successful at those. So the comp is a little bit more difficult in there. Having said that, the sales growth is -- was 1.7% in the first half, and we're planning it at 1.2% in the second half. So yes, we are a little bit prudent with what we're seeing in the U.S. PED virus and in the beef cycle slaughter rates for the third quarter, but we're pretty confident in ending what I would call a pretty strong year, above plan. Carol might have something to add. Any comments, Carol?","Carol P. Lowe","Al, I think the relevant point is, as Jerome highlighted, as we move into the back half, especially Q4, we do have some difficult year-over-year comps because of a lot of actions that were taken last year and the references to the growth that we're expecting on the organic side, we do expect to still see second half growth, but we will continue to have some rationalization, especially with the keen focus with Product Care on some of the more general use type products, and switching our value investments and focus on the higher value products, but we will continue. What we always say is a good measure of quality of performance is if your EBITDA growth rate is exceeding your top line growth rate. We had strong performance in the first half for that for 2014 and for the full -- for second half and for the full year, our EBITDA growth rate will be significantly higher than our top line growth rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gabe Hajde, Wells Fargo.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is Gabe, on for Chris. First question revolves around the CapEx guidance, and I appreciate that sometimes projects get pushed out. But can you talk about what level of spending that you think is necessary kind of to support increased customer penetration or new product introduction, stuff like that? And if there's any spending incorporated into next year for the corporate move.","Carol P. Lowe","So the -- I'll address the corporate move first. The -- over a 3-year period, the net cash outflow is expected to be less than $20 million, and so it is not a material impact, and that's over a full 3-year period. And we do expect, on a net present value basis, longer term, we will have net savings with this consolidation. But that isn't really the driver. It's all the reasons that Jerome highlighted previously. As it relates to the capital projects, what we have said is that, on average, if we're spending somewhere around that $170 million, $200 million or even the way we look at it is our R&D investment and our CapEx investment together, being approximately $300 million, that, that is plenty to support our strategic plans, our growth initiatives to make the right investments in the right regions, in the right solutions, and to have the innovation level that we want. We're completely comfortable with that, and it will vary from year-to-year, how much is spent, R&D, versus how much is spent from a CapEx standpoint. The Diversey Care business is very low investment from a CapEx requirement. Our supply chain team continues to do just a phenomenal job across all 3 of the divisions in managing the footprint and getting the right capital in the right places to support the growth of the business. So we really are extremely comfortable anywhere between that $150 million to $200 million from a CapEx standpoint, that we can sufficiently support the business and provide opportunity for growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Philip Ng, Jefferies.","Alexander Hutter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is Alex Hutter, on for Phil. In Diversey, you saw good growth in volumes off a tough comp, and Europe seems to be recovering slowly. Price\/mix is a little bit less of a tailwind for the top line in the first quarter. Can you talk about the moving pieces in terms of mix and price in that segment as you shed the bleeders, and should we see price\/mix return to that kind of 3% range you saw in the first quarter?","Jerome A. Peribere","Diversey Care is a different animal in terms of the way you build contracts and things like this. So we need to be a little bit careful on this. So we had a total price\/mix of 1.9%, 2% in the second quarter. That is slightly less than the 3.2% of last year. In North America, we have slightly more than that, and we're quite pleased with this. And again, we have several sectors down there in Diversey Care. We have BSE, food service, hospitality, health care, retail, channel and all of these, and therefore, one size doesn't fit all. What I -- what is very clear is that we're very focused on eliminating low-quality customers. And when we come to bidding, we just change -- we're not hesitant to do that, as it was the case before. I have no issue with losing customers, provided they don't contribute. And we have seen some of that in the past, and actually, every time we have lost one, which would have low return, and passed that on to our competitors, we just went back and just took some other more value-add customers. That's the game.","Carol P. Lowe","And Alex, if I could add to that, one thing that is important, we've emphasized with Diversey Care that in terms of rightsizing the support structure to match with the revenues and where our focus is at, it does -- it has a little bit more of a lag than the Food Care business and the Product Care business at times. I would like to note for the second quarter that the Diversey Care team, they did a great job identifying certain businesses that they needed to exit because of the margins. And if you look specifically at the adjusted EBITDA bridge, you'll see that the volume reduction that we had on the top line, actually, although slight, it did positively contribute to improve total EBITDA dollars for the division for the quarter. So Ilham and the team, again, they continue to be focused on making sure we have the right match and cost structure and support, and that they can put a lot of their resources and investments towards innovation for the business. And as we've also noted, towards the latter half of 2014, we do expect to see the benefit of some of the cost reduction activities that the division is taking. So we're really pleased with the progress that they're making and the strategic plan that they have laid out for the entire business going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon, Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I have a couple of questions that just sort of relate to the cash flow in the next few years. One is, if you sort of look at where you started, how much more working capital cash squeeze do you think you still have? What kind of opportunities do you have there? And then, I guess, secondly, could you just talk about sort of the timing of when you were going to move the divisions from, I guess, their various locations, including the headquarters to the Charlotte campus? Is that next year or will that phase in over a few years?","Jerome A. Peribere","So let me start with that, and let me start, Chip, with your second question, so the timing of this move. So first, we're going to build the campus. That's going to take 2 years. So we already have a nice party organized for the Christmas of '16 in this campus. I want to celebrate that. I already invited the governor and our board. And of course, first, our employees, who are going to be unbelievably proud. In my career, I have seen what the benefits of a campus can be, and they are amazing. When you put everybody in functions and in businesses together, that's a huge difference with centralization by the way. But when you put the key people who can benefit from collaboration together, you have collaboration. It's extraordinary to see. So when is this going to happen? I said in, the new building, towards the third, fourth quarter of '16. In the meantime, we're going to organize waves of people moving, and we already have determined waves. And we're going to move into temporary offices. So that's how it's going to be working. With regards to cash flow, Carol made a comment on the special incentive, which is in the proxy that we published last April, without too much details. But she gave you a number, $1.7 billion is the threshold. And if we reach $1.7 billion of free cash flow for the years '14, '15 and '16, the payout is 0. So it is from there that it starts to pay there. So it is extremely important that we understand that, and the reason why there is a special incentive is to stretch our people to go and do that. So we're making huge progress on working capital as a percentage of net sales. Carol is going to give you some details, but we believe there is more. We moved from 20% in the first half of last year to 18%, and our goal is to continue making progress in there. We are not tolerating bad news. We are not tolerating bad debts, and those kind of things, and we already -- we had $212 million at December of 2012 as bad news. I come from a culture where this is a no-no, and we have a moral contract with our customers, and this moral contract is I deliver on quality, on time, you pay on time, and there's nothing special about these kind of things. Carol, you want to add something?","Carol P. Lowe","So Chip, at the end of June this year, we have -- still have $1.4 billion invested in working capital, simple operating working capital, so your trade receivables, plus your inventory less your payables. So there's still opportunity. We've made great year-over-year improvement. Our DSO is down 3 days versus June of 2013. Our DPOs have improved by 2 days. Inventory days on hand has improved by 2 days. However, we've made the improvement on the past dues, but we still had approximately $140 million past-due outstanding at the end of June. So there's still opportunity there. We have a lot of key initiatives underway, with great focus, cross functional focus, full business support in terms of sales and operations planning, SKU optimization, simplification. So we feel like there's still very meaningful opportunity for us from a working capital standpoint, but the other thing to keep in mind is our -- while we're very focused on this and we believe that being at 18% working capital as a percent of net trade sales, we still got a long ways to go to get to world-class. And Sealed Air has that potential to have world-class working capital metrics. So again, the focus in addition to working capital, we will continue to have quality of earnings, which means expanding our EBITDA, expanding our EBITDA margin. That will also greatly contribute to free cash flow. So we feel like we still have tremendous opportunity. The board did set a stretch goal for the company in exceeding $1.7 billion, but we're very focused on it, because it benefits our ability to reinvest in the company, as well as return value to shareholders.","Jerome A. Peribere","It really is, interesting comment that Carol made here, is that when you compare us with many other companies, most companies today, after the global crisis in the last 4 years, are at peak margins, and that's not our case. We believe, and we know that we are not at peak margins. We have proven that we are progressing and we're -- I'm confirming that we have ways to go and to improve our margins. So our cash flow is not going to only come from squeezing. It is going to come from eliminating the waste where we have waste, and we have made huge progress on this, but it is also going to come from improving our margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Ovshey, Goldman Sachs.","Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Usha Guntupalli on behalf of Alex. Most of my questions have been answered, but I have one quick one. So given your focus on pricing for some time now, have you seen competitor and\/or customer behaviors toward price change materially? And specifically, have you had any customers you lost initially because of price come back to you for your value proposition?","Jerome A. Peribere","So that is a very good question, because what we -- there is always the gaining and losing of customers, and sometimes it is about price. Sometimes it is about something else. And let me assure you that we are also gaining customers based on price, not because of we reducing prices, but because of the value proposition. I cannot repeat enough to you what I've been saying internally, is that our #1 job, our #2 job, our #3 job, is to be obsessed with helping our customers win. That is, and I word the word obsessed, because I want every single of our people to understand that this is our job and only our job. And -- but this does not mean that making our customers win should go through price reduction. Actually, I'm asking our people to make sure that we are respected by our customers for the value that we create to them, and it is common practice to -- and obvious, to say that customers choose their suppliers, all right? Well, what I'm telling them, our people internally also is choose your customers, and you need to make sure that you are happy with your customer mix. That if you only deal with the pricing driven customer, you are never going to get there. Because for those of us who are pricing seekers, we are never satisfied. The minute we find a cheaper price, we want another cheaper price. So I want our people to choose better their customers, and we're achieving this. So to cut the story short, are we losing business? Yes, we are. Are we winning business? Yes, we are. Are we losing business then because of our pricing? Very little. Look at what we have been doing in our Product Care division, which had the biggest pricing repositioning of recent time. North America, we had 4% price in the second quarter. Our volume in North America is minus 0.1%, and I don't think the market has been positive in the whole of protective packaging world in the second quarter. And as a result of that, it's just to prove that we can be respected for the value we create. And it's the same in the Food Care. I don't think that we have lost share. Actually, we might pretty well have gained share in the -- in all kind of packaging and also beverage businesses, and we're doing pretty well. Because when you look at our volume, again in North America, as an example, we have lost 1% in volume, but our pricing only in North America has been 3%. And in Europe, we gained volume in Food Care, and we gained price. So I think this is just a proof of what's going on in the marketplace.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of John McNulty, CS.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I had a question regarding your cash flow. So your cash flow, it looks like if you pull out the restructuring charges, you're pretty much already at your 2016 target. So it looks like things are going well there. I guess, can you walk us through, I guess, first of all, if you think there's upside to that target or if we kind of plateau on the free cash flow generation here? And then also, how to think about the uses for that? I know it sounds like you freed up some ability to buy back more stock around the credit refinancing, but maybe an update there as to how much you can buy back now, and then also what kind of -- which pieces of debt you may be able to take out with some of the cash that you're generating over the next 12 months as well?","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. Thank you, John. So obviously, the $1.7 billion, exceeding that amount over that 3-year period ending 2016 with our current outlook for 2014 at $485 million, it definitely would imply that the 2016 target that we shared of $600 million on our Analyst Day, that we would exceed that. We would need to exceed it, and so you can kind of estimate the math in between. We're not going to provide 2015 numbers now or specifically update the 2016 amounts that we provided at Analyst Day, but obviously, it has to be higher than $600 million for us to exceed $1.7 billion. In terms of the uses for the cash, we've been really clear that we do have a goal of returning value to shareholders, which we have defined, in addition to the company performing better, having higher earnings, making the right investments. So we do have the quality growth for the company that investors seek. We also want the opportunity, as we move below 4x leverage, that we look at our dividends, as well as potential share repurchases. We did have the Q2 share repurchase from the Grace trust. Right now, with the refinancing of our credit facility, that was our limitation before, because we can only repurchase approximately $150 million worth under the restricted payment basket once we took out what we pay in dividends. With the refinancing of those facilities, they are no longer the limitation from a restricted payment basket. It's actually our senior notes or bonds. And right now, based on those limitations for the basket, it's approximately $200 million a year. Based on what we've already executed, we could do an additional $70 million this year if we had the right opportunity. When we look -- but there were some carryover from last year. If we look at 2015, that basket is probably limited to around $80 million that we could do in 2015. However, we've also been very clear that we would be opportunistic, and we would consider possible activities or market transactions that would alleviate that current restriction. But again, we'll be opportunistic. It has to be the right timing. It has to be the right returns for investment. And our leverage, still we're not within that 3.5 to 4 range that we're ready to move ahead right this minute with something, but it is definitely on our list, and we'll respond as we believe is appropriate for the company and for our investors.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you.

This call is being recorded. Leading the call today: Jerome A. Peribere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol P. Lowe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Chaitman.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR site at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can also find on our website.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.","Please note that we'll end the call by noon today. Now I will turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Lori, and welcome to our first earnings call as our IR VP. And good morning to everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter financial results and operational performance across a number of key metrics. Before I get into the detailed results, I think it is important to mention that I have been at Sealed Air for 11 months exactly now, and the change from where we were when I got here to where we are today is night and day.","Our second quarter performance is a true testament to the progress we have made, and our employees are engaged, and I want to thank all 25,000 of them for their commitment. And I know that like me, they are eager to keep it up because there is still a lot to be done.","With that said, let's start with Slide #2. On Slide #2, we highlight our top line and adjusted EBITDA results for the quarter. Sales were up 1.9% on an as-reported basis and up 3.2% on a constant currency basis. All our divisions reported net sales growth on a year-over-year basis despite the continued challenge in the macroeconomy.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.1% increased 27%, excluding the impact of stock appreciation rights, or SARs. The increase in EBITDA was driven by margin expansion in both our Food & Beverage and Institutional & Laundry divisions. We are seeing the benefits of operational improvement programs across the organization, which include manufacturing efficiencies, cost containment and synergies.","On the pricing front, we are making progress in the marketplace in each of the divisions, and we'll discuss these initiatives later in the call.","Slide 3 of our presentation highlights the top line results by region. We continue to see solid growth in Latin America, where we achieved 12% constant dollar sales growth; and in AMAT, standing for Asia, Mid East, Africa and Turkey, where we had 11% constant sales growth. The growth in regions in total increased 9% and accounted for approximately 26% of our total sales.","The team is doing a great job penetrating the marketplace and growing our business with existing customers in addition to building a new customer base locally. Brazil, Turkey and China delivered double-digit sales growth on a constant currency basis. While we had strong growth in China in the first half of the year, we are closely monitoring the economy, as recent trends have indicated some deceleration.","In North America, we increased sales 2% with low single-digit growth in the United States and almost 9% growth in Canada. In Europe, where our business is being impacted by weak economies, sales were essentially flat on a constant currency basis. To be more specific, Germany and the U.K. have increased modestly, but France was down in the high single digits and Italy was down by more than 10%. These 4 countries combined make up approximately 15% of our total sales.","And in Japan and ANZ, where sales were slightly down, Australia was flat and New Zealand declined by almost 10% due to weakness, particularly in the Food & Beverage division, mostly from drought and its impact on the dairy market.","Turning to Slide 4 and moving to the businesses. Food & Beverage sales increased 4% on a constant dollar basis. Regionally, we continued to experience above-market growth in AMAT and in Latin America, where we benefit from not only rising beef production prices but also our breadth of innovative solution -- product and sanitation solutions in Food & Beverage.","Constant currency sales increased 18% in AMAT and 13% in Latin America. China increased by more than 30%. Africa was up 8%, and Brazil was up 13%. In Argentina, we achieved 35% constant currency growth, or 15% on an as-reported basis.","In North America and Europe, our more mature markets, where we are currently in a down cycle for beef production, our growth is driven by our ability to provide our customers with value-added services and new applications. Examples of value-added services include helping our currency -- our customers minimize operations downtime and increase automation. Examples of new applications include those for fresh red meat, such as Darfresh, Grip & Tear, Simple Steps and Oven Ease. These innovative applications are driving stronger equipment sales and a more favorable product mix.","So while beef production in North America increased approximately 1% and Europe declined by approximately 1%, we increased sales in North America by just over 2%, and Europe was relatively flat. Constant currency sales increased 12% in Germany and 5% in the U.K. but were offset by continued economic weakness in France, Italy and Spain.","I want to briefly highlight the progress remaining on our new -- we're making on our new pricing discipline and the EBITDA margin performance that F&B delivered in the quarter. EBITDA margins increased to 14.7% from 11.9% last year, excluding the impact of SARs. The margin expansion was primarily driven by a more favorable product mix, higher volume and onetime manufacturing costs included in 2012. Our new pricing discipline in F&B is progressing, but it is still a work in progress, as we have some customers on formula.","As we have discussed for many months now, our sales efforts are focused on bringing value-added solutions to our customers and selling higher-performance products, such as the products I previously mentioned. We remain steadfast on our commitment to more than recover material costs.","Slide 5 highlights the results from our Institutional & Laundry division. I&L net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3%. In Q2, we saw strong growth across most countries and sectors in AMAT and Latin America, resulting in double-digit constant currency sales growth. India increased 13%, and Turkey, Brazil and China grew approximately 8% to 9%. Argentina performed well, with constant currency growth of 35% or 15% on a reported basis.","In North America, we were pleased to see another quarter with positive volume growth. This was due to the combination of new customer wins in health care, increased building care chemical sales in the retail sector and the product launch of our floor care equipments.","In Europe, which accounts for almost half of the I&L sales, we reported a 1.2% decline in constant currency, which was slightly better than recent quarters. And our business is still challenged in Southern Europe, which declined in the mid-single-digit range, but this decline was partially offset by positive trends in Eastern Europe.","Adjusted EBITDA margins improved to 12.4% from 9.6% last year, excluding the impact of SARs, and the key driver behind the margin expansion was increased sales and cost containment and synergies. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be a seasonally very strong quarter for us. And given the fixed cost structure of this division, which is heavy manpower intensive, you can see the leverage.","Turning now to Slide 6, our Protective Packaging division delivered a 0.9% increase in sales on a reported basis and an increase of nearly 2% on a constant dollar basis. From a regional perspective, sales in North America increased approximately 3%, partially offset by a slight decline in Europe. Sales in the U.K., Germany and Italy were flat to up 1%, while France, again, declined by more than 10%. Not surprisingly, this business is highly sensitive to the global industrial economy, and we experienced decelerating trends throughout the quarter. In the U.S., we had unfavorable product mix with continuous growth in e-commerce and retail and also suffered from distribution destocking inventory.","We held firm on price and walked away from low-quality businesses, particularly in Europe. And on a global basis, we are getting better pricing across the full product portfolio. And as a result, gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to last year. While this is encouraging, gross margins did not improve enough to offset increased expenses. And we're making some progress on price, but there's still some work to do.","And now I will turn the call over to Carol to further discuss our second quarter financial results and highlight our outlook for the remainder of 2013.","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. If you're following along with our presentation, Slide 7 provides a bridge for the 2% year-over-year net sales growth. Volumes contributed $46 million. Price\/mix was $15 million positive, driven by favorable trends in F&B and I&L. Currency translation was $23 million unfavorable, primarily driven by declines in Latin American currency.","Slide 8 reflects the adjusted EBITDA bridge from second quarter 2012 to second quarter 2013. Volume contributed $18 million and mix & price\/cost spread contributed $4 million to the improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Cost synergies were $20 million in the quarter. The favorable $17 million for SG&A and other includes approximately $9 million related to the net impact of plant consolidations and relocation projects in the Food & Beverage division that negatively impacted results in the second quarter 2012, as Jerome previously mentioned.","SARs expense was immaterial this quarter, but in the second quarter last year, SARs was actually $9 million positive. While the amount of SARs expense is not linear with the change in the value of Sealed Air stock price, based on the current number of SARs outstanding, we estimate that every $1 change in our stock price impacts EBITDA by approximately $2 million. As of the end of June, we had $1.9 million SARs outstanding. Obviously, as this number of outstanding changes, so does the impact on EBITDA.","Now turning to Slide 9. In the 6 months ending June 30, free cash flow was a source of $12 million. This was a $140 million improvement over the first 6 months of 2012. The significant improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to higher net earnings and lower CapEx. CapEx in the first 6 months of 2013 was $51 million compared to $66 million for the same period a year ago. Our primary use for free cash flow generation remains focused on reducing leverage.","Our outlook for the remainder of 2013 is summarized on Slide 10. We're maintaining our full year 2013 net sales to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA is tracking toward the high end of the guidance we previously provided of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion. We are also tracking toward the high end of our previously forecasted range for earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.20.","We continue to expect our full year free cash flow to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which compares with $280 million for the year ended 2012.","This may see modest given our performance in the first half. However, we still expect capital expenditures to be $160 million and cash restructuring to be $135 million for the full year 2013, and both of those spends are more heavily loaded towards the second half of the year. We are also assuming higher cash SARs payments in 2013 than in 2012.","Our core tax rate for the second quarter 2013 was 23.8%. This compares with 27.1% for the second quarter last year. We expect our core tax rate to be approximately 25% for the full year. Interest expense for this year, full year, is expected to be approximately $355 million. This includes $290 million of cash interest expense.","Before turning the call back to Jerome to lead the Q&A, I'd like to note that we've included, in the appendix of the presentation, a summary of our second quarter adjusted earnings per share calculation. We believe you'll find this schedule useful to understand the math as you move from adjusted EBITDA to adjusted earnings per share. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you. Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to remind you that our Analyst Day will be held on September 20 in New York City. It will be a half-day event starting at 8:00 a.m. at the Sofitel Hotel. The Sealed Air leadership team will present to you a review of each of our divisions, provide a mid-term outlook and share our strategic priorities, outlining our long-term goals.","Operator, I'd like to open up the call for any questions from the participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Margin in I&L was a little stronger than we would have expected. It looks like the synergy's really flowing through during the quarter, and volumes obviously helped. But how should we be thinking about the cadence of the margins in the coming quarters? And should we expect synergies to pick up a little bit here? And I do understand there's some seasonality with the business.","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you. Yes, we -- I mean, we had good leverage. We've communicated previously that this business does have a fixed -- high fixed cost structure because it's very service intensive. Also, as Jerome noted, our second quarter is very seasonally strong. And because of that, you do see the benefit of that leverage we talk about. We also had the benefit of cost savings that have helped partially offset inflationary costs. However, with that, there is some caution related to the economy, Europe, China deceleration. Jerome highlighted that France has been down significantly. Tourism in France is down 10%. You've got the issues in Turkey with Taksim Square, and everyone is well aware of what's going on in Egypt. And a lot of this business, especially through the summer months, is driven by tourism. So based on that and the fact that we've also highlighted, while we're working on our new earnings quality improvement program, and that will benefit the Institutional & Laundry business, especially beginning in 2014, we won't see any savings from the earnings quality improvement program for them for 2013 because we have to go to a lot of works councils and have those negotiations. So we feel really good about the performance for I&L. But because of some of the headwinds at a top line basis, we feel like we need to be modest as we look towards the balance of the year.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So should we expect margins to step down a little bit in Q3?","Carol P. Lowe","Well, I guess, we don't really provide margin guidance by any of the divisions specifically. We provide EBITDA for full year, but we don't give margins.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then on pricing for across the board, it seems like a little stronger than expected. But if you look at F&B, your margins were kind of in line with expectations. When should we really start seeing real net pricing? I guess it's more of a 2014 event, but can you kind of endcap what the leverage -- that could be going down the road?","Jerome A. Peribere","So we are seeing a very good effect already on our margin because pricing has 2 components. One thing is the raw materials that you pass or you don't, and this also depends on how strong we are seeing those materials go up. We have seen also margin expansion. So this is, for us, the important thing. And it is, of course, not across the board and not across the regions. Let me start with the bad news. We're seeing it, for example, in F&B that in Western Europe, our pricing margin expansion has been -- has not been good because the situation is extremely difficult there. But we've seen, selectively, some good progress in some specific countries and very good results, also, on low-margin products. But when we don't have pricing success, we're going back, and this is across the board. What I just mentioned here was F&B. In North America, we're seeing progress in there, again, selectively. But we're seeing that we have had some selective progress there because, on some product lines, we have quite a lot of business on formula. And the formulas are starting to kick in since May and June, depending on the product line. Some other regions have been showing very nice growth in pricing, for example, in Latin America, where we've seen substantial progress on our pricing actions and such. On Protective Packaging, we have not pushed sales because we voluntarily went out of some product lines or some products where we had low margins. So when we look at the sales growth in Q2 of our Protective Packaging business, we have -- I'm actually not looking at it very much because I have pushed our people to show determination in our pricing situation. So this is what we have observed as a result of this: we have had some sales down in Europe, but we have seen also some nice margin expansions because of our initiatives.","Operator","And your next question comes in the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to circle up on the I&L business. And to what degree do you think the -- that price\/cost spread that you saw in the second quarter is -- of $5 million is sustainable throughout the remainder of the year?","Carol P. Lowe","So Al, as the -- it sort of goes along with the comments that I provided just on the first question. We do expect that we will continue to see improved performance in I&L as we move forward based on a lot of changes that are happening -- taking place, and the year-over-year comps will be favorable from that standpoint in terms of some of the challenges that were faced in the prior year. But again, we do have some slight caution because this business is so driven by top line because of that cost structure. So it's going to be very dependent on the sales and what they maintain for the balance of the year, and there are some concerns out there with what's going on in Western Europe.","Jerome A. Peribere","The -- let me add a little bit of flavor here. Number one, you know the seasonality of this business, which is heavily loaded towards Q2. Second, we are going to be slightly negatively impacted by our -- by the change in currency and by a few selective events in countries, which are important to us. The -- Turkey is an important country, and what we have seen is that as the events were developing in June on Taksim square, we had our customers load some business -- or load some product in order to prevent any disruption. And as a result -- and what we have seen also is that the tourism in Istanbul and in some parts of Turkey has suffered since then from some quite a few cancellations. We have seen the same events or situation in Egypt where our month of June has been strong in anticipation for preventing product delivery disruptions. And I don't know to which extent you know that, but tourism right now in Egypt is a complete disaster. And in Western Europe, the season is not very good because of all the Latin countries are actually doing very poorly in this kind of business altogether. So I think that we've got to take things as they are. We're very pleased with the initiatives that Ilham has taken, very pleased. She has announced just 2 weeks ago, internally, a reorganization of her business, and this organization is around simplifying it in order to ensure clarity, simplicity and affordability. We are going to see, over time, the benefits of these initiatives. And she's taking out, also, bleeders. And this is going to have an impact on our top line, but over time, a positive impact on our bottom line.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. That's helpful. Just -- and the follow-up question is you highlighted conservatism on some of these -- the items you noted. Can you just tell or talk to us about how July volume trends are going across each of the segments so far?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, we just don't give guidance specifically. But I gave you a flavor on the I&L business, which is in there. And overall, we are -- well, again, I don't want to give specific guidance to -- onto Q2. But the seasonality is in there, and we have a slight currency impact for the second half of the year. We believe that this might have -- that these currencies stay at level where they are, this is going to have about a $10 million negative impact on the second half of the year. So when you do $1 million -- $1 billion of EBITDA, you have 1% which is just one-off there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just on Protective Packaging, you talked about walking away from some business there, as well as just some of the price progress you're looking to make. I guess what I was wondering was, there are some headwinds on the SG&A, et cetera. So I was wondering how you're thinking about some of the cost containment initiatives and the potential around those as we progress through the rest of the year.","Jerome A. Peribere","So we are -- yes, we had slightly higher expenses in Protective Packaging, and the reason is that we are investing in one specific segment, which is the e-commerce segment. That's one. We are, on the other side, taking notice of the clear trends with regards to Europe. We are reorganizing our business in Europe and taking cost out once again. Given the labor unions, given the overall work environment, we -- this takes a little bit of time. But that's for the expense part. With regards to the pricing, we have -- we determined we are moving from some of our -- we're moving from some of our product lines with determination here. We're seeing more price actions across the whole portfolio that we have seen in a very long time. And we're implementing more price increase in the second half to address the raw material inflation and the lag that we have had in our pricing in the first half. Note to note, still work to do. But overall, we are very clear with where we want to go in this. This is an industry, which is fairly undisciplined, but we're doing what we have to do. We have lost some accounts. In some of our polyurethanes business, we have lost some accounts. And on shrink film, also, we have implemented our price increases. We lost some accounts, but -- and in some cases, we have not recovered our cost increases, and we'll go back.","Operator","Your next question comes in the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jerome, still trying to figure out Protective Packaging. Because it sounds like you walked away from some business, but volumes were still very, very good in the context of some of the broader economic weakness that a lot of the peer group has called out during the quarter. I know that the international markets were quite strong for that business. So can you help us understand what exactly is happening? I know you called out e-commerce, et cetera. But how does the margin profile for the international portion of that business compare to the North American portion?","Jerome A. Peribere","So in -- first of all, the segments, we are -- we are more selective than we were in the past. And you know that I want to change the profile of those businesses. Traditionally, the e-commerce business is very price driven and, generally speaking, slightly lower-margin business. That is our existing business. I will take that business towards more value add through systems because we have lots of technologies, which can add tremendous value to the fulfillment operations of our customers and 3PL. But our mailers business, our bubble business, et cetera, are traditionally low-margin businesses there. In Europe, we've seen a lot of weakness. The auto industry has been extremely weak, and the auto industry, for us, was traditionally -- is traditionally a strong, high-value type of business because there's a lot of cushioning there. May has been very weak. June has been a little bit better in Europe, but the economies are what -- you know what they are. In our shrink business, we're making a lot of progress because we are much more selective in our customer approach, and we have new technologies, and we intend to extract the value of those businesses. Our general use business, which is our packaging systems, where there is equipment and where there -- and where we have Fill-Air type of products, it's been doing quite well in North America, in the U.S. Our sales there have been going 5% up, which is pretty good. But as I said before, we are more selective because I'm determined to take this business to higher-quality businesses.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And just in terms of Institutional & Laundry, just as a clarification, where you basically saying that a portion of that business benefited from a prebuy based on the events in Turkey and Egypt? And can you sort of put some financial parameters around that?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you. What we have seen is, in some of those countries, we've seen a little bit of this, which is very understandable because of what -- of the people not knowing and the businesses not knowing how the events were going to be developing. So you've got some -- but these are selective. What we think is that in China, there's been -- there's not been prebuying. But what was clearly double digits -- we've got pretty nice I&L growth in Asia, but the difference is that, that growth has gone -- has decelerated in a country like China, for example. But it was nice. If I remember well, it was 17% in the first quarter, and we were at about 9% in the second quarter. We had some great parts. India has been doing very nice. Africa has been doing very well. But as I said, the pace in China has been slightly lower in I&L.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alax Wang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Alaxandar Wang - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sitting in for George Staphos today. Can you just talk about maybe your learnings from recent awards for Diversey, maybe more specifically what field area is doing well and what needs to be done better?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, I think what we've been doing well is that we have reorganized this business to simplify it. It was a little bit convoluted, and Ilham Kadri has announced her reorganization, as I said, 2 weeks ago. That's one. Number two, she has been addressing, very seriously, our bleeders. And therefore, we are -- there are some businesses, which were -- or some customers, which are -- were having absolutely unacceptable returns. And we're just walking away from those kind of businesses. We're not renewing them. We are, every time, negotiating our contracts in a better way than we were before. So all of this goes to clarity, it goes to affordability, and it goes to simplification. And all of this is going to be work in progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jerome, just wanted to talk about I&L here for a minute. You mentioned, in the slides, new customer wins and account penetration in Latin America and AMAT. I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more color, first, on the new customer wins, what market segments that's coming from, whether that's retail, lodging, health care, et cetera. And can you talk a little bit more about this account penetration -- I'm assuming that's existing accounts, sort of how that's progressing? Is that -- I remember you added sales people in order to do that. Is that -- is this the beginning of that program? And how much longer can we see some benefits from that?","Jerome A. Peribere","So we are -- we're keeping a track on our customer wins and customer losses, et cetera. And let me assure you that we're very happy about that. And of course, customer wins and losses, you get them from and to everyone in the industry. Our -- in North America, our new customer wins are specifically in health care and increased building care chemical sales in the retail business. We also have been launching -- you know that our TASKI machines were mostly European based. You know that we have suffered because of lack of investments in our customer base in Europe. We have suffered from lowering sales in that part of the world. Well, it's the opposite in U.S. because we have launched those machines last year, and we're seeing a very, very good pickup. Those equipment are superior equipment compared to what is existing in the industry. And when I say superior is that those equipments are -- but I would say they are Swiss made. They are Swiss made. But they are very, very high quality with very low maintenance cost, with lower water and longer battery life than our competitors. And our customer -- it's a great value proposition for our customers. So we're having very nice momentum and regaining traction on this business, which is having growth. In the European markets, we are having some nice customer wins. Every time we're taking this, these customers, we're taking them at higher margins. We -- having single-digit EBITDA in this business is clearly, clearly unacceptable. So every single contract that we're taking is at higher margins. You don't take -- you renew contracts on the 3-year or 5-years basis, et cetera, and we are working on this. And our value proposition is about the value created to our customers. It is not about the fee base. It is not about those kind of things. And that's the way we're tackling this business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Couple -- I had 2 questions for you, 1 on cash flow, 1 on the pricing initiatives you've undertaken. First, on the pricing initiatives. Recognizing, as you just said, that some of these are couple-of-year contracts, and aside from the adjustments that are happening mechanically, the up and down materials pieces, if you're in the process of going through and raising prices, could you handicap or maybe give us a sense of where you are in the process? What portion of your contracts have you been able to address or portion of your portfolio have you been able to address? And has there been any response in the -- from the competitive landscape thus far?","[indiscernible]","Jerome A. Peribere","We're -- it's difficult to answer your question, Chris, because we have 3 very different businesses. We have a Food business, which itself is about hygiene and sanitation, with contracts, which are on 3 to 5 years. Then, we have Packaging, food packaging business, which is on -- some of which is on pricing formulas, some of which is negotiated. And then we have the Diversey I&L business, which is also contracts, and I already talked about this. What I want to assure you about is that, as quoted by the financial leader of the Protective Packaging division 2 days ago when we were reviewing our July S&OP, there is -- there's never been as much attention and push towards improving the quality of our business through margin expansion. We saw 20 basis points. Am I happy with 20 basis points at the gross profit level absolute improvement? Absolutely not. But this was an organization, which was looking at volume. It was almost forbidden to lose an order. That is not the case anymore. We are -- we have some bleeders, as I said. We have some product lines, which are, by far, not getting the return on capital invested, and we are working on those. So you have some price formulas. They are going to be favorable to us unless our polyethylene supply has jacked up the price again in the rest of the year. But we should recoup some of that in margins later in the year in the -- hopefully, in the third quarter. The -- some of these are just negotiations. When we have negotiations, our people are, by definition, seeing resistance. I've never seen a purchaser tell me that our products are too cheap. But they understand because it's not only about price. It is about quality. It is about the value we create to them, et cetera. So this is -- there's a cultural shift. It is going to take time, but we are seeing some good attention and movements.","Carol P. Lowe","But Chris, you had a question also on cash flow?","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My follow-up question was just regarding cash flows. As we look at this year, you talked about $135 million of cash out for restructuring, $160 million of CapEx. As these programs wind down, maybe could you talk to us a little bit about -- I recognize you're probably going to give more of this on your Analyst Day in a few weeks, but how that looks the next couple of years? Are you largely done restructuring at this point? Will that -- some of that continue in the next -- maybe the direction of each of those the next couple of years?","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. So we had announced 2 programs. One was the original Integration and Optimization Program that was part of the Diversey acquisition. That program, the total cash cost was provided at $235 million, $70 million of which we will have this year. That makes up part of that total $135 million. The savings for that total program is $195 million to $200 million. We've indicated that we would expect to have approximately $90 million in savings for the full year 2013. That program is largely done at the end of this year. The new earnings quality improvement program that we announced with our first quarter earnings call, the total cost of that program was in the range of $180 million to $200 million with total savings of about $80 million by the end of 2015. The cash cost for 2013, $65 million. Savings that we will realize in 2013 are 0 to negligible, largely because the biggest portion of this new program is related to Europe and getting our cost structure correct there across all 3 of the primary businesses. So we'll reach that run rate of $80 million by the end of 2015. If you want to look at that $80 million, you would say slightly more than half should be realized in 2014. We don't, right now, have additional programs. We have indicated, it's not our intent to be a serial restructurer. We want to get a steady-state business and then focus on improvement of the business each and every day. However, it doesn't mean if we don't have large opportunities and meaningful opportunities to improve the cost structure for the business that we won't take advantage of them.","Jerome A. Peribere","A quick one here, a quick add-up here. We -- on our CapEx of $160 million, we have been prudent. We didn't know at the beginning of the year how the year was going to unfold. So the instructions that Carol and I gave were extremely clear: we'll go slow into our spending because what is spent is spent. So we've been very slow in the first half on our capital spending. And as a result of that, because we have to do what we have to do in our plans, we are going to be spending more in the second half. And this is why -- this is one of the main reasons, other than the ones Carol talked to you about, for not increasing our guidance in our cash flow for the total year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I know you guys don't like to provide guidance, but since these are new segments, can you give us just some kind of ballpark for how you think about margins in each of these segments if we look out 3 to 5 years?","Carol P. Lowe","We'll -- Mark, we will have more color when we have our Investor Day. That's when we'll have a little more detail by division. So we look forward to seeing you in September.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, I'll -- we'll wait for that. Then I just wondered, as a follow-on, Jerome, it sounds like your view of the second half is that your biggest challenges are still uncertainty around volume. Can you just confirm that?","Jerome A. Peribere","Yes. Well, seasonality, I'm looking at -- I can imagine that many of you are saying, \"This is being sandbagged, and those guys have $0.35 and they're sandbagging the second half.\" No, we want to be credible. I would summarize by saying we've got $10 million. Unless the dollar devalues, we've got $10 million of the EBITDA level here to take into account because of change of currency. We've got seasonality. We've got some few here -- things here and there on the I&L business because of the countries I talked to you about. And this economy is not strong. I was listening to NPR this morning in the car going -- coming to the office, and somebody was making the comment, saying that we are in the fourth year of the recovery, and it doesn't feel like a recovery because it's the first time ever that things, 4 years within the recovery, are feeling so iffy. So when -- our protective business is heavily dependent -- we're talking about 15% to 20% being on e-commerce. It means that 80% to 85% is based on industry. Well, industry is not doing well, and we're seeing that in our Protective Packaging in China, for example. It's not doing well. And we do have a few nice spots, but we've got to be reasonable here. And when I look at our EBITDA in the first half, and when I look at how we've been doing as a percentage of our total EBITDA or our total sales in the first half compared to the second half from a historical perspective, I'm reinforcing the guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The Food & Beverage segment, of course, saw a very meaningful $27 million improvement in EBITDA year-over-year. Would you be able to help us parse that out and talk about how much of the EBITDA improvement was in the hygiene subsegment and how much was in the packaging solutions subsegment?","Carol P. Lowe","Yes. We've provided the information at the top line in terms of the sales piece of it, but we're not breaking out the EBITDA between those 2 components. Proportionately, the food packaging side of it is much larger than the hygiene piece of it, so we would see more impact from what happens within that business.","Jerome A. Peribere","And having said that, we are -- our star region is AMAT and Latin America in that respect. Our hygiene business is kicking butt there, and we're doing really well.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Maybe if I could just ask the question slightly differently. Just historically, what was the normal margin on that hygiene piece of the business on historical -- on the historical basis? Can you just comment on that?","Carol P. Lowe","Mid-single digit.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mid-single digit, okay. And then just last question for me on -- is there any update from you on the W.R. Grace situation?","Carol P. Lowe","Yes, so just a quick update. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, they held -- heard oral arguments on June 17 on the -- there's 5 pending appeals. On July 24, the court entered an opinion and judgment relating to Garlock's appeal, and they affirmed the District Court's decision, and they overruled Garlock on the settlement plan. The court has yet to rule on the other outstanding appeals. We don't know when the Third Circuit Court may or may not rule on those, so we are kind of wait and see until that happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jerome, perhaps you plan to address this at the Investor Day, but where do you expect most of your longer-term margin improvement to come from: pricing in excess of cost inflation, ridding yourself of unprofitable business, cost reductions, volume growth or some combination of the above? And which do you think will be the biggest factor or 2 factors? I know some of these might go hand in hand, but I just wanted to hear how you think about the issue.","Jerome A. Peribere","You answered. You answered, Adam. I am determined to lead this company towards a higher-quality company. As I said several times, this company is going to be -- is going to have a 16% EBITDA level before it gets -- it becomes a $10 billion company. And I -- for this, we need to change the culture of this organization. We need to make people more hungry to gain quality business, more selective. We need to accept that there's some product lines, which have aged and that we are not interested in. So this is why you have seen our productivity ratio of expense to gross profit be so front and center here. Commodities can have a good return, provided they utilize less resources than other product lines. So it's going to come from moving this company towards a simpler, less structured, more efficient and more accountable organization. And for the details, you're welcome in New York at the Sofitel Hotel on the morning of September 20.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","One thing we -- coming to the release this morning, there were 2 items that you called out as unusual that totaled $10.8 million. $3.5 million was on cost of sales, $7.3 million was on SG&A. And in the write-up, you said $5.5 million of that $10.8 million was a write-down in the other segment. But that leaves you with $5.3 million, and we have no idea how that would be split among the segments.","Carol P. Lowe","So -- yes. Chip, we may -- to do the math of that, we maybe ought to take it offline. With respect to the other segment, that write-down, it wasn't specific to the medical business. It was some R&D type product lines that the company had been testing for several years, and we just didn't feel like we were going to reach the growth or margin levels that we would find acceptable. So we had some asset investments that we wrote off, and that's the piece that you're seeing for the medical and other. But again, I'd like to reiterate, it has nothing to do with the medical business specifically [indiscernible]","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, most of that other is tied to, I guess, the -- both programs, the QIP and the Integration and Optimization Program. But as you take charges and then -- but you have a separate line for costs. And I understood that you would take the charge, and then the cost would not flow through the P&L since they're on the charges. Why would they be separate? I'm just curious. Is this because things come up that you incur on a current basis that aren't part of prior charges? Or maybe you could help us there.","Carol P. Lowe","Yes. Chip, I guess it's going to be a lot of detail to walk through all of the numbers, so maybe we would take that offline. But I guess, we're not -- I'm not sure I understand what you're saying about other versus the restructuring. We clearly call out what are the restructuring pieces and how they impact. We actually have a reconciliation within the attachments to the earnings release. And those Integration and Optimization Program and the Quality Improvement Program, they're not in other.","Jerome A. Peribere","Other -- you need to consider other is medical and new ventures type of things, and that's a kind of small potpourri of quite a few things.","Lori Chaitman","Chip, do you have another question related to something else?","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So as you mentioned, sort of, interest expense looks like it's going down, which is great as we -- based on your full year guidance. And as you pay off debt in 2014 and '15, how should we think about that going down? In other words, do you have higher-cost debt you can buy in or call in? Or would it tend to be short-term debt that isn't as costly?","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. So we do have some higher-cost debt that will mature in February of next year. That's the 12% debt. It's $150 million. So we will be paying that off. And so we'll address that. In terms of looking at the balance of our debt, the next maturity that we would have after that is $8 million in an 8% senior note that's due in September 2019. Their first call date is September 2015. In addition, we've got our Term Loan B, which has a final maturity October 2018. Its current balance is about -- almost $800 million. It's got a 101 soft call, and it expires in November -- that soft call expires in November. So we have some opportunities to look at our total capital structure, and we'll do that as it best suits the cost structure for the company.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just 2 questions. First off, you had indicated that in some cases, on the Protective Packaging side, you were walking away from business and\/or customers just weren't willing to pay, so they essentially were walking away. I guess, in -- my question is on the pricing negotiations that you had in the food packaging portion of the business. Have you seen any similar movements from customers where that business has, just because of an unwillingness to meet your pricing, has just walked away? Or is that not the case yet?","Jerome A. Peribere","No. The nature of those 2 businesses are very, very different. You -- we have -- we gain and lose for customers much more easily in Protective Packaging compared to Food & Beverage businesses because there is, in some cases, a lot of technology in our food packaging business, et cetera. As I said before, some of our businesses in food packaging are in formula. Some others are in strict negotiations. We are, by far, the technology leader in food packaging. We are, by far, the big dog in the protective packaging industry. We are not having highly tense conversations. It's not always about just price. It is about the value that you create to your customers. So when we tell our customers that next round, when their business is going to continue growing, they will ask for new volume and additional volume and that when we run at capacity, we are not going to be able to supply them because we don't have reinvestment economics, they understand. They don't like it, but they understand. It is about this equation of cost competitiveness and performance, and so we need price increases. We have had our food packaging business, which has had -- which was, 10 years ago, much higher quality than it is today. It has constantly been going down, and that is not acceptable. So we need to have this partnership dialogue with our customers, and we do have that, and they understand. So that's what's going on. Plus, we have some incredibly innovative products. I mentioned some, the Simple Steps, the Oven Ease, the -- et cetera, et cetera, our products that create a lot of value to our customers.","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions. Mr. Peribere, I will now turn the conference back over to you for any additional closing remarks.","Jerome A. Peribere","So -- well, let me thank you all for your participation on the call today. The confidence that our plan to improve Sealed Air quality of earnings is underway, is there. We have people who are really pleased with the progress we have in this company. We are -- our employee force is highly motivated. They're seeing that we have a project. They are adhering to this project, and they are proud of what we're doing. That is the cement, that is the foundation of our future success.","Our second quarter performance is also a true testament to our leadership team and all of our employees and their commitment to continue progressing. The second half is -- we have given you a guidance in there, and it is a reasonable guidance given the external factors that are impacting our business. Latin Europe is problematic. They -- our sales have suffered, and we should not hide ourselves that it is going to be many years before the EU-27 countries will have a 2% GDP growth. It's not there. It's far from there, and it is disappointing, but it is the reality.","We have suffered from major currency devaluations in Latin America. The real is at about BRL 2.28, BRL 2.29 today, and it was at BRL 2.04 at the beginning of last quarter -- of this -- yes, of second quarter. The Argentinian peso has also dramatically devaluated. We're seeing decelerating growth -- nice growth but decelerating growth trends in China.","But despite those macroeconomics, there is a very clear direction for our business. We have pricing discipline, which is beginning to gain traction. We are pleased with this, very pleased with the momentum, internal momentum and understanding from our people and with some of our customers' reactions that I already talked to you about. We focus on providing significant value and innovative solutions to our customers, and we're becoming more nimble. So therefore, we are creating a better way for life, which is the vision of Sealed Air.","Thank you very much. Have a great day. Goodbye.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."],"18710":["Sealed Air (NYSE:SEE) Q1 2013 Earnings Call May  1, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Bill Thomas","Jerome A.

This call is being recorded. Leading the call today, Jerome A. Peribere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol P. Lowe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator Instructions]","And now, at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Thomas, Assistant Treasurer and Interim Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Thomas.","Bill Thomas","01","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion today. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at www.sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed on our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find on our website at www.sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.","Please note that we will end the call by noon today with Q&A wrapping up by 11:55 a.m.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Bill. Good morning. A pleasure to talk to you about our first quarter results, and let me just go ahead and summarize by saying, I believe we had a good quarter. Actually, a very good -- a very good quarter. Not so much because of the financials, which are in line with our expectations for the first quarter and in line with our guidance for the full year in terms of EBITDA, of improved cash flow in the first quarter compared to what we did last year, et cetera, but because we have made superb improvements in setting the stage for the new Sealed Air.","We have created a new vision, a new mission, new core values, which will be introduced in detail in our September -- at our September investor meeting. They are key to clarifying who we are and confirm why we exist. And they're based on 3 pillars: Performance, sustainability and cost-competitiveness. Our employees are on fire. They breathe a new extraordinary energy in this company. We polled our 25,000 employees to a survey during the first quarter. We took the pulse, and this allowed us to create employee engagement and alignment, which obviously will be pursued. I'm committed to make Sealed Air a thriving place to work, including to the future development of increase in performance compensation -- in performance-based compensation, alignment of equity among our heritage companies and increased transparency.","We have started to better align our innovation through an intense dialogue with our key partners and customers, and in order to improve, also, our return on our R&D dollars. We have and will continue to recruit externally or internally, high, very high-caliber talent as we did in January with our President of Institutional & Laundry; in April, with our new General Counsel; and soon, with a new CTO and a Communications VP. And we are building a more streamlined, efficient, accountable organization as a result of an announcement that I will make in a few minutes. This was a very busy quarter.","And now, let me just go into the numbers. Despite strong economic challenges in our developed market, especially in Europe, we finished the quarter with an improved month in our total operating results. Excluding the impact of the legacy Diversey stock appreciation rights, or what is referred to as SARs, our adjusted EBITDA and our margin have improved. While it's a small step, it is one in the right direction.","As highlighted on Slide 2 of our presentation, sales for the quarter were up 0.4% on 1% higher volume and 2% price mix, offset by 0.8% of unfavorable foreign exchange translation. We continue to achieve growth in developing regions, especially Latin America, where we achieved 12% growth in constant dollar, and Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, with an 8% constant dollar sales growth.","The increase was achieved in the face of continuing challenges, particularly in Southern Europe, as well as sporting [ph] supply challenges in North America and Europe. Sales in Europe actually declined approximately 3% on a reported and constant basis for the quarter, while North American sales were about flat with last year.","Our adjusted EBITDA was flat for the quarter versus prior year, if you include the $18 million of expense from SARs. SARs expenses were $12 million last year in the first quarter. And our exposure to SARs expense is a function of the value of our share price, and since our share price increased during the first quarter, our SARs expense increased as well. Excluding the impact of SARs, though, first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $245 million or 13.2% of sales as compared to $240 million or 13% of sales for the first quarter of last year. We continue to achieve positive momentum across a number of key metrics. We're achieving net sales growth with geographic expansion, developing new and expanded customer relationship, and demonstrating the strength and the breadth of our sustainability value proposition to customers. We continue to recognize strong cost synergies. For the quarter, we benefited from $29 million in incremental cost synergies under our 2011, 2014 integration and optimization program compared with the first quarter of 2012. These synergies resulted from a mix of headcount reductions, elimination of redundant cost, plant consolidations, and procurement and logistics savings.","If you move to Slide 3, our 62-country footprint continues to provide us with leading reach and great opportunity for international growth, better than our peers and where we -- and in fact, we're selling to 175 countries globally. And here, we have the tale of 2 worlds. In Western Europe, we had very bad growth with -- Western Europe has been very bad for us, led by France where our sales have gone down 10%. And you probably have noticed through economic information that France was the worst country in the first quarter out of the 4 largest West European countries. Spain was at minus 5%, but our sales have been stabilizing in Italy. North America was flat for us, but we have growth in I&L, Institutional & Laundry. Eastern Europe was very strong with double-digit growth in U.K. -- in Ukraine and Russia, for example. It was a little bit weak in Australia, weak in Japan because of devaluation, but very strong in Brazil; in Argentina, where we had double-digit growth in constant currencies; in Colombia; very strong also in AMAT with 13% growth in Turkey, 11% in China, India, Korea and so forth. So a tale of 2 worlds, very clearly, where we are continuing to do extremely well in emerging countries and where Western European countries, and especially Southern European countries, where we are very exposed, have been suffering very much from economic conditions.","And turning now onto Slide 4, and you'll see Food & Beverage sales have increased 1.9% on a constant dollar basis, with 2.4% organic growth in hygiene solutions and 1.7% in food packaging solutions. Our deployment of new products continues to add to our top line. In North America, our Grip & Tear, Darfresh, Oven Ease and Instapak products are value-added for the consumer and continued to gain share. Additionally, we are rolling out many of these products in Latin America now, and regionally, we experienced double-digit growth in AMAT and in Latin America, where our established footprint and strong market presence in Brazil enabled us to continue to benefit from rising beef production rates in that country. Protein supplies in North America had negatively impacted our year-on-year performance. Whereas the North American beef production declined 2.8% in the first quarter, following the 3.3% industry decline in Q4 of last year, our volumes to the U.S. fresh red meat sector declined by less than 1%, and we have pretty solid growth, non-U.S., with positive growth of 3.5%. We experienced strong equipment sales in Latin America and AMAT, but Southern Europe was a challenge due to the decline in protein supply and demand. F&B sales in France declined, for example, 9%. And sales to Spain were down 1%. The benefits of operating a global business were clearly demonstrated in the quarter as we achieved strong sales performance for fresh red meat applications in Latin America and Japan and Australia and New Zealand.","Central and Eastern Europe saw year-over-year growth improvements, particular in Russia, which contributed 9% organic growth. Overall, F&B adjusted EBITDA was 14.5%, or actually 15% if you exclude SARs, compared to 14.1%, or 14.4% if you exclude SARs, for the first quarter of 2012.","Adjusted EBITDA margin benefited from higher volumes, operational efficiencies and reduced expenses. And additionally, contractual pricing provisions in North America continued to cause us to lag raw material cost increases for some of our resins. And as a reminder, market prices for polyethylene in North America have increased 12% since January, which obviously takes a little bit of time to pass. And during our Q1, our F&B division implemented various pricing actions in response to these material cost increases, as well as rising inflation. The range of our announced price increases vary by country and by products, but we were not able to fully offset these increases during the first quarter, but expect to do so by the end of the second quarter as our contracts reset and announced price increases are fully implemented. Passthrough contracts are more commonly used in North America than in other regions, and we continue to pursue opportunities with our customers to shorten the reset period or lag time, especially in light of this kind of very steep polyolefin price increases that we suffer from. But we're also very pleased with our renewed discipline on price.","Moving on to Slide 5, that one highlights the result from our Institutional & Laundry division. As you know, I&L has the largest exposure to Europe of any of our divisions, with almost half of its sales generated in Europe. Obviously, the economic situation in Europe, particularly Southern Europe where we are fairly exposed, is offsetting the good news that we have in other parts of the world. As a whole, sales to Southern Europe were down 8%. Specifically, sales in Spain and France were both down 11%, with sales to Italy down by 10%. And sales growth was most significant in Latin America, with strong organic growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. AMAT, particularly China and India, had double-digit organic growth in sales during the quarter. Volumes in North America also increased 2.5%. Flow care machines sales were weak, mainly in Europe, which accounts -- and heavily weaker, which accounts for 2\/3 of global decline machine sales as customers, particular in the public sector, continue to very carefully manage their cash spend. Nevertheless, the sales decline in the machine sector represents an improvement over the global 5% decline that we witnessed in 2012.","Adjusted EBITDA was challenged due to sales expenses, but also was impacted by negative customer mix, inflationary costs and the timing of certain expenses, which I'm not going to detail in here. During the first quarter, I&L implemented price increase in most of their geographies. These increases reflect the combination of lease price increases and, where relevant, also, specific customer-by-customer increases, generating a positive price cost spread in the quarter.","Moving now to Protective Packaging on Slide 6, where we show sales that declined by 0.8% on a constant dollar basis with essentially flat volumes, offset by lower price\/mix and unfavorable currency translation. The unfavorable price\/mix is, in fact, attributable to increased sales to consumer-based customers, as well as reduced sales from -- of specialty foam products and the governmental projects. And the weakness in the industrial sector, because of industrial GDP lack of growth, is very obvious through our product mix. We had -- our cushioning business went down 3%. Our shrink business, which is partly consumer goods, went down 1%, but our packaging systems, which is more attributable to our e-commerce business, has been up by 5%. So net sales for e-commerce and third-party logistics providers continue to grow very nicely, but were offset, as I said, by the global manufacturing weakness, and again, once again, weak sales in Europe at minus 4%. And North America was slightly positive at over 1%, plus 1%. And in the end, adjusted EBITDA was 4.6% lower and was impacted by unfavorable customer mix and an unfavorable price cost spread. And during this first quarter, Protective Packaging, like our other businesses, announced price increases. Although some price increases were effective late in the first quarter, the majority took effect on April 1 because quite a lot of those -- our sales in Protective Packaging are going through distribution. And it takes quite a lot of time to be able to have all the SKUs from our sales and from the sales in the systems of our customers' distributors to be effective and implemented.","So we anticipate positive price cost spreads for the remainder of 2013, despite some recent information that some competitors have been rescinding some of their original moves as they are trying to push volume.","And now, turning to Slide 7. And as I have been communicating since joining Sealed Air, we are committed to margin improvement and alignment of our cost structure. We have identified opportunities all -- across all of our divisions, as well as in our corporate functions. As a result, we are announcing our new earnings quality improvement program through which we expect to obtain annual savings of $80 million by the end of '15. Cumulative costs for the program are estimated in the range of about $180 million to $200 million, and this program will implement much of the delayering I've been speaking about, resulting in a leaner organization structure, better-aligned, more accountable to serve our customers and improve our earnings over time. The savings under this program will be minimal for 2013 and are incremental to the cost synergies under the 2011, 2014 integration and optimization program.","And finally, I'd like to note that we have set a date for our 2013 Investor Day. It will be on September 20 in New York City. And the Sealed Air leadership team will present to you a review of each of our divisions, provide a 3-year forecast and provide details on our strategic priorities and our long-term target. We will share additional details on location and timing as we get closer to the event.","And now, I will turn the call over to Carol Lowe to discuss the first quarter financial results in more detail and highlight our outlook for the remainder of 2013. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. If you are following along with your presentation, Slide 8 provides a bridge for the change in our net sales from the first quarter 2012 to 2013.","Volumes contributed $19 million year-over-year, with a small positive price\/mix from Food & Beverage and Institutional & Laundry, partially offset by unfavorable price\/mix for Protective Packaging. Overall, our price\/mix was $3 million positive. Currency translation was $14 million unfavorable, primarily driven by declines in Latin American currency.","Moving to Slide 9, this reflects the adjusted EBITDA bridge from the first quarter 2012 to 2013. As Jerome discussed, we benefited from $29 million in incremental cost synergies during the first quarter of 2013. Volume contributed $7 million to EBITDA. SG&A costs were $17 million unfavorable year-over-year on increased compensation and benefit cost, cost to support growth in developing regions and new business, as well as the timing impact of certain expenses that were different than 2012. As we noted on the Q4 earnings call, the full year effect of compensation and benefit increases is approximately $55 million to $60 million. Highlighting once again, the SARs expense was $18 million during Q1, or $6 million higher versus Q1 2012. While the amount of the SARs expense is not linear, and as most of you know, Black-Scholes is complicated, a change in the value of Sealed Air stock price based on the current amount of SARs outstanding, we estimate that for every $1 change in our stock price, it impacts EBITDA by approximately $2.5 million. As of mid-April, we had approximately $2.4 million in SARs outstanding in terms of the number of SARs.","Now turning to Slide 10, please note that the first quarter is our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter. Free cash flow was the use of $65 million in Q1 2013. This is a very meaningful improvement over a use of $125 million in the first quarter of 2012. The $60 million improvement was due to higher net earnings and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by a decrease in receivables. The company has set several metrics around improvement and working capital. Our supply chain team has been making excellent progress in the management of our supplier payment terms. In addition to Q1 being a seasonally low cash flow quarter, we typically use cash during the first half of the year. Most of our cash flow's generated during the last half of the year.","During Q1, we make certain onetime annual payments, such as annual incentive compensation awards. We also pay semiannual interest on our 2 largest bonds and have a seasonal inventory build. As stated during our Q4 earnings call, we have programs in place to achieve working capital improvements in 2013 as part of our continued disciplined cash flow management focus with reduced leverage as a key use for our cash.","Moving on to Slide 11, cash and cash equivalents were $626 million at March 31. As of March 31, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.5 billion. Our net debt was $4.9 billion at the end of March, an increase of approximately $92 million mainly due to the seasonal cash flow needs I previously discussed. During Q1, we purchased our 7 7\/8 senior notes, due 2017. We were able to repurchase them with the proceeds of our new 5 1\/4 10-year senior notes. We have a manageable debt maturity schedule, and we will continue to look to the market to opportunistically extend our maturities and\/or reduce our interest rates. We continue to plan to use our excess cash flow to reduce our debt, pay our dividend and prudently invest in the business via a disciplined expenditure process.","Slide 12 highlights our outlook for the remainder of 2013. We are maintaining our full-year net sales to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion, also in line with our prior guidance. Finally, we continue to forecast adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.10 to $1.20. As a result of the cash cost associated with the earning quality improvement program Jerome discussed, we are estimating our full-year free cash flow will now be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, which compares with $280 million for the year ended 2012.","Cost reduction benefits under this new program will be minimal for 2013. We are continuing with the review of our portfolio and we'll monetize nonstrategic assets to fund our restructuring programs so not to negatively impact our ability to reduce our leverage. The first quarter of 2013 benefited from a core tax rate of 19.4%, which compares with 22.3% for the first quarter of 2012. This represents approximately a $0.01 favorable impact year-over-year. We benefited in the U.S. from the retroactive extension by Congress of certain items, including the R&D benefit. We expect our core tax rate to be between 25% and 26% for the full year. Interest expense for 2013 is expected to be approximately $355 million, which includes approximately $290 million of cash interest expense.","Before turning the call back to Jerome to lead the Q&A, I would like to note that we have included in the appendix of the presentation a summary of our first quarter adjusted earnings per share calculations for your reference. We believe you'll find this schedule useful as you update your models to walk from adjusted EBITDA to adjusted earnings per share.","Jerome, I'll now turn the call back to you for Q&A.","Jerome A. Peribere","Okay. Well, thank you, Carol. Operator, I'd like to open the call up to any questions from the participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is on pricing. Could you provide, perhaps, a bit more granularity on what you expect to achieve in net price cost in the second quarter, and -- considering the challenges that you have in I&L from a European standpoint on the volume side and the fact that it looks like at least the market factors are making a little bit more difficult in Protective Packaging to put through pricing? And then I had a follow-on.","Jerome A. Peribere","Sure. So, George, thank you for your question. The 12% Q1 polyolefin cost increase is not a small amount. And what we have been doing is, to recreate energy and focus onto our sales force, we have -- we're separating the function of sales from marketing and we're forcing a very much more diligent approach to our pricing. We need to get that done, you heard me say that, and I'm going to continue and I'm very strong within the company in doing this. So then you look at our customer mix and you look at it as a result of the businesses in which we are. Protective Packaging, as I said in my prepared remarks, are about distribution. There are lots, lots, lots of SKUs, and as a result of that, it takes a little bit of more time. But this is why we haven't announced -- we have announced our price increases, but they have been implemented late in the Q -- in the first quarter and most of them going to in Q1 -- in April 1. In Q2 -- and then F&B is a different story, bigger customers, and we have been making better inroads with regards to implementing what we needed to implement. Actually, I can see that right now in the gross profit to net sales. Let me give you 2 numbers. In F&B for the quarter, our gross profit to net sales improved by 20 basis points. But in March, our net profit -- our gross profit to net sales improved by 80 basis points. So it should tell you something. I'm not saying the whole thing is by definition pricing, but it is also pricing. On Protective Packaging, we have a lag for the reasons I've told you. We lost 40 basis points for the quarter, but in March, we lost less than 30 basis points for the month of March. So here again, I don't want to mislead anybody, but it is also about our pricing being implemented and being successful. We need to get that, the demand is not there, but the ethylene cycle is there. And therefore, I want to have our people very conscious of this because even if situations improve on a given month, the trend is not going to be a positive one until new big ethylene -- polyethylene capacities come to the marketplace, and we know when they're going to come, and therefore, we are, in the meantime, being diligent about those things. So clearly, to your question, a new mindset and when do I expect this to happen, I'm expecting to recover everything and more by the end of the second quarter.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, appreciate the color in that, Jerome. Second question I had, and I'll turn it over obviously, switching gears to I&L. Can you comment to the degree to which you're being able to service some of the new awards you've received, given that you may have some difference in the way that you go to market and service customers versus some of your more substantial competitors, especially in light of the fact that we are obviously going to see more cost reductions within the business and within I&L, even though some of that's probably more centered in Europe? Help us understand your progress there.","Jerome A. Peribere","So you've got large contracts and you've got smaller contracts there. For the larger contracts, so we, in the places where we don't have critical mass, we are selectively hiring to serve the customers, and we're making pretty good progress in serving and converting those contracts there. That's work in progress. There is in this industry, a new word, which I have learned because I didn't know it existed. Those are called freebate. I didn't know what that meant until I have been told that they were invented by this industry and this is -- I'm not going to comment on this, but this is crazy. But that's the way it is. So in terms of accretion to sales, we're not seeing them -- or to our business or our results -- in fact, we're not seeing that right now in Q1 and Q2. It's going to take a little bit of time. But the rollover and the change and the account-by-account is coming, and I'm getting monthly reports on how this is progressing and it is progressing according to our targets. So things are fine in there. It's not a question of region.","As I said, we pragmatically, selectively deploy manpower when we have to deploy manpower. But there are 2 trends again. We are going to staff appropriately the way we need to in the places where we're growing. And I gave you examples of where we're growing, and we are doing absolutely fabulous in the regions where you would expect that we're doing fabulous, except that we also are doing pretty nice in -- and renewing with growth which didn't happen for a long time in the heritage Diversey, renewing with growth in the U.S. We had 2% -- over 2% growth in this quarter and this is serving us well. But we are double digits in Eastern European countries. We are growing very nicely, over 15% -- actually, 17% in China, 13% in India, in the currency as the same -- apples-with-apples with last year. We're growing in Turkey, very nicely. We're growing very well in Latin America, and you can guess that we are staffing properly in those regions. Unfortunately, more than -- almost half of our sales are in Western Europe, and that's life. So there, the industry is in very bad shape and we are, right now, suffering a little bit from some contracts which got lost under the previous administration. I can assure you that I am absolutely very, very pleased with the leadership, new leadership in that division and with the renewed energy and what we are going to be doing with the announcement of the plan that I have talked to you a few minutes ago and detailed by Carol; we are going to simplify this organization. We're going to de-lever this organization. We're going to make it more cost-efficient.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Punjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the management de-levering, as you put it, can you guys give us a rough sense as to how that breaks down geographically? And is it scaled generally by the size of the business or is it more concentrated? And, Carol, is the $65 million cash cost for the entirety of the program or just in 2013?","Carol P. Lowe","So Ghansham, in terms of breaking down, I'll provide a little more color. We're going to be a bit sensitive in terms of where some of the costs are going to be because obviously, a meaningful portion is related to severance costs. We estimate approximately 400 to 500 reduction in employees that is contained in that total program. The $65 million is related to 2013. The remaining $135 million, we would expect approximately $100 million of that to be incurred in 2014. I'll also note that the spend -- and we highlighted this in the 8-K that was filed today, includes -- the $180 million to $200 million includes $55 million to $70 million for capital expenditures associated with our supply chain network realignment to support our long-term strategic plan. We would expect, and this is included in the $65 million, somewhere around $10 million to $12 million for CapEx in 2013, and approximately $30 million to $35 million CapEx in 2014, with the remainder of it in the conclusion of the program. A larger portion will, in fact, be in Europe, as everyone would expect. Both the Food & Beverage and Institutional & Laundry businesses have a meaningful portion of the total program. I would say it's a little heavier for I&L than it is for F&B. So hopefully, that provides you some additional color.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, it's certainly helpful. And then, Jerome, as you think about various other cost buckets, how do you feel about your manufacturing capacity footprint globally as you look across the different businesses?","Jerome A. Peribere","Very different, Ghansham, business-by-business. We are rationalizing in this program. We're going to be rationalizing also our footprint in some European countries, and especially some -- are tend to be global plant like -- or not, if not global, very large plants like in F&B. Some others would tend to be local plants because of the value add of less -- -- of more commoditized Protective Packaging products, for example. Though in some markets where we believe that the recovery is not there and close to come -- and I'm referring to Southern Europe -- we're going to be rationalizing our capacity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I had a question on your cash flow guidance. When I think about the legacy Sealed Air generating $300 million, $400 million of cash, I guess my question is, do you expect the I&L business to generate cash in 2013? Is it cash neutral or is it cash-dilutive, given some of the problems you're having in Europe? Or is there a way that we can think about kind of the long-term cash generation power of I&L, given maybe we have a little bit better understanding of what the packaging business has historically done?","Carol P. Lowe","So I'll -- just -- and then if Jerome wants to add comments. Just generally, we don't break out our cash flow separate for each of the segments. Obviously, you can look at historically based on what Sealed Air generated in the past and note that the I&L business does not contribute as much from a cash flow standpoint with restructuring charges. That obviously impacts the free cash flow for I&L, as well as F&B. The other thing to keep in mind is, we also have a lot of interest expense that is driven by the acquisition that affects the company overall. As I referenced in my comment, we have $290 million in cash interest costs that we will incur in 2013. So that's a big impact versus what you would have historically seen more recently for the legacy Sealed Air business prior to the Diversey acquisition. But we obviously expect I&L to be positive from an EBITDA standpoint for the full year, and positive EBITDA is positive cash flow.","Jerome A. Peribere","But by definition, Anthony, to be generating a lot of cash, you need to generate a lot of profits. And it's no mystery that I was fairly dissatisfied with the profits profile of this division, and that's why there are lots of changes being implemented. So bear with us a little bit of time and you'll be satisfied.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. I mean, you have some regions where you're kind of contracting and you have some regions where you're seeing impressive growth. When I think about the full year CapEx guidance of $160 million, is that a decent benchmark maybe going into 2014 in terms of some of the capital needs you have to take to expand or could that go up or maybe comes off a bit?","Jerome A. Peribere","So we have set the bar fairly high for capital spending. We -- out of the $160 million at this minute, there is still some capital for IS [ph], and so as a result for restructuring and on the integration of companies. That's probably a number which is a little bit low, but it's all about prioritization. And the way I look at CapEx is that it is a resource similar to R&D. And if you ask me how do I look at R&D, I'm saying, probably a little bit too much, given our productivity at this minute. So -- and CapEx, probably a little bit too little given the opportunities that we have to expand in some parts of the world where -- and some product lines where -- which are going to be needing a little bit of capital. So if you take those 2 buckets as sources of -- as use of cash, I would suggest that those kind of things -- the sum of the 2 are probably not going to be growing very much next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the pricing actions that you're taking. You did mention that you're trying to offset the escalating raw materials costs. I guess my understanding was that most of these raws were already on passthrough mechanisms. So my first question is, can you just clarify on the passthrough mechanisms? And the second part of the question is really around, when do we -- do we need raw material prices to be flat in order to get real pricing for the value that you add for your customers? And also, if it's just based off of raw material prices, do we then end up giving some of that back when raw materials start to decline?","Jerome A. Peribere","So first of all, with regards to our contracts, in North America, there are more contracts which have an escalator depending on raw materials, and then there is some which have a lag of several months. Some of too many months and some appropriately, but I don't think it is healthy to have contracts which have too much of a lag time. I do understand why they were there, but I'm not satisfied with those kinds of things. So this is one kind of situation. But some of the contracts, mostly in North America and some other parts of the world, it's a negotiation. And therefore, not automatically, but we're working -- I can assure you that we're making a lot of progress in there. Then the second is, okay, so you pass your costs. Is that where your ambition lies? And my ambition doesn't lie there. My ambition is twofold. One is to get that done by definition, what I was talking about, passing that by definition. Second is to get value for what we do and better value for what -- for the differentiation we create. Every single company has commodities and specialties. Every single company has products on which they fight on price on a daily basis and some others in which they need to find better on the value that they'll be creating. And in one of our core values, which is called purposeful innovation, and the word is the following, is, \"We delight our customers with revolutionary solutions which make them win, and we share the value that we have created.\" So it has several messages, #1 is that there is no room from me to innovation. We've got to really focus on real differentiated innovation. The second thing is that we have to ally with companies which look forward. Companies which really see that they need to differentiate or they need -- so if they differentiate, they have higher gross margins or if they can also differentiate by us enabling them to reduce their cost. But it can't be all for us because otherwise, they won't [ph] adopt those solutions or for them. So you can't -- you can't do those things with everybody. You've got to have cultural fit. And that -- these are the kind of discussions that I'm having with our customers. We are here to create value to them. We need to create value to us also. We have -- I'm deeply dissatisfied with our return on capital invested. I'm deeply dissatisfied with the technology that we have in relation to the margins, so we've got to -- we are working hard, and I can assure you that it resonates with some type of customers who really want us to help them differentiate. And that's where we're going to get the most value.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then the follow-up is just around, Carol, on the SARs expense, what's included in the guidance for the year, and then looking further out, when would we kind of expect these expenses to go away? Would the delayering in Europe help to reduce those costs in the future?","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. So in terms of -- if some of the 400 to 500 that I referenced as part of the restructuring program, obviously, if any of those individuals have SARs, what would -- potentially the effect for their holdings would go away as part of their severance package, if that, in fact, happened. In terms of -- as long as they're outstanding, there will be volatility because they move with the value of the share price. The vesting of the 2.4 million units that I referenced, it has approximately 12 months longer to run to be fully vested. But again, we will have that volatility as we move forward. So in terms of what's included in our guidance, I guess we have not broken that out in the past. We do have an estimate in terms of cash flow and how that's impacted the liability that we have on the books, is approximately $40 million related to our SARs, but we haven't broken out previously the impact in the next month.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with Keybanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One on cash flow, Carol. So you're planning to spend an additional $65 million on the cash restructuring compared to your previous guidance, but the range for the year only declined by $25 million so I'm just wondering what other moving parts are in there. Was working capital more beneficial than you expected or otherwise?","Carol P. Lowe","So, Adam, we're taking -- yes, we've made certain, I guess, assumptions relative to working capital, that it would be positive based on previous estimates that we had made and from a comparison standpoint. So if you look at our EBITDA, look at the midpoint of the guidance that we've provided and deduct from that, the cash interest of $290 million that I referenced, there's approximately $135 million for restructuring cash payments between the original integration and optimization program, as well as the $65 million for the new restructuring program, the $160 million for capital expenditures and then deferred taxes and potentially, what we may pay out in SARs. That would get you down to that new range that we're providing for the free cash flow, plus the improvement in working capital performance.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And, Jerome, one for you on pricing. How do you expect the nature and magnitude of your pricing initiatives to differ next year compared to this year?","Jerome A. Peribere","On -- as you heard me just say before to Scott, there was the 2 elements of this. Number one, the discipline, and I don't know; I don't want to anticipate what polyolefin or other related raw materials are going to be. And the other one, it is depending on our innovation and on our culture. I am expecting our people to be more forceful at getting value from the services that they provide today and don't get value on today. If you want one example, we're engineering plants for some of our customers because we are a big equipment manufacturer and seller. While there are -- one can pretend that engineering is included in some of the prices for our equipment for fumes, et cetera, et cetera, or not. But I want a more rigorous approach. Again, this company can do better. That's my view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So first question, Carol, you talked about potentially monetizing nonstrategic assets. Obviously, you had the Diversey Japan transaction, but just wondering how you're thinking about that. Is the target still $500 million or, as a result of this increased restructuring program, might you guys get more aggressive on this front?","Carol P. Lowe","So the -- we have not set any new target, Phil. Previous communication was that it could be up to $500 million as we continue to look at the assets, the portfolios, different regions. We'll review that number as we go forward. We've also been very clear that we're not looking to have a fire sale on anything. We want to approach this very disciplined and we have to get the right valuation. But I guess the message we want everyone to take away today is that we are committed to reducing the leverage for the company and we're going to be very prudent in terms of making sure we can fund these restructuring programs, and we'll look to move forward on certain assets. But I guess I wouldn't feel comfortable targeting a certain amount right now because we also -- we're not going to walk away from something that's adding value to the business if we can't get the right valuation for it. We will then look to potentially slow down the timing of some of the cash outflow relative to the restructuring cost to make sure we have a proper balance.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just 1 follow-up question on pricing. Sorry if we're beating a dead horse here, but I guess, just asking a slightly different way, to what extent does the competitive response kind of impact, Jerome, how you might think about the pricing initiatives? You gave the example of Protective, so just more broadly, if you were to start to see that in other areas, between pricing versus restructuring, et cetera, maybe just how you think about that.","Jerome A. Peribere","The way I think about that is that I don't care very much what our competitors are doing. The reason why I'm saying this is that, as I said before, there are some product lines of which I am deeply dissatisfied with the return on capital invested. Those don't return capital. If our competitors want to destroy economic value, that's their problem; no problem for me. What I want is that we, in a disciplined way, move to the targets that we have. And they include getting a proper return on capital investment on some of that. So in some product lines, we are seeing that we're alone. Fine. At the end of the day, a product line which has a low EBITDA, it has a low EBITDA because we haven't done our homework, because it has commoditized, et cetera, et cetera, or -- well, it's either\/or. And \"we haven't done our homework\" means -- can be on differentiation, can be on being forceful, not forceful enough on our pricing discipline, et cetera, or because it's a dud. Well, in that case, you select the type of customers you want to work with, you select those who value your differentiation, your brand, your portfolio, et cetera, and then fine. And those who just go for volume, well, let them go for volume. I -- this company is more focused than it was in the past on value versus volume. And I don't want to make it into an obsession, I probably have talked much too much about all of this, but this is internally, a very clear message.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jerome, I know you've been digging through the packaging businesses for a while now just to kind of figure out where the real value is. Can you give us your thoughts on how much of your packaging-related portfolio is either truly specialty or has kind of a lock and key type system to it, and how much of it might be viewed as more commodity?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, again, you've got to look at this division by division. And in some of our divisions, the name is a warranty for a certain quality. If I would take our most iconic brand, which is Bubble Wrap, you can have plastics encapsulated bubbles -- or bubbles encapsulated in plastics films, et cetera, from wherever you want. And our people have led me to understand that bubble wrap is not Bubble Wrap. That you've got Bubble Wrap and that you've got generic Bubble Wrap and that you can't compare because they deflate, they do this, they do this, et cetera, et cetera. So some products are heavily commoditized. Some others, not. Some product lines, people think that they are but they're not. In some, the brand equity is very large. So I can't embark into taking a one-on-one every single division and every single product line and tell you this is a commodity because there are shades of gray. You have products which are clear commodities. I would call synth foam [ph] a clear commodity. And then next to that, you have products which are -- which still have brand equity but are less differentiated than they were in the past. And then you have some products, which are clearly second to none, and they are unmatched. We are growing the category in Food Packaging, we have lots of those things in Protective Packaging. We have some Fill-Air lines and in shrink packaging, we have an extraordinary differentiated product which is making a killing right now. And our shrink film business has been a commodity business and is going to move, I can assure you, over the next 3 years into a very strong specialty. And the value proposition that we bring to our customers here is that we are having 25% to 50% less gauge at equal performance and equal clarity. So these are the kind of shrink film for consumer goods. You take 2 bottles of shampoo then bundle them in their shrink film, and I can assure you that there is a lot of value for our customers and a lot of value for ourselves.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. Just one last question. In I&L, you announced a pretty big contract win last quarter. Are you fully staffed for the service needed on those contracts yet or is there still more kind of cost to be laid in just to at least meet that contract, specifically?","Jerome A. Peribere","We are, and I don't know -- we have hired a few people here and there, but I don't know whether we have hired everyone we wanted to hire by now, et cetera. Those kind of contracts are ramp-up phasing -- on a ramp-up phase; they take a little bit of time to implement. And as a result of that, it's work in progress. But as I said earlier, I am satisfied, I'm following that up closely, just like you can imagine that I'm following up the win and the losses here and there. I'm satisfied with the ratio and -- but I'm very dissatisfied with what's happening in Western Europe and our exposure to Southern Europe. I do understand what's going on. I am dissatisfied because I would like to have better growth. We're having fabulous growth in some places but -- and not in Southern Europe as a result of some heritage business losses, which I can assure you would not happen today. And also, because the market sucks in some of those countries. As a Frenchman, I can tell you, I'm very concerned about the French economy. It's been moving towards Spain and Italy instead of moving towards Germany. And it shows in our equipment business, equipment and tools business. People who can make their big tacky machine run a little bit longer, they're just going to do it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I know Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter for you for I&L. I just want to get a sense, going forward for better pricing, how should we think about the profitability of this business from a cadence standpoint in the next few quarters?","Jerome A. Peribere","A work in progress. It is a -- those things don't get turned around on a quarterly basis. What I can assure you is that there is a lot of energy, a lot of energy in this business. We have growth in our 2013 plan and we're going to make it happen, and I'm very encouraged by some of those things, and I'm not going to come back on what I've just said a second ago, but I do not expect much improvement in Western Europe in the very short term. Having said that, we're having some fabulous success stories here and there in some emerging markets and we're seeing growth in North America, which was not the case 12 months ago. So all of this is moving in the right direction. And I know that with what we're doing, it's going to get better. Give me a little bit of time. Give Ilham a little bit of time.","Philip Ng - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then, I guess, a question for Carol. What's the long-term net leverage target, including price, that you're talking about over long-term before -- the focus is obviously debt pay-down now, but what's the target you want reached before -- would open the door for you to be a bit more strategic on the cash flow?","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. So what we communicated is we definitely want to get under 4x. We're going to take a step back and look at what's going on from a macroeconomic standpoint, where we're at with cash flow generation, what are the strategic priorities of the company, but definitely, some -- moving towards that 3.5x to 4x and then reassessing. We want to make sure we're always prudent in our capital management for the company. So it will be fluid, but you can rest assured there is a commitment from this management team to reduce the leverage.","Jerome A. Peribere","#1, #2, #3 priority is to de-leverage this company. And that's going to keep us busy for the next 12 months. And then depending on the world economy, we're going to be satisfied with a given ratio, which is going to be a higher ratio if the economy looks really on the right track, and we're going to keep on if it really looks iffy.","Operator","And this is all the time we have for questions. Mr. Peribere, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional closing remarks.","Jerome A. Peribere","All right. Well, thank you all for your questions, and thank you for being here with us in announcing these first quarter results. In closing, as we have communicated, the process of transforming Sealed Air is going to take time, but I am pleased with what I said. I started this call by telling you some of all the very great things that we're doing. We're doing many, many, many things at the very same time, and actually, I am proud of the energy that I'm seeing from our leadership, but also from all of our employees who are seeing this project and believe in that project. So this is great. We have a clear direction and we have -- are determined to see the stop of the declining margins this year and starting to grow it again. To our new earnings quality improvement program that we have announced, we'll begin the alignment of our cost structure and footprint with the growth and profit strategy of the company. And we are in the process of becoming a more nimble, focused company that delights our customers. This is why we exist. And I look forward to leading our employees who are creating a better way for life, which is our new vision, while providing value to our shareholders. Thank you very much. Have a good day. We'll have another earnings call before our Investor Day on September 20, and I look forward to being able to explain to you and show you our senior management in action, talking to you about our midterm strategy on September 20. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

This call is being recorded. Leading the call today we have William V. Hickey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jerome A. Peribere, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Carol P. Lowe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After management's prepared comments, they will be taking questions. [Operator Instructions]","And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Amanda Butler, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Butler.","Amanda H. Butler","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we've provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast, as well it can also be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are made solely on information that is now available to us. And we encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release, which are provided with this call.","Additionally, our future performance may be different due to a number of factors and many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can find also on our website at sealedair.com. We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we've included in our earnings release. Lastly, we have used pro forma results for certain metrics in the quarter to aid in the comparison of our performance to historical combining metrics of Sealed Air and Diversey. These pro forma results are available as supplements on our website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Bill Hickey. Bill?","William V. Hickey","Thank you, Amanda, and good morning to everyone. Before we begin our discussion on the quarter, I would like to really thank everyone for their flexibility in participating in our call today, which as you know, is outside of our normally scheduled date and time. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy and the aftermath that has disrupted a lot of people around the New York metro area, we felt it was prudent to delay the release and earnings call for everyone's safety.","Additionally, it is with great pleasure that I welcome and introduce Jerome Peribere, as Sealed Air's new President and Chief Operating Officer. As we previously announced, Jerome will succeed me as Sealed Air's Chief Executive Officer in March of next year. Jerome brings to us a wealth of international experience gained from 35 years at the Dow Chemical Company. He has significant global experience, which is particularly important to Sealed Air today, where we have 60-plus percent of our business outside the United States.","Interesting, he also brings packaging experience as his first job at Dow Chemical in France was selling Ethafoam polyethylene foam, which is one of the products that we still sell today. And most importantly, he brings recent acquisition-integration experience from Dow's Rohm and Haas acquisition where he led the integration of Rohm and Haas into the Dow Chemical Company. Jerome has been a quick understudy and in his first 2 months, he has met our key managers, met with employees on 3 continents and met with numerous customers of our food, protective and Diversey businesses. He's off to a great start.","On today's call, I will give a few opening comments, then Jerome will highlight our business unit performance. Carol Lowe, our CFO, will follow with a more detailed discussion on our consolidated results, liquidity, other key matters outlined in our press release as well as our updated guidance.","Following our prepared remarks, we will provide time for your questions. I plan to have Jerome and Carol address your questions. But of course, I will be available as needed. As a reminder, all of our results outlined here today reflect the announced sale of Diversey Japan and its classification as a discontinued operation.","Getting started on Slide 2 of our presentation. The third quarter paced well with our assumptions and guidance for the second half of the year, despite uneven recovery in our end markets and a fair amount of caution expressed by our consumers and our customers during the quarter. We stayed focused on the goals we established at the beginning of this year: integrating Diversey; generating our synergies; and accelerating our growth programs to increase market presence, EBITDA and free cash flow. We did a solid job in the third quarter, which I will dive into a bit more in the next slide.","We improved our profitability performance significantly over the second quarter, giving us good momentum going into the fourth quarter. I do want to point out that our Food Packaging business operating margin recovered in the third quarter and improved 390 basis points by restarting up our production at our new plant in Brazil. As we indicated earlier, during the second quarter, we shut down one of the production lines in Brazil to move it to our new facility, 120 kilometers away. As a result of higher-than-projected customer demand, we had to import products from the U.S. at a high freight and duty cost to continue to supply customers.","I am pleased to tell you that last week when Jerome and I were in Brazil, I saw the production line installed and running salable product. Imports have stopped, and you can see the effect in our third quarter operating results.","Additionally, early this week, we announced the sale of Diversey Japan, an asset that was identified as part of our strategic review, and we expect to close that transaction in the fourth quarter. We plan to use the net proceeds to prepay debt, which will enable us to exceed our 2012 net debt goal of $4.95 billion.","Strategically this allows us to invest in higher growth areas such as Asia and Latin America, where we're making strong inroads with Diversey constant dollar sales growth rates in those 2 areas at 13% and 9%, respectively.","Let's move to Slide 3. You will see a snapshot of our consolidated trends. And you can see how we've achieved good year-over-year and sequential momentum across a number of key metrics, including sales, profitability, margins and synergies. We continue to make strong inroads toward meeting our strategic objectives: achieving net sales gains through [indiscernible] graphic expansion, achieving sales gains through ongoing and adoption of our new inventive solutions, sales gains through incremental $10 million of annualized synergy sales and sales gains through new customer wins around the world. Our profitability metrics improved on greater operational execution, lower raw material cost, increasing cost, synergy benefits and seasonality.","If I move to Slide 4, although Jerome and Carol will provide more detail into the components of these results, I will highlight the growth we have achieved leveraging our extensive 62-country footprint, which continues to give us leading reach and greater opportunity for international growth than our peers.","Looking at the map on this Slide 4, you can see that we maintained or grew our organic growth rates in the third quarter compared with trending in the second quarter, largely led by unit volume growth in Food and Protective Packaging business and through solid price generation in our Diversey segment.","North America was the only exception, with a modest decline to steady year-over-year performance due to lower price\/mix in Protective Packaging. This lower price\/mix resulted from products mix shifts to more sustainable but more profitable film structures, which yielded improved margins for this segment. Of course, the key drivers of our momentum in the quarter came through solid execution among our businesses, which Jerome will now highlight. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. It's really great to be here with you today. As Bill mentioned, I'd like to start by discussing some of the key drivers we saw over the quarter and highlight a few areas I'm most excited about as I took the future of Sealed Air -- as I look at the future of Sealed Air.","Turning to Slide 5 first. The key takeaway for Food Packaging is that the business is back on track. This is most evidenced by how we reestablished our third quarter adjusted operating profit margin back to 13.6%. This compares to the 9.7% margin we reported in the second quarter.","So let's look first at the left side of the slide, and you'll see that a component of that margin improvement was volume growth. Food Packaging did a solid job, driving 2% volume growth in the quarter versus last year, with volumes up across all regions. Our growth was led by an 8% volume increase in Latin America, where our established footprint and strong market presence in Brazil allows us to benefit from the rising beef production rate in that country.","Additionally, we saw 2% higher volume in Europe, Middle East, Africa on the strength of new customer wins in the Middle East, strength in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as benefits from mix shifts in Western Europe that favors Food Packaging segment products. These areas of strength offset the weak North American protein industry, which continued to face supply constraints in the quarter, with weighted average industry production rate down 2% versus last year.","So I'm pleased to report that we try to evolve industry production rates. Generating this slight increase in volumes in North America, primarily from new customer wins and customer adoptions of new solution, like our Cryovac Multi-Seal FoldLOK reclosable package for retailized shredded cheese pack. This new solution has just rolled out and -- by a new specialty grocery retailer in the quarter and has triggered a second phase of development with a sponsor in cheese processor.","Innovation and new solutions are at the core of our competitive advantage and remain the key factor in our ability to face above-industry production rate, this is especially the case in Food Packaging, where 25% of our sales come from new solutions.","Looking now to the right of the Slide to profitability. Food Packaging margins were generally resilient year-over-year, but improved almost 400 points basis sequentially as we eliminated the unusual one item -- onetime item that we identified in the second quarter, and Bill mentioned -- made some comments a few minutes ago about that. And we significantly reduced our start-up cost in North America and Brazil related to facility consolidations, as he also did mention.","In Brazil, we accelerated this relocation, and we achieved altogether this move a few months ahead of schedule, which will benefit fourth quarter margin results.","Let's look at Food Solutions on Slide 6 now. Although many of our customers, especially in Europe and North America, are dealing with constrained protein supplies and price-sensitive consumers at retail, Food Solutions achieved 2% volume growth in the quarter, which outpaces protein industry production rate. Our volume performance was largely driven, in fact, by a 21% volume increase in our vertical pouch packaging solutions for fluid and semi-fluid product in North America, due to a record tomato crop this year and the right solutions to capitalize on these favorable trends.","And last but not least, I'd like to highlight which is the 10% increase in volumes in Latin America due to the strength of local protein production, as well as new customer wins. This solid volume performance, combined with our lower raw material cost and solid management of expenses, yielded a very strong 12.8% adjusted operating profit margin, which is up 170 basis points versus last year.","And now looking to the Protective Packaging segment on Slide 11. As you can see on the left of the slide, Protective is doing a good job at holding on its 0.4% volume growth rate, consistent with the second quarter trend. We achieved this despite a softening in the rate of global economic and ongoing weakness in Southern Europe and in China's export sector. A key area of growth for the business was the 20%-plus global volume increase in e-commerce and fulfillment-oriented applications that we issued globally. This strong growth rate reflects both the rising usage of e-commerce as well as customer wins in this sector. Additionally, Protective achieved a 2% volume growth in North America, reflecting modest growth in the industrial sector, as well as new customer wins in the region.","Europe, Middle East and Africa remains the weakest region for Protective, with 2% lower volume, largely offsetting some persistent weakness in Southern Europe as customers continue to reduce their production volumes. And despite the modest volume improvement overall and the lower price\/mix in the quarter, adjusted operating margin performance improved year-over-year and on a sequential basis, which you can see to the right of this slide, which reflects tight control of expenses and the benefit of our most sustainable film structures, which record less resin contents.","And finally, to the Diversey segment on Slide 8. Looking to the left of the slide, on a pro forma basis, this segment generated 2% higher organic sales from 2% higher price\/mix and a modest 0.5% decline in volumes. This volume performance is considerably improved compared to the negative 3% to 4% rate noted in prior quarters.","The key drivers for this improvement are 7% higher volume in developing regions, the apparent stabilization of demand in Northern Europe, which has 70% of Diversey's European mix revenue, net gains in new customers and the ongoing expansion adoption -- and adoption of best-in-class solutions, like our TASKI floor care equipment systems among new and existing customers.","As you can see by our slide, 2\/3 of Diversey's revenue increased on a year-over-year basis with food and beverage, distributors and lodging achieving over 4% organic growth. The areas of greatest weakness continued to persist in the same sector noted in prior quarters due to lower reorder rate or cautious allocation of capital investment in equipments due -- in equipment systems due to the economy. The key area of weakness unique to Diversey is the consumer brands business, which accounts for approximately 1\/4 of the year-to-year sales decline.","So overall, we are demonstrating resilience in making good progress -- and making good progress in expanding our market presence. Innovation remains at the core of our growth strategy and there is a real momentum here.","At the recent ISSA\/INTERCLEAN conference in North America, which was 2 weeks ago in Chicago, the team launched Crystal Shield which is an innovating floor care system that combines a diamond abrasion and coating technology that offers more durability and requires less maintenance in a much improved sustainable way.","Additionally, the team continues to expand the launch of Suma Combi, which is a combined detergent and rinse base for mechanical wear -- washing that can clean, rinse and dry, now replacing what took 3 different products before. This makes your version easier, faster and more sustainable for commercial kitchen uses.","And additionally, we're poised for more system launches in the fourth quarter. All of these innovations will drive enhanced growth in 2013.","And now looking to the right of this slide -- right side of this slide, profitability in the Diversey segment declined 17% on a reported basis against a challenging prior year comparison as the 2011 profitability benefited from $10 million of reversed bonus accruals. We, additionally, have an unfavorable foreign exchange effect this year -- this quarter. But on a constant dollar basis and excluding an unfavorable foreign exchange effect and the benefit of the lower bonus payments in 2011 and looking at the business on an apples-to-apples operational basis, profitability, in fact, rose a solid 42%.","And as you can see, by the operating profit bridge on this slide, the only real unfavorable year-on-year impact is our investment in headcount in high-growth regions, which is yielding strong top line growth in developing regions and is expanding our presence in targeted areas in North America. We expect these investments to become accretive within 12 to 18 months.","And now we will turn to Carol -- the call over to Carol, our CFO, to discuss third quarter financial results in more detail and highlight our outlook for the balance of the year.","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. Following along with your presentation, Slide 9 highlights our integration and optimization program.","Q3 benefited from $29 million in cost synergy, a $6 million increase over quarter 2. Our year-to-date cost synergies total $67 million. Our full year 2012 benefit is now estimated at $97 million, $7 million higher than previously expected, due to timing of benefits.","I should note that in addition, our cash costs for 2012 have declined $20 million to $105 million. We have moved this cash cost savings into 2013, and we'll continue to update you in future quarters on the amount and anticipated timing of our spending. We continue to hold the total program benefit at an estimated $195 million to $200 million through 2014 and total cash cost at $235 million over the life of the program.","Slide 10 summarizes our consolidated and adjusted EBITDA performance on both a pro forma and constant dollar basis. Year-over-year, constant dollar adjusted EBITDA accrued 2% on cost synergies and a favorable price cost spread of $18 million, with Food Packaging representing more than 1\/3 of the favorable spread. These impacts were partially offset by the resource investments in high-growth developing regions that Jerome just mentioned, as well as some unfavorable mix.","While the year-over-year increase is meaningful in light of the economic headwinds we continue to face, the real improvement story is the 19% improvement in adjusted EBITDA from the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.3% for Q3 improved from 11.4% in Q2 on seasonality, cost synergies, price cost spread, elimination of onetime items and reduction of other charges that negatively impacted Q2, as both Bill and Jerome have highlighted so far in their comments.","To bridge from the 2011 pro forma adjusted EBITDA including the effect of currency, you need to first revise the 2011 amount down from the $281 million to $271 million to reflect the benefit of the bonus and other compensation reductions previously mentioned that were recorded by Diversey in 2011.","Now if you bridge from the $271 million, you add the $29 million in cost synergies and $18 million positive price cost spread. These benefits were offset by negative currency of $14 million, approximately $17 million in mix and under absorption and $15 million higher SG&A, again, on the increased resources to support growth in the developing regions.","Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $28 million and $139 million year-to-date. Changes in working capital items for Q3 resulted in a net use of $75 million in the quarter. The increase in receivables of $58 million is largely due to an increase in exchange rates used to value quarter end receivable.","For example, the euro was approximately $1.26 at the end of June versus $1.29 at the end of September. Also the seasonality of our Diversey institutional and laundry business impacted receivables balance as Diversey's Q3 sales are seasonally higher than Q2. And the payment terms for the Diversey institutional and laundry customers is slightly longer than our other businesses.","Cash and cash equivalents were $541 million at September 30, which is an increase of $37 million from the balance at June 30. During Q3, we paid $121 million of interest, which is more than 1\/3 of the total $320 million that we anticipate paying during the year.","Cash payments in the quarter also included $23 million for income taxes, $30 million in 2013 term loan payments, $18 million related to our integration and optimization program and $25 million for our quarterly dividend.","Turning to Slide 12. As of September 30, we had total cash and committed liquidity of $1.4 billion and our net debt was $5.26 billion. Our net debt at year end is estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion. The estimated $500 million reduction from Q3 net debt balance will be funded by free cash flow plus approximately $300 million in proceeds from the sale of Diversey Japan. Achieving the $4.8 billion and net debt exceeds our stated goal of $4.95 billion by year end. We were also well within our covenant compliance at the end of Q3.","As noted in our earnings release this morning, the company has recorded a noncash pretax charge of $1.2 billion for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. The impairment on Diversey's segment resulted from lower growth rate and margin performance than anticipated a year ago, with the lower performance significantly impacted by negative macroeconomic conditions and primarily in Europe. The goodwill impairment is subject to finalization as we complete step 2 of the analysis during the fourth quarter.","Slide 13 notes our full year 2012 updated outlook that reflects the effect of discontinued operations from our Diversey Japan transaction, as well as the implied fourth quarter estimates for our 4 key guidance metrics. We expect reported or actual net sales of $7.7 billion with our business segment continuing to demonstrate sequential and year-over-year top line growth from seasonality and new customer wins; adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $995 million to $1.01 billion; adjusted EPS in the range of $0.90 to $1; and free cash flow of $375 million to $400 million. Our free cash flow estimate reflects traditionally high seasonal contribution in the fourth quarter from inventory reductions.","During Q4, we expect to complete the sale of Diversey Japan, finalize our impairment analysis and move our financial reporting to reflect our new operating segments. For Q4 in the full year 2012 reporting, our new segmentation will include Food and Beverage, Institutional and Laundry, Protective Packaging and Other, which is mainly comprised of our medical applications business.","And now I'll turn the call back to Bill to lead the Q&A session.","William V. Hickey","Okay, thank you. Thank you, Carol, and thank you, Jerome. As I indicated earlier, as your questions come in, I'll ask Carol and Jerome to field them. And of course, based on historical knowledge, I'm here to help the 2 of them.","So operator, can we open up the call to any questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just on Diversey Japan, it seemed like a very, very profitable business compared to the rest of Diversey and it seems like a pretty strong franchise just judging by the margins. Can you take us through the logic of selling this business versus any other part of the portfolio, perhaps on the legacy Sealed Air side?","William V. Hickey","Yes, sure. And this is the first one, I think we said we're reviewing our portfolio of both Sealed Air, legacy Sealed Air and legacy Diversey. The Japan situation is -- it is a profitable business. It's the #1 franchise in Japan. But we looked at it as a very slow growth business. The Japanese economy, although strong, continues to have very, very slow growth. We have a leading market share, so we see very little opportunity to gain additional growth through share gains, as well as the Japanese economy, which we expect to continue to be -- Ghansham, we did a forecast out for Japan that discounted cash flow and looked at it and said, if someone is willing to give us that value today or higher, it makes sense. And it was -- and actually it had been run pretty autonomously from the Diversey business. It had its own separate product offering for the Japanese market. It had a number of products that were not consistent with our global portfolio. And when you looked at it, all considered, if we could monetize the discounted cash flow, it made sense to do it.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then perhaps a question for Jerome. Jerome, you're inheriting some very, very strong franchises but also some very big challenges, particularly the financial leverage at Sealed Air. Can you sort of outline some early thoughts on how you see the strategy at Sealed Air evolving under your leadership?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Ghansham, for the question. Now as I arrived 2 months ago, I have, by definition, traveled around the world, sometimes with Bill, sometimes without, and there are some very key highlights that I want to take out at this point in time. 2012 has been a year of transition very, very clearly. In my previous life, I had led the integration of the largest acquisition that Dow ever had made. And in reality, the word, \"Who moved my cheese?\" has to be present in everybody's mind because you have a lot of employees who have been unsettled by this kind of acquisition -- by any kind of acquisition. My approach is that I want to rally employees around our project, and our project is a growth project, is a growth project leveraging the equipment and the products we have into solutions, which are absolutely unique. And the commonality between the Diversey business that we have and the Sealed Air 2 business units that we have is that we have equipment which complements products when they're with solutions. It is very true in our Diversey industrial and laundry business, for example, we have all kinds of machinery and equipment like the TASKI machines themselves which make us the global leader in floor polishing [ph] and this kind of things. And you -- when you look at our Cryovac business, it is the same. When you look at our product packaging business, it is the same. So that's one commonality. The second thing is that I want to accelerate the new Sealed Air into -- and put our investment where population needs more packaged foods, more consumer -- or where consumers consume more proteins, where there is a need for more food safety and sanitization and hospitality improvements and where product production needs to be packaged in higher quality. So it really tells you where we are going to be investing. And actually, if there is one thing which has been surprising me at -- already is the amount of technology that we have in the pipeline. So that's where I'm going to be focusing my attention into.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner at Barclays.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you just talk a little bit about the trends in Food Packaging throughout the quarter? I think you had a slide out there, middle of the quarter talking about July up 6% to 7%, maybe it was 5% to 6%. But looks like Food Packaging came in at plus 2% organic and Food Solutions plus 1%. Can you just sort of walk us through what sort of happened then during the quarter?","Carol P. Lowe","Scott, just one thing before -- and then Jerome will follow on with the trend, but what you're looking at was Food Packaging and Food Solutions together. Whereas for our quarterly, we -- it is broken apart. I just wanted to highlight that for you.","Jerome A. Peribere","Okay, so what have we observed in Food Packaging? First of all is that when you exclude currency, our sales have been going up 2% and our operating income has been going up slightly less than 1%. We had, in fact, an unfavorable geographical mix. But we have some very interesting things happening. We had volume increase overall 2%, with 8% volume growth in Latin America, double-digit growth in Asia and a stable North America, with a negative product mix there. But we have also growth in Europe. That is for our Food Packaging business. Sequentially, we had suffered from quarter -- Q1 also in the second quarter, so no surprise that we're back on track with our kind of historical profitability in that segment. On Food Solutions, we've been doing quite well and we had our volume grow in North America by over 7% or almost 8%; Latin America, double digit; Europe, slightly negative; but Asia, Middle East, Turkey has been growing 20%. So how did that happen? Let me remind you that the Food Packaging is our traditional protein industrial packaging and our Food Solution is mostly [indiscernible] ready, our fluid high-barrier voucher that were microwavable type of products, so more consumer-driven. In North America, we have benefited from a very good growth in our pouches business for an exceptionally -- added by an exceptionally favorable tomato crop. But this is a very good new solution, which is a very strong alternative with lots of customer benefits versus can and for tomato, for example. So that's a very good type of new growth, which has been accelerated by a good agriculture tomato crop. But it's just a solution which is imposing itself. In Latin America, we try -- we're taking pricing actions in Brazil and in Argentina. The only negative spot is in Australia and New Zealand. Actually in Australia where we had a lot of rigid turbo foaming tubs [ph] and we lost to it on price also against competition. So generally speaking, this Food Packaging sector is starting to -- is somewhat tied to what's going on in the meat market. And again, we'd go on and talk about red fresh meat versus poultry and versus pork, but also we have innovation in different sectors, and this goes to a 50 [ph] type of products, which we are working strongly on, freshness, case-ready, multiple bags. The new consumer benefit packaging, which is our FoldLOK, as I mentioned earlier in -- as it were, specialty retail, which is actually pretty successful, and high-powered protein. So I think that this is going well. And what I'd like to mention is that our people internally are now working by leveraging this food packaging presence with our hygiene solutions where we have growth synergies and we're starting to see some benefits there of the former Diversey business in sanitation.","Scott Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate all the color. So did growth actually slow in the quarter though, on the combined businesses?","Jerome A. Peribere","I didn't hear you well.","Carol P. Lowe","First, where we reported -- at the conference slide that you're referring to for the combined businesses, we were reporting kind of year-over-year on an average daily sales basis, and they weren't quite as strong through the balance 2 months versus August.","Jerome A. Peribere","Yes. Having said that, there's something, which is interesting. If you look at the Q3 volume, in Food Packaging and Food Solutions versus the year-to-date volume, the pace is accelerating. The Q3 volume in Food Packaging has been 2%. The Q3 volume in Food Solutions has been 2.3%. And when you look at the year-to-date, with just likely 1% on Food Packaging and just likely around 0.5% in the Food Solutions. So when I look at Q3 volume compared to the year-to-date, I'm seeing a positive trend there.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.","","The next question comes from the line of George Staphos at Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess I had 2 -- actually 3 questions, I'll try to make it brief. First of all -- and I joined the call late, so I apologize. First of all, there were a number of operating issues within Food Packaging back in the last quarter. Do you feel comfortable that you are on the path to resolving those by the end of the year, which is what I remember being the last [indiscernible]","Carol P. Lowe","George, I'll go ahead and respond to that and Bill can add a little bit of color because he was recently in Brazil, which is where a lot of the operating issues were highlighted for Q2. But yes, we feel like definitely the onetime items were onetime. And we have seen significant operational improvement, which is noted in the operating -- the adjusted operating margin for the Food Packaging. So I'll let Bill -- he can comment specifically with the bag line and what he saw in Brazil.","William V. Hickey","George, I think as we mentioned, one of the big items in Q2 was we moved the production line from our downtown S\u00e3o Paulo plant out to our new plant, which is about 120 kilometers away, which has a lower cost structure and more room for expansion. And we took down one of our major extrusion lines and we believe we've built up enough inventory because we've tried to pick a slow time of the year. Customer demand just picked up. That line was down. I think as we mentioned on Q2, we had to bring in products from the U.S., freight and duty. That line has moved. As I said earlier, Jerome and I were in Brazil last week. I actually said I wanted to see this line operating. It's up. It's installed in the new plant. It's producing product at a lower cost. And we put the 390 basis points back on the Food Packaging operating margin. We're not completely moved. There will be a Phase 2 sometime either early next year with the ultimate goal of moving the second and third extrusion lines out. But right now, we're back on track.","Carol P. Lowe","And, George, we would expect our exit rate out of Q4 for Food Packaging to be around 13% margin as opposed to the 12% that we discussed in our Q2 call.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's great. Let me ask one more question because I remember you typically have a 2-question limit, and this is a bigger picture question. I realize maybe a bit more difficult to answer. But this quarter, you took a $1.2 billion goodwill impairment for Diversey. You have to do what you have to do. That's on top of what's been $100 million or so of restructuring charges for the business this year. So one could argue that in terms of the relative level of investment, perhaps the value of -- ascribed to Diversey initially was maybe $1.3 billion too high. And as you look back at Diversey, where do you think the miscalibration, if you'd agree with that, came from? And did it -- has that anything to do with, perhaps?","William V. Hickey","Yes. No, George, I wouldn't call it a [indiscernible] in time. I mean, if you remember the numbers we were looking at 18 months ago when we went through the acquisition analysis, the euro was in the high $1.40s. That filters to the earnings model, into the valuation. And also the European economy until March of '11 was holding up reasonably well. So we were looking at one, continued growth; and two, bringing those euros back to dollars at $1.48. I think when we updated our model that the accountants require us to do once a year, is you now take a lower earnings stream and you reduce the currency effect and you end up with a different value than you did a year ago. That's not an out-of-line situation. And I would venture to say that 2 years from now, you come up with a different number, it's -- probably be higher, but the accountants won't let you put it back.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, we look forward to that, but what you're saying is it's more the market, not the actual underlying performance or as it was presented to you?","William V. Hickey","Right, we do say -- I mean, the performance is less than our initial analysis showed 18 months ago, but they've been primarily from factors outside the business.","Jerome A. Peribere","You see, let me add a little bit of flavor there. You can imagine that I'm spending a lot of time looking at this part of the business. And when you look at the overall numbers for Europe in the first quarter, they are not very impressive. Having said that, you need to remember that we have some components of the business, which are equipment driven. And what we have observed for our company in Europe -- in Southern Europe is that our equipment sales are dramatically low. Well, who in Italy, in Spain or in Portugal today would be buying equipment? So that shop segment has suffered to a certain extent. Another segment, which has suffered is a little bit in our retail brands of business, generally speaking. And that's one other thing. When I -- what is important to me to see are we retreating in the core of our businesses in chemicals in various countries, et cetera, et cetera? And actually, I am quite pleased with the fact that we are starting to see a few very interesting things coming up. I'm pleased to see that our French business is doing quite well or is not retreating. I am pleased to see that our East European business is growing double digits. I'm pleased to see that our Asian business and our Latin American business is going double digits. And this is not only on the quarter but it is year-to-date. So you take our Chinese business, which has been growing 22% in this quarter and year-to-date, very nice additional number. So what is important to me is, where are the pockets of softness? And when I look at this quarter, for example, for the European Union business, more than 80% of our negative growth is coming from, guess where, Italy, Portugal and Spain. So am I pleased that this is -- that we're retreating? Absolutely not. But I can understand that this is not market share losses and on the contrary versus what is the local situation, fairly negative.","Operator","It comes from Rosemarie Morbelli at Gabelli.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Could you give us a little more detail on the Diversey business both in Europe and North America? I mean, you have focus on a couple of areas. But if you look at Diversey overall, do you see any changes in market trends, in your market share? Do you have and could you give us some -- an update actually on the progress on the F&B category?","Jerome A. Peribere","Okay. Well, you've got F&B and then you've got our I&L or Diversey in general. I just talked quite a lot about it. We are growing faster than competition in where we really are seeing the future of our business. And that is extremely reassuring to me. When I see that we're growing double digit in Turkey, I'm pleased. When I see that we're growing in South Asia double digits, I'm pleased. When I'm seeing that Hong Kong -- that in India we're growing over 15%, and I'm not talking necessarily only in the quarter but also year-to-date. I'm saying that in the areas where there's a very deep crisis, we are coming down. When there is a very specific investment issue, equipment I just mentioned, we're coming down. Where there is potential for growth, we are flagging [ph]. On our North European business, it has had troughs and it is stable. On -- the good -- I'm going to give you just one country, which is Greece, where you would expect that there is 0 business. Well, you know what? Year-to-date, we've been 11% down. Quarter -- the third quarter, 1% down. So things are stabilizing here. And North America, which in some subsegments has been a weak spot, is improving. We're making good inroads in health care. We're making good inroads in hospitality, and you're going to hear some more about it pretty soon.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","And if I may, raw material costs have come down in general, and they have helped your margins to a certain degree. Do you feel that as of next quarter you are going to have to start giving back pricing?","William V. Hickey","Carol?","Carol P. Lowe","No. So Rosemarie, we actually -- we expect the raw materials on hold to kind of stay flat. We're not expecting to give up much in terms of pricing. There may be some modest offset based on the decline we've seen so far in raw material costs, especially as we have some customers on contract, but not a significant impact.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Manuel at Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Gabe Hajde on for Chris. You guys have referenced lower equipment sales, I think, once in a press release or the presentation and your remarks. Just talk about the relationship with the consumable, I guess, products for that business. And maybe looking out in 2013, could that have a negative impact on that business?","William V. Hickey","Yes. Let me just give you a little background here. Usually, as Jerome very eloquently indicated earlier, so our business is built on the solution where the equipment provides the vehicle for the customers to use our consumables. And that historically, it's about $10 of equipment sales for $100 of consumer sales. So it's a little about 10% of the mix. But it does generate a fair amount of consumer sales. We have looked at equipment placement as an indicator of future consumable sales, but I wouldn't necessarily make any particular conclusion about the comments that we made on the Diversey side. Because equipment placements on protective business are still holding up quite well. And on the food business, they're holding up reasonably well. So I wouldn't necessarily draw a conclusion. But I think it's a good point to keep in mind that positive equipment sales generally drive future consumer sales. And slower equipment sales generally means slower consumer sales growth. But remember the ones that are installed out there become an annuity year-after-year.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And I think there's commentary about $500 million of asset sales or potential asset sales. Can you comment around the portfolio evaluation, whether or not you guys are done or are still looking?","Carol P. Lowe","I'll respond to that. Yes, there are additional assets that we're looking at and it's across geographies, across the businesses. So we'll continue to work that through the balance of the year and into 2013. Because our comment on the up to $500 million was over a 12-month period, so we're still looking for opportunities where we have certain either lines of business or product models and things that just don't fit for the long-term strategy.","Jerome A. Peribere","Having said that, we just went through the big start.","Carol P. Lowe","Right. absolutely.","Operator","This should come from Phil Gresh.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, the first question is just on the asset sales as a follow-up, and I apologize if someone already asked this, just tell me. But would you say that a sale of the size you just completed was contemplated in the $500 million target that you gave before or was that kind of...","Carol P. Lowe","No. Yes, it was.","William V. Hickey","It was.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then if you've talked about this, the outlook for the food businesses in 2013, how you're thinking about volume trends there given the lower slaughter rate potential?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, when you look at the trends, the fresh red meat market in North America is trending negatively. The Latin America across various type of meat, the fresh meats or the smoke and processed meat, the poultry, all of this is trending positively and also slightly negatively in Europe. Having said that, altogether, we're seeing a slight positive trend, call it 1% or so. That's the way we see it at this point in time.","Operator","Next question is from Al Kabili at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on the free cash flow reduction in the guidance, if you could just address what drove that. And also the working capital seasonally just seems to be performing less -- there was a bigger use of cash seasonally than what we're used to, and if you could address that as well.","Carol P. Lowe","Well, in my comments, originally, I talked about the working capital, that the biggest impact was the increase in receivables. And the biggest portion of that $59 million increase as we move forward in the quarter was because of the exchange rate. So a higher exchange rate primarily on our European receivables at the end of September versus the end of June and how they're valued on the balance sheet, that accounted for approximately $30 million of the $59 million increase in receivable. Also, seasonally, we have higher sales within our Diversey institutional and laundry business. And in Q3 versus Q2, that also utilized receivables, extended them because those customers tend to have longer payment terms than the rest of our businesses. So that's the biggest driver on working capital. And I also commented about the cash flow for the quarter, we had a large portion of the interest payment that we anticipate making for the full year, was made in Q3, so more than half of it. So that was a big drain on the cash flow as well.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And the reduction in the outlook, is that largely working cap and currency or in this divestiture or is there anything else that drives that reduction versus your [indiscernible]","Carol P. Lowe","The reduction is that we're not performing quite at the level we had estimated previously. Some of it is currency, actually a big portion of it is, as well as just managing the overall working capital. We do expect a meaningful reduction in inventory in Q4, but we just haven't hit the levels that we were originally planning.","Albert T. Kabili - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right, that helps. And just a follow-up on just that Diversey sale. How will you handle this from a branding perspective? There's a lot of established brands, but how are you going to handle this globally now that you've got an outside party in Japan with those brands? And can you comment if the portfolio review would include additional pieces of Diversey?","William V. Hickey","This is Bill. Let me comment on the branding because I know it was an item that came up during the negotiations. We have entered into a brand license agreement with the buyers for the Japan business, which runs for a number of years, and they will pay us an ongoing royalty. They will be a distributor for our TASKI systems as well as license the Diversey brand, and they will even keep the Diversey name for a period of time. So those matters are all being worked out as part of the sale process. And the second part of your question is, as Carol indicated earlier, the portfolio review covers our entire business, not just Diversey but as legacy Sealed Air. And I really am not in a position to comment what, if any, pieces of what businesses are being discussed until we have an opportunity to say it at the right time.","Operator","We have another question now from George Staphos at Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One more question. Jerome, what are your initial impressions of Sealed Air prior to [indiscernible] and what, if any, experience from your time at Dow with Rohm and Haas is relevant to [indiscernible]","Jerome A. Peribere","So you might -- my first impression is that this is a company, which is in transition in 2012, as I said earlier, and it has potential. And that's the main reason. You might wonder why an EVP of Dow would just come and take the lead at Sealed Air. And the reason is exactly that, is that after the due diligence I have done is that I believe that this company has great potential. As a result of that, I jumped. So the similarity between Dow Rohm and Haas or call it Dow Advanced Materials and Sealed Air are many and more than one might think. Number one, any integration is a delicate process. It's a process where on one side, you go for the cost synergies because you have to; and on the other side, you need to look at the growth synergies and you -- and all of this is enabled by employees. So either you go and build a project or you don't. If you build a project, you're going to engage employees. And if you don't, you're going to have them look somewhere else and away from what you're trying to build. That's what I have done for 3 years at Dow Advanced Materials, and that's what I am spending most of my efforts -- not most of my efforts -- but a lot of efforts right now. I want to federate our employee population. We have 26,500 employees. Those are people who look for the projects of Sealed Air. And I'll tell you, I very, very strongly believe that the right people are the ones that the company needs to build a company and build a project. So the other similarity with Dow Advanced Materials is that this is a specialty business. And any specialty business is built stone-by-stone, brick-by-brick and it takes time. So it takes time, it takes efforts, it takes persistence and it takes employee engagements. That's what I'm really looking at and working. So I'm not miracle man. It's going to take time, but I do believe this company has some potential.","William V. Hickey","Operator, we kind of run out of our allotted time. And I know today is a busy day for other calls, and we've moved everyone to Friday. So I would like to thank everyone for your participation.","I think you see that our third quarter results set the right tone and momentum going into the fourth quarter. Our pending sale of Diversey Japan accelerates our debt reduction and help us to exceed our annual debt targets. Innovation and new solutions continue to be a key factor in our ability to differentiate Sealed Air from our competitors. And we have a number of new products that Jerome indicated we're truly excited about. In the meantime, we're going to continue to focus on executing our plan, integrating Diversey and maximizing free cash flow. Thank you again, and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you very much.

Ted?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Lori. Welcome to Sealed Air's third quarter conference call. First, I'll recap our third quarter results. Second, I will share actions we are taking to improve our performance. And lastly, I'll provide an update on our profitable growth strategy and how our focus on operational excellence will drive a step change in our future results.","In the third quarter, net sales were $1.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA was $219 million and adjusted EPS was $0.61. We increased sales on a constant dollar basis by 8%, yet EBITDA was only up 4%. This lack of operating leverage was disappointing. As soon as we were aware of the shortfall, we wanted to be transparent which is why we pre-announced on October 17. Given our global footprint, we recognized we were facing unfavorable currency, higher input and freight costs and geographic challenges stemming from tariffs. Food Care managed through these headwinds in the quarter, while the impact on Product Care was more pronounced.","Let me briefly unpack the quarter by division. We delivered a strong third quarter in Food Care despite currency headwinds and higher input and freight costs. Constant dollar sales were up 6% and adjusted EBITDA was up 10%. Operating leverage improved sequentially, and it was encouraging to see some of the actions we took just last quarter had an impact on our results. There's still more work to do on productivity and efficiency in Food Care and that work is currently underway.","Product Care, on the other hand, fell short of expectations. Constant dollar sales growth was up 12%, yet adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat compared to last year, and operating leverage was negative. We're not satisfied with this performance and we're addressing the issues head on. Global volumes were down 2% in the quarter with a 7% drop in our utility business. This business accounts for 30% of Product Care sales. Competition across our utility portfolio intensified in North America and the UK, and we experienced a slowdown in China due to tariff uncertainties. We're making process on upgrading many of our customers to more sustainable and automated solutions, but this shift is not happening fast enough.","We're accelerating our actions in Product Care to take cost out of the business, while at the same time, strengthening our sustainability and automated solutions portfolio. The actions currently underway are being funded by our existing restructuring program. We expect our efforts to eliminate stranded costs from the Diversey sale to be largely complete by year-end, which is six months to nine months ahead of plan. This accelerated effort will result in $40 million of annualized savings realized in 2018 as compared to our prior expectation of $30 million. In 2019, we expect to realize another $25 million of annualized savings from these efforts. The projects remaining are being prioritized to address Product Care as quickly as possible.","To achieve operational excellence across our entire organization, we're redesigning our operating model. This encompasses how we innovate, buy, make and sell. We expect to announce a more detailed company-wide plan before year-end to enhance efficiency and productivity in four areas: SG&A, product costs, speed to market on innovations, and channel optimizations.","Taking a step back, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our market opportunities. With respect to Food Care, we delivered 6% constant dollar growth while the protein markets we serve were essentially flat. We benefited from both an increase in our core products and continued market penetration of our new innovations. Sales of our case-ready platform had continued to increase in all regions. Within this platform, we're seeing incremental sales from our sustainable trays and lids that offer extended shelf life, higher consumer appeal, and already meet our 2025 sustainability and plastics pledge.","The pipeline for our FlexPrep solution for the fluids market continues to expand, and we're investing in capacity to support future growth. This solution, which integrates equipment, materials, and dispensing technologies, provides significant savings to the food processor, as well as to the quick-service restaurant industry. We are confident Food Care will continue to deliver above market growth rates on the top line, while driving strong operating leverage.","Moving, now, to Product Care, we're focusing on growth areas that are top of mind with our customers: sustainability and automation. As a result, we're seeing growth in our Bubble Wrap on-demand platform, automated systems, including I-Pack, FloWrap, StealthWrap, paper systems and Korrvu, all of which are designed to minimize waste, reduce damage and\/or eliminate the need for a box. Today, these value-added e-commerce and fulfillment solutions combined make up 20% of our Product Care sales and year-to-date have grown 10%. The highest growth is coming from our Bubble Wrap on-demand platform. We're driving more growth from automated packaging solutions.","Another growth area we see in 2019 is within our B2B offerings, or our specialty industrial applications, which today accounts for approximately 40% of our sales and has been growing in the low-single digits. Our B2B customers are increasing pressure to modify their packaging for the small parcel e-commerce fulfillment network, a trend you've heard us talk about called Ship in Own Container or SIOC. With the integration of Fagerdala and AFP acquisitions, we now have an advanced end-to-end offering with integrated fabrication capabilities in our specialty foam and Instapak solutions. Focusing our efforts on our differentiated portfolio and streamlining our utility business will lead to improved EBITDA margins in Product Care.","Let me now shift to an important topic embedded in our strategy: sustainability. I'm excited to share that we've announced a bold, new sustainability and plastics pledge, committing to delivering 100% recyclable and reusable offerings by 2025. In addition to accelerating our sustainability efforts within our organization, we will collaborate with partners around the world to increase recycling and reusable rates. This commitment aligns with our mission as a company to lead the industry to a more sustainable future.","I will now pass the call to Bill to review the third quarter results and our outlook. Bill?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Ted. Let's start with the review of our net sales by region on slide 6. In the third quarter, sales increased 5% as reported and 8% in constant dollars. We delivered constant dollar growth across all regions. North America was up 6% and 3% on an organic basis or excluding currency and acquisitions.","Food Care in North America was up 4%. Product Care in North America increased 9%, including acquisitions and 2% on an organic basis. EMEA was up 2% with positive trends in the UK, Italy, Germany, and Russia. Asia Pacific increased 18% in constant dollars and 2% on an organic basis. Food Care Asia Pacific was up 4%, driven by growth in Australia and in New Zealand. Latin America was up 1% as reported and 24% in constant dollars. Volume was up 7% due to increased demand in Brazil, Mexico where we benefited from new business and a stronger export market within our Food Care customers.","On slide 7, we present our year-to-date performance. Sales were up 7% on an as reported basis and in constant dollars with positive trends across all regions.","Slide 8 highlights volume and price\/mix trends by division and by region. In the third quarter, on a global basis, we delivered favorable price\/mix of 4%. Price\/mix was favorable in Food Care and Product Care due to previously announced price increases, formula pass-throughs, and continued shift to value-added solutions. We were able to get positive price realization in Latin America to offset the currency devaluation. Volume was up 1% globally. Food Care volumes were up 3% with positive trends in all regions. Product Care volumes excluding acquisitions declined 2% globally due to a 3% decline in North America primarily related to our utility business.","On slide 9, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the third quarter. I covered sales trends in the last two slides, so my comments now will focus on EBITDA performance. Adjusted EBITDA of $219 million, increased 4% on a constant dollar basis. Margins were down 70 basis points to 18.5%. Favorable mix and price\/cost spread of $17 million, restructuring savings of $11 million, and volume of $3 million were offset by higher operating costs of $22 million.","Higher operating costs were related to salary and wage inflation, rising non-material manufacturing cost and investments to support our growth programs. Unfavorable currency was $7 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.61 on average diluted shares outstanding of 158 million shares. Our adjusted tax rate was 28% in the third quarter. We now estimate that our full year adjusted tax rate is going to be 27%, which is in line with our year-to-date adjusted rate.","Slide 10 displays our year-to-date sales and EBITDA bridges. Focusing on our year-to-date EBITDA performance, higher volumes, favorable mix and price\/cost spread, and restructuring savings were offset by higher operating costs.","Turning to our results by division on slide 11, we present Q3 and year-to-date results for our Food Care division. We were pleased with Food Care's results in the third quarter, especially in light of the currency headwinds. Sales were up 6% in constant dollars to $727 million due to higher volumes and favorable price\/mix. As we anticipated, equipment sales returned to growth in the quarter and we expect this trend to continue into year-end. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% in constant dollars to $145 million or 20% of net sales. Food Care delivered strong operating leverage and you can see from this bridge that we continue to invest in our operations to support future growth and improve manufacturing efficiencies.","On slide 12, we highlight results from our Product Care division. In the third quarter, Product Care net sales increased 12% in constant dollars to $459 million. Excluding acquisitions, Product Care sales were up 1%. Adjusted EBITDA of $76 million was essentially flat compared to last year. As indicated in the EBITDA bridge, margin was under pressure as favorable mix and price\/cost spread was more than offset by lower sales volumes and higher operating costs.","Let's now turn to our free cash flow for the nine months on slide 13. Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30 was a source of cash of $80 million, and that includes $42 million of the one-time payment we made in January of 2018 to an outside engineering firm in lieu of certain future royalties. To-date, capital expenditures were $115 million, interest payments net of interest income were $125 million and cash tax payments were $137 million. Restructuring payments dedicated to our core operations were $7 million.","Turning to our total company 2018 outlook on slide 14. I want to reiterate our 2018 guidance that we outlined on October 17. Full-year net sales are now expected to be $4.7 billion or a 5% growth as reported and 6% growth in constant dollars. By division, we continue to anticipate 4% constant dollar growth in Food Care. For Product Care, we now forecast 9% constant dollar growth as compared to our previous 11% expectation. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.45. And I would like to highlight that this represents an increase of approximately 35% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is expected to be approximately $870 million to $880 million, which is an increase of 6%. Currency is expected to have a negative impact on full-year 2018 net sales and adjusted EBITDA of $40 million and $10 million respectively. Unfavorable currency will impact our Food Care results due to its exposure to Europe, to Latin America, and Australia.","For the full year, our outlook for free cash flow is $350 million. Cash tax payments are now expected to be $165 million. CapEx is on track to be $160 million and interest, net of interest income is expected to be $175 million. Cash restructuring payments dedicated to our core operations are expected to be $15 million. Stranded costs restructuring payments, which are excluded from our $350 million free cash flow outlook, are expected to be $25 million.","Our efforts to eliminate stranded costs will be largely complete by the end of 2018. Heading into 2019, we will incur the remaining $35 million in restructuring payments under our existing program, most of which will be directed towards our core operations. The cumulative restructuring payments incurred in 2018 and 2019 of $75 million are in line with our prior expectations.","At this point, I will turn the call back over to Ted, so he can conclude our prepared remarks.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Bill. In summary, we know we have a lot of work to do. We're redesigning our operating model with a focus on efficiency and productivity improvements and look forward to sharing our plan before year-end. We clearly see the power of our iconic brands, differentiated technology, leading market position, and deep customer relationships with more value to be captured in existing and adjacent markets. We look forward to discussing our efforts to achieve higher and accelerated returns on our innovations and become a more efficient organization. Our focus is to drive profitable growth at Sealed Air and enhance value for our customers, our people, and our shareholders.","With that, I now open up the call for questions.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.","Molly Baum - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is actually Molly sitting in for George. We had a few other calls today. But could you just give some more detail on where competition is gaining on you in the utility areas of protective packaging and kind of more detail on how you're combating these with your automated systems? Thank you.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure. First of all, on the Product Care, the issue that we had there with \u2013 we talked about our rising cost we had from currency et cetera, et cetera. But as far as the competition on the price, on the volume where we don't have an automated solution, we would lose out. We think we do need to work, continue to take our cost out of the product and also to drive more of our automated solutions.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. You may proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess, just following-up on the last question on Product Care, looking back over time, Ted, I mean, significant price increases have been instituted in the past for the segment, including the utility sub-segment, I would presume. What was different this particular time around? You still have the same number of competitors, it seems like. Was there any sort of element of destocking of inventory at the end market? And also, on your comments on tariffs, can you just expand on that in terms of the impact? Thank you.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. And I apologize I didn't do a good job on the first question because I was moving my papers around. On the Product Care, what's moving in the market as we drive to the automated solution, we got to get our costs down on our products. And so, that's what we're fighting with. The issue is raising price on rising costs is not sustainable. We have to take the cost out of those products. What we call as a commodity product is actually the materials that are going into the packaging solution. We have to take that cost down and we have to take significant action on that. Our productivity has not gained, and we need to do work on that.","The second piece, where the market is going, for instance, in Product Care where one person would load a package, that's moving now to a semi-automated state where I shared with our Bubble Wrap on-demand system, where instead of a person who can load four, five a minute with now Bubble Wrap on-demand, we can double that. But where the market is going, how do we go to a lights-out warehouse? How do we go to fully automated into systems like our FloWrap or our StealthWrap? Those are actually taking our shrink film materials and driving to a much, much higher level of automation. So, we need to do two things. We've got to take the cost out of our materials and we've got to accelerate our equipment side of the business on the automation. So, wanted to answer both questions a second time.","The issue on the tariffs, the tariffs are choppy for us around the world. We did see we had more of an impact on that on the Food Care as the market is moving. We saw the U.S. with the tariffs going back and forth to Canada, and then to China. We saw some leveling that out. We think, over time, that will take place. The tariffs hit us harder on Product Care with the Brexit, but even with some of the announcements we saw this morning, we think over time the tariffs will play out because we do have a global footprint. In the quarter, though, it did have an impact to our business, but going forward, I think we'll be able to balance that out.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the portfolio in general, obviously, really strong results from Food Care to \u2013 not quite offset the really weak results in Product Care there, and they strike me as two very different businesses, fundamentally. I know you guys lead through technology in both, but in terms of, like, what each business is serving end market-wise, quite a bit different.","Just wondering as you're going through the process of taking a hard look at the cost structure, taking a hard look at where restructuring savings can be found, would you consider a strategic review of that Product Care business, given private transaction multiples are pretty high for plastic packaging companies and some of the good growth in the e-commerce part of it? Just wondering how you would think about potential to monetize that in the given environment and maybe free up the strong Food Care trends from what's been a little bit of a weaker Product Care story in the last couple of quarters?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure. We definitely see \u2013 we're always analyzing our portfolio, first of all, so we're looking at that. We're actually analyzing it all the way down to the SKU level on the entire business. We actually do see many synergies in the Food Care and Product Care. And I'm seeing that even clearly now as we pulled Diversey off the business. If you look at the process of Food Care and Product Care, they both have materials, the materials go through equipment, loading on a process, and we see the channels actually coming in together as well.","Our largest customer buying a food company, we see the biothermal markets coming together using products to load food. So, we see the markets coming together. Really on the Product Care side, it's really a cost issue that we got to get ahead of. And again pulling Diversey out, looking at our SG&A, looking at our product costs together as a whole, we see opportunities on the SG&A, opportunities on the product \u2013 on the cost as well as how we go to market with our innovation in our channels. So, we actually see those synergies across the company.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. You may proceed.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Ted. Good morning, Bill.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just Bill \u2013 Ted, going back to the four buckets you outlined, SG&A, product costs, speed to market and channel optimization. Can you talk about or rank order those buckets? Which one do you think can drive the most step change in ROIC? And why do you think now is different than maybe the last four years for those buckets of costs? Thanks.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure. I'll go through each one. First, looking at the SG&A, we analyzed SG&A top down, looking at us compared to our peers. We've also now looked at it bottoms up. But just to highlight, the SG&A again pulling out Diversey, if you look at our SG&A as a percent of sales before Diversey, we've actually had a gain of 100 basis points on that SG&A. Definitely we think we have an opportunity with our layers and the complexity of our business on the whole company, I think SG&A piece, we can go after pretty hard and we think that's an opportunity to go after.","The second piece is going after the product cost or the product efficiency or productivity. Again, looking at our business, we've done a nice job of being the price leader, but if you look at the productivity of the business, we've been raising price on higher cost. We think we have a significant opportunity to go aggressive at our cost structure and drive our productivity to a higher level and actually get year-over-year productivity. The third area on speed to market the innovation, we are an innovative company. So, how do we measure that? Well, we measure by our vitality index when we say 10% today of our new products that we're introducing has been developed in the last five years. We need to double that. We should be an innovative company, we should have 20% of its portfolio from products that were developed in the last five years. We have a significant opportunity to improve our innovation.","And the last one is the channel optimization. Again, the Food Care business goes highly direct. The Product Care goes through distribution. We think we have an opportunity to do a much better job in our channel optimization. A 100% dedicated distribution team can do significantly more for our profitability than where we are today. All of this is what we're building to see \u2013 we share with you before the 25% productivity on the leverage that we need going forward. We have to focus on these four elements to go and to take that well north of that 25% year-over-year leverage. And that's why we're designing into our new model going forward.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. You may proceed.","Bryan Burgmeier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. This is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. Just thinking longer term, is there any reason why Product Care can't get back to its legacy margins in the 20% range and what would you consider to be normalized volume growth for this business now?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","For the first question, absolutely. The Product Care business, we think we can get there. And as I outlined those four buckets we're going after on the productivity and the costs, we want to get there faster. On the second piece on long term, we think that we have a great business here because here because the markets we serve are basically GDP. What we have to do is beat the market through our innovations and so drive a higher level of growth in GDP. So, going forward, we think we have a business that we should be beating marginally about GDP.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. You may proceed.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. My question is on Latin America. You noted things went well in Mexico and Brazil. Can you give us some more color in terms of volumes for these two countries and how are things expected to shape up there over the course of 2019 given what seems to be very good performance so far in 2018?","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? I think you're talking about Latin America. Did you ask specifically about Brazil and Mexico? I just \u2013 I didn't hear your question.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Sure, yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. So, how are volumes shaping up in Mexico and Brazil that you noted things are looking well and how should we think about these regions as we go into 2019?","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Bill, do you want to take that?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes. So, definitely from a volume perspective, very happy with our results in Latin America. Excluding acquisitions, from a total company perspective, we had a 7% increase in volume. We were very happy especially on our Food Care Latin America business because in the face of a very, very unfavorable FX environment, we were able to pass those FX increases onto customers and have a very, very strong performance there in our Latin America business. So, we're highly pleased with our results in Brazil relative to the strength of the Food Care business. The expansion of sales to existing customers, some new customers, and we're happy with Mexico as well. We're very optimistic for that Latin America business as we go looking through the balance of 2018. We've not, at this point, highlighted any guidance for 2019. But our optimism relative to our Latin American business continues.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","And just one other piece on that, Latin America and our global presence has helped with the tariffs in some of the trade issues. Having a strong base in Brazil and in Mexico, specifically on the fresh red meat market, has opened us up where we've had some tariff issues going back and forth to Asia Pacific and the U.S. Our presence in Brazil has helped on their growth and that should help us going forward.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies. You may proceed.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. You mentioned improvement in the vitality index, I think over the next five years. I'm sorry, over the next couple of years doubling it. I was just wondering which segment or sub-segment do you see the most opportunity for that.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","We see it actually in both. If we look at our pipeline of innovation, some pretty exciting things are going on, and both of them are focused on the automation. On the Product Care side, as we are moving, our customers are struggling with labor, cost of labor, scarcity of labor. So, how can they actually load more pieces into their packages? So, some of our innovations such as our FloWrap, our StealthWrap, how do we bring some automated equipment, automated solutions, we're pretty excited about that.","On the Food Care side, we see some exciting opportunities that are actually moving this year as we move our flexible packaging into the rigid container market. I've mentioned in my prepared remarks our FlexPrep that we're going after the condiments market. We're seeing great traction there. We're investing in more capacity. So we just need to pull those innovations where we can really solve some significant problems in the market quicker and faster.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about M&A and how you're thinking about it right now. Are you sort of putting a pause on that while you focus on taking cost out of Product Care and on share repurchases or are you parallel processing or just generally how are you thinking about M&A?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","On the M&A side where it's part of our capital allocation, we're looking for that to be opportunistic, obviously, with our share price on the buyback. The M&A that we've done so far has been accretive looking for in the Product Care. Part of the Product Care is the fixed part of our portfolio where we can grow faster. So, we have been looking in the integrated solution and in the automation space so we can go faster in that area.","Also, we're looking at the opportunities in our Food Care business since we can drive at an accelerated rate in bringing flexible packaging to the rigid container market, looking at liquids et cetera. So we're comparing those with our capital allocation structure to be opportunistic where we can.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. You may proceed.","Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - G.research LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about the beef cycle in North America, Australia, and then Latin America. And looking at your vitality index target of 20%, that is kind of low versus a lot of companies. So, is that the first step, and then you can move forward to a higher level like 30%, 35%?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah, the first question on the meat market looking around the world, we definitely see the \u2013 it was actually flat in the quarter for us, where we think, still, for the year it's going to be positive. Looking at the market being a little less than 2%, we think we'll actually be ahead of that. We're seeing still fairly strong in the U.S. and Brazil. I was actually in Russia this quarter and I got to see our largest customer in Russia doing quite well. So, Australia continued to see growth.","As far as the vitality index being low, going to 20%, we're at 10% today, so doubling that is quite good. Now, our business, though, if we look at the Food Care and Product Care, we just need to accelerate. We have a very stable business, so we don't have that same vitality index of an Apple or of a software company, but we also have the great \u2013 the material to go through all that. So, moving from 10% to 20%, I think, is a pretty aggressive target, and we're putting plans in place to make that happen.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. You may proceed.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Thank you. Just sort of follow-up on Product Care volumes, I guess you mentioned, I think, utility volumes were down 7%, and I guess that's, I think, around 30% of the business. So, is that just kind of saying sort of the rest of the business is kind of, I guess, flat to maybe modestly up? Just kind of any details on sort of volumes in the sort of outside the utility business.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. If we look at the \u2013 we break it up on the utility business, it'd be down. We were actually \u2013 I think I put in my prepared remarks our specialty business is up in low single-digits. And actually, our value-added in the automated space, we're actually up into double-digits. So, we got hit by the \u2013 what we've called the commodity in our utility business in the shrink, is we actually had a year-over-year decline.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","So, our value-added e-commerce business is actually, on a year-to-date basis, up 10%. And that includes our automated systems, our inflatable Bubble Wrap, Korrvu et cetera. So, we're very excited about the year-to-date performance of that business. We do see our shrink business a little bit on the decline. We saw that in Q3. We saw that in Q2. We talked to you about the nature of those particular products relative to shrink that goes around magazines, CDs, DVDs, and so some of that is just the dynamics of the purchasing marketplace there. But we're definitely focusing on our value-added solutions.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","And that shrink business is still roughly 10% of Product Care and is outside of that utility piece, which is 30%. I hope that clarifies that.","Operator, can we move to the next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. You may proceed.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Maybe I missed it, but if I did, apologies to that. Clearly, there's been a shift in strategy in Product Care. Now, you're focusing more on mix price over volume. Like what's behind that shift? Is it a question of returns not high enough, not acceptable? I mean, just trying to get a sense of exactly you're trying to achieve in there and why that major shift in strategy?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. I wouldn't say it's a shift in strategy, raising price on rising cost. That is not the strategy. We need to get the value for what we deliver and we have to work harder on the cost out. So, I really want to separate those two. And that's part of the operational excellence we need to do in the Product Care.","We do think we have an issue with the portfolio where the SKUs that we have a very large portfolio in the product line where we need to take more significant cost out, but we also think we have margin opportunities where we have some extremely highly differentiated products.","So, really want to separate that it's not a price volume strategy. It's get the maximum value we can for our highly differentiated products, but we need to do a better job in taking the cost out of that business. And we need to be more aggressive to make that happen.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","It is very true that you've seen a high price cost spread and mix and a low volume for several quarters. And I think a lot of that can be explained by the strong pricing discipline that we have in both our Product Care business and our Food Care business. And because we have had such a strong discipline, we have seen some weakness on the volume side.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Gabriel Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I was intrigued by the comment about focusing on the channel in which your Product Care, I guess, sales are sold through kind of going direct to customer as opposed to using the distribution channel that's been there for a long time. Can you talk about sort of just what's speaking to you there, Ted in terms of whether it's cost or more opportunity to deeper penetrate customers or what have you?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. I think, I was talking about both businesses sales just for clarity. The Product Care business is 70%-30% going to our distribution channel to direct. Food Care is the opposite, even higher going fully direct. What I was focusing on, when we go through our distribution network, we think we have an opportunity to drive that and really segment that very clearly. Where we have loyal, dedicated, distribution base, we should be able to get a higher penetration and higher value for our products.","We think putting some discipline or more discipline into how we serve our distribution channel, we think we can add value and actually get better margin, and provide better service for our customers. The direct side of the business on the Product Care, that's where the solutions come through. As we're working with our customers, we're talking to different people that are driving the automation. If we're talking to the top level of the business where they want to transform their operations, reduce their labor cost, when they're looking for an automated solution that's a capital intensive decision.","And that's the part that we need to do a better job of to drive our automated solutions in Product Care. But the same thing works in Food Care where we're selling our highly automated solutions to the B2B and to the end-user, is focusing on the capital intensive decision to put in one of our systems but then still maintaining the account where the materials are coming through. So it's for both businesses but for working on our discipline on the distribution is more of a Product Care situation.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, thanks. Yeah, you guys, I guess, have had some headwinds in the form of input costs, and FX, and freight as well. I guess I just wanted to understand in the utility areas, well, why your competitors may not necessarily be seeing as much pressure in those areas, or if they are, what gives them a little bit more ability to be more competitive on price? And are you seeing any changes there over the next year or two or do you think that's still going to be a challenge for you? Thanks.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","I think it's a little \u2013 it's more than saying that it's the competitors. It's really focusing on the markets. If we look at our shrink film which is the one that we've talked about, if you pull that in utility business, the primary markets for shrink film have been markets that have actually been contracting. Selling shrink film to the DVD, CD, magazine wrapping markets have been declining.","So it's not necessarily losing it to the competition, we've got to direct that to a growing market. For instance, anybody who has a box, we can wrap it and use our shrink film to do that significantly at a lower cost. Also the shrink film is what goes into our FloWrap. As we drive our automated solution, we need to go faster with our automated packaging that actually pulls through that shrink film. So, it's not necessarily that we're losing it to competition. We've got to be pointing at the growing markets for those products.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","On the FX, I mean, we have definitely seen some headwinds there. When we rolled out our guidance for the full year of 2018 from a total company basis, we saw that we were going to have tailwinds in FX at the adjusted EBITDA level of $20 million. Now it's headwinds of $10 million. So that's basically a $30 million swing from a total company perspective that we've seen on FX alone. We've basically seen the market, applying some increases in resin prices as well.","And one significant cost for us has been our freight cost. And even though we did go out with a price increase in April of 2018 in our Product Care business, freight costs have continued to increase for both Food Care and Product Care, and we've had a much more pronounced impact as far as the increase on freight \u2013 freight cost within our Product Care business than we have in our Food Care.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator, can we move to the next question, please?","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may proceed.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Molly? George? Operator, I think we have one more question in queue maybe or two.","Operator","And we have another follow-up question from Scott Gaffner with Barclays. You may proceed.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just two quick things. One, Ted, if I look back at 2011, new product vitality for the company was something closer to 17%, you're saying today it's now 10%. So, can you sort of bridge what's happened? I know you weren't there the whole time, but what led us to 17% \u2013 from 17% down to 10%.","And then within Product Care, it seems like there's been significant consolidation on that commodity utility side of the business. How has the overall competitive landscape really changed within Product Care? Thanks.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. So we probably need to go offline on the \u2013 when I went back to 2010, I took it out of Diversey. So we got to be careful what's in there for Diversey and what's in there for the rest of the company. The 2010 is where I was taking some of the analytics for, but the current state of where we are, right or wrong, is in that 10% what we have for the vitality index. So I can't comment to what was in the previous years you had is what we're dealing with right now, and what we've got to go fix.","And the second part of your question, Scott?","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure, it's really on Product Care and the level of consolidation that we've seen away from Sealed Air. I think there's been a lot of consolidation in some of the more commodity utility players within the industry. Has that significantly changed the competitive landscape within Product Care?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","I think so, yes. And that's again why we got to get our costs right, so we can compete. If we can't get the differentiated value for our products, we got to take the cost out to go get that in that part of the space. But also, we need to work with \u2013 we have a pretty strong channel with our distributors. We need to work to make sure \u2013 to find out what we need to do to get that business. If it is a cost-based business, we're going to take our cost and be competitive there. But also, I truly believe it's part of that automation side that we have some opportunities to fix (49:36).","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Ted.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and....","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Go ahead operator, sorry about that.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for attending today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I will now turn the conference over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I'd like remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliations to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.","Please note that we will end the call by 11 a.m. today. Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO, who is traveling internationally and joining us remotely today. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. At this point, I'm sure that you have had a chance to review our press release and earnings results for the first quarter. Our first quarter performance is a true testament to what we are becoming: a company focused on helping our customers win through differentiated solutions and who shares in the value that we create. Including in our operating standard is the necessity to pass on our raw material cost increases in a timely manner. In addition to recovering inflationary costs, the results of our customer value creation approach also shows in the improving quality of our earnings. While there is always room for improvement and there is still plenty of work to do, we outperformed on most, if not all, of our key metrics in the first quarter. We are in the early stages of becoming a knowledge-based company, and I am confident that we are -- and we have the right strategy in place.","Now I want to make you aware of an enhancement that we are implementing on our quarterly earnings releases. From time to time, we would like to give our division presidents the opportunity to speak with you on a more routine basis regarding their business, key trends and targeted performance metrics. And as always, Carol will provide a review of our financial results. For today's call, I have invited Karl Deily, President of our Food Care division, to provide you with a detailed update on our Food Care and highlight Product Care and Diversey Care performance. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, Carol and Karl will be available for questions.","With that, let's get started with an overview of our financial results presented by Carol. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome. Let's start with our performance by region for the first quarter, which you will find on Slide 4 of our presentation. I will highlight sales trends on a constant dollar basis as compared to last year. Latin America and Asia, Middle East, Africa and Turkey, or our AMAT region, continued to be our fastest-growing region, with growth of 10% and 7% respectively. North America sales were up 3.5% with favorable price\/mix in each of our 3 core divisions. In Europe, our focus on quality of earnings and eliminating low-margin business resulted in a net sales decline of 2%. We experienced single-digit declines in France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland, which was partially offset by a 4% increase in Spain and relatively flat sales in the U.K. The 6 countries I just referenced accounted for approximately 20% of first quarter sales. Sales in Japan, Australia and New Zealand were a slight -- a little over 1%, which was led by a 2% increase in New Zealand and a 13% increase in Japan, albeit off of a small base. This increase was partially offset by a 2% decline in Australia.","On Slide 4, we -- Slide 5, we outline our price\/mix, volume trends and sales growth on a constant dollar basis by division and by region. As you can see from the slide, we have positive price\/mix in every division and in every region. You can see our pricing efforts coming through, particularly in North America and Latin America. In North America, Latin America and AMAT, we experienced favorable price\/mix across all divisions. This has been a tremendous effort, and we are extremely pleased with these results. It is worth noting that in Latin America and AMAT, we have experienced -- implemented price increases to address inflation, as well as to offset currency devaluation. Given the economic environment in Europe, we have not made as much progress implementing pricing initiatives as we have had in other regions. While in the first quarter, we had a slightly favorable price\/mix in Europe, we have implemented additional pricing actions in Q1, the results of which we expect to see in the coming months.","Our overall volume declined slightly compared to last year. Karl will cover these trends in more detail. But at a high level, Food Care volume in the quarter was relatively unchanged compared to 2013 despite the fresh red meat market being down approximately 3% to 4% in North America and Europe. Product Care volume, which was also essentially unchanged from the prior year, was negatively impacted by rationalization and unfavorable weather conditions in North America. The decline in Diversey Care volume was due largely to our efforts to eliminate low-margin business.","Turning to Slide 6. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales bridge, positive price\/mix of $62 million in the quarter was offset by a slight decline in volume. Unfavorable currency translation of $52 million was mostly due to the currency weakness in Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Turkey in the first quarter 2014, as compared to Q1 2013.","For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on a year-over-year basis to $252 million or 13.8% of net sales. We delivered 160 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and 110 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin. And within each of our divisions, we had both gross margin and EBITDA margin expansion. For the total company, the increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to favorable mix and price\/cost spread of $36 million partially offset by negative volumes of $9 million. Cost synergies of $24 million were more than offset by $21 million of higher SG&A and other expenses, as well as $8 million of unfavorable currency.","Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.33 as compared to $0.23 in the first quarter last year. The adjusted tax rate for Q1 2014 was 21.4% and includes favorable tax settlement in foreign jurisdictions.","Now I would like to pass the call to Karl, who will provide a detailed review of Food Care results and recap Diversey Care and Product Care performance for the quarter. Karl?","Karl R. Deily","Thank you, Carol. It's a pleasure to be with you today and join you on the call. I'd like to turn our attention to Slide 7, where I'll begin with Food Care, and Food Care sales increased 4% in constant dollars, with approximately 4% growth in both packaging and hygiene segments. As Carol indicated, Latin America and AMAT continued to be our fastest-growing regions. This growth is attributable to overall market growth, customer adoption of our innovative products and our pricing disciplines within these regions. As we look ahead, while we expect overall beef production to moderate in Latin America and AMAT over time, we have a very strong market leadership position and believe we will continue to experience healthy growth rates. We are penetrating these markets with our value-added solutions and services and experiencing better pricing.","In Europe, our constant dollar net sales were relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. These results outperformed the protein market, which was down approximately 3%. While the European economy appears to be stabilizing, the lack of GDP growth and flat to declining protein market continues to make it a challenging business environment. Despite the negative market environment, we are still focused on recovering our increased input costs. While we reported a slight increase in price\/mix in quarter 1, it was not enough to cover the raw material cost increases that we've incurred over the last few years, and the reason why we went ahead and implemented additional increases in the first quarter of this year.","Japan, Australia, New Zealand sales were relatively unchanged with 3% growth in New Zealand offset by a 3% decline in Australia. The decline in Australia was predominantly due to pruning of low-margin businesses offsetting favorable market conditions. In North America, the fresh red meat market declined more than 5% in the quarter, with cattle slaughter rates down approximately 5.2% and hog slaughter rates down approximately 4% to 5%. Despite these unfavorable market trends, our business in North America delivered constant dollar net sales growth of 5% due to favorable price\/mix on relatively flat volumes. We just started seeing the porcine epidemic diarrhea, or PED virus, negatively impacting pork production in March in North America, and it is not expected to subside until end of the year.","Going forward, in North America and Europe, we continue to experience single-digit declines in beef production. To date, we have done a very good job offsetting these declines with a more favorable product mix, better pricing and new product introductions, and we will continue this effort. With that said, we are anticipating a larger impact in North America and Mexico from the PED virus in the second and third quarters, as a result of continued declines in pigs per litter. For the full year, industry experts are estimating a reduction in the range of 1% to 7%, with the largest impact expected over the next 3 to 6 months.","I want to briefly highlight the EBITDA margin performance in the first quarter for Food Care. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points to 17.6% compared to last year. This increase was largely attributable to price increases and adoption of our innovative product portfolio. While we delivered 9.5% year-over-year growth in the first quarter, the volume challenges in the beef and pork markets will negatively impact our business in the coming months. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA is only expected to be up slightly next quarter, as compared to the second quarter of last year. For the full year, we are anticipating EBITDA growth and margin expansion.","I would like to now comment on our performance in Diversey Care and Product Care, and if you turn to Slide 8, I will start with the Diversey Care division. The highlights -- the results from our Diversey Care division show net sales on a constant currency basis were up 1%. Favorable price\/mix of 3.2% was offset by a 2% decline in volume. We have made progress exiting low-margin business, particularly in Europe, where we experienced a 3% net sales decline on a constant dollar basis. This decline was offset by strong performance in developing regions, with an 8% increase in constant currency sales. This was led by double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and Latin America. We also delivered 2% constant dollar growth in North America despite a difficult shipping environment due to unfavorable weather conditions this winter.","While we are focusing on customer rationalization and realigning our cost structure, we are also making targeted investments that will further differentiate Diversey Care's product offer in the marketplace. It's worth noting that during the first quarter, Diversey Care's innovative dishwashing product offer, Suma Combi, was recognized by Tomorrow's Cleaning magazine. It's a leading publication in the hygiene sector in the United Kingdom, where we won Best Product 2014 award.","Diversey Care's adjusted EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points to 8.8% of sales. This improvement was primarily attributable to a more favorable customer mix and improved pricing. Favorable mix and price\/cost spread and synergies were offset by lower volumes, higher SG&A and negative currency translation.","Looking ahead for Diversey Care, we continue to expect healthy growth in Eastern Europe, Latin America and AMAT. In North America, we expect our sales trend to be more balanced throughout the year, as compared to 2013, when we had a strong second quarter due to a significant buy-in from the distribution channel. In Europe, we are planning for volume declines, as we continue to focus on improving the quality of the business in a market environment that is not experiencing much GDP growth and the public-sector spending is constrained, especially in machines and tools.","So if you turn to Slide 9, I'll now cover Product Care. Product Care delivered 3% constant currency sales growth with favorable price\/mix of 2.1% and a slight uptick in volume. Constant currency sales in North America increased 2%, and Europe was essentially unchanged compared to last year. In North America, the 2% sales growth was driven by favorable price\/mix of 4.2%. This was partially offset by a 2.4% decline in volume. We are seeing an increase in demand from our e-commerce and third-party logistics customers for our packaging systems and cushioning solutions, such as Instapak inflatable bubble and fill air solutions. Growth in packaging systems and cushioning were partially offset by declines in general use, which was negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions and rationalization. In Europe, relatively flat net sales were due to a slight uptick in volume, offset by an unfavorable product mix.","Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.8% was up 160 basis points compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $70 million. This improvement was driven by favorable mix and price\/cost spread, as well as cost synergies. While the Product Care team has made great progress over the last 3 to 5 months recovering raw material increases and improving the mix in North America, we still have plenty of work to do on this front, as raw material costs in 2014 are expected to be higher as compared to last year and are expected to continue to increase over the next few years.","As we look ahead, the Product Care team has an objective of more than recovering raw material increases in order to be able to reinvest in future growth opportunities and innovation. We will continue to focus on providing our customers with automated value-added solutions that lower the cost per pack, reduce damage cost and minimize freight cost. Our volume will be further impacted by our rationalization efforts. However, we expect to offset lower volumes with an improvement in mix and better pricing.","Let me now pass the call back to Carol to review cash flow, liquidity and our outlook. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Karl. I will now refer to Slide 10. As a reminder, we funded the W.R. Grace Settlement and related accrued interest with $555 million of accumulated cash and cash equivalents and $375 million from committed credit facilities. Free cash flow, excluding the settlement agreement, was a use of $36 million for the quarter. This compares favorably to a use of $63 million in the first 3 months of 2013, due to our improvement in earnings. Working capital as a percent of net trade sales improved from 19% at March 31, 2013 to 17% at March 31, 2014, which is consistent with where we ended the year 2013.","CapEx in the quarter was $28 million. We expect capital expenditures to increase throughout the year, and at this time, are still estimating the full year to reach $170 million. Cash restructuring costs were $27 million. We estimate cash restructuring charges to be $150 million in 2014.","Cash payments related to SARs were $14 million in the quarter compared with $17 million in Q1 2013.","For the year, we have increased our free cash flow outlook to $425 million from the previous guided $410 million. Our primary use for free cash flow generation continues to be focused on reducing leverage.","On Slide 11, we present our total liquidity post the settlement payment, as well as our net debt. I want to briefly discuss our liquidity position and where we expect to be at year end. To partially fund Grace, we used our revolver and accounts receivable securitization facility. We also paid down our $150 million 12% senior notes in February. We expect our liquidity position to improve over the balance of the year as we continue to use our free cash flow to delever. Our first priority for debt repayment is revolver borrowing. Because of our intent and ability to pay down the revolver within the next 12 months, our revolver outstandings are included in current liability despite the fact that they do not mature until September 2016.","Net debt in the quarter increased $61 million to $4.4 billion from the balance at the end of 2013. This increase was a result of net cash used for seasonal inventory growth, annual incentive compensation payments and interest payments.","Our outlook for the full year 2014 is summarized on Slide 12. We are maintaining our forecast for net sales of approximately $7.7 billion, with organic growth of approximately 3% to 4%, which is due to positive trends in both price and volume, offset by rationalization of approximately 1% to 2% and an estimated unfavorable impact of more than 2% from foreign currency translation.","We are also maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. We currently estimate a full year tax rate of 27% compared to the guidance we previously provided of approximately 25%, due to lower income that is now anticipated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates.","We estimate adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of our $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion range. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to improve in each of our 3 divisions as compared to 2013.","The other category includes our medical business and our corporate and unallocated costs. We expect approximately $100 million of net costs in the other category for the full year, as compared with $88 million in net costs for 2013. The increase is primarily attributable to additional investments we are making in core R&D platform technologies, as well as anticipated negative impact from foreign exchange losses.","As I mentioned earlier, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance from $410 million to $425 million to reflect the higher end of our EBITDA range. We still expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $315 million. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $295 million, and cash interest payments are estimated at $280 million.","In summary, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. And I would also like to note that our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for July 30 at 8:30 a.m.","Operator, can you please open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It's still early in the year, but clearly, you're raising your EBITDA forecast versus where you were pointing initially on the midpoint of the range, more bullish on cash flow. Carol, how does that change your view in terms of share buybacks for '14, particularly if your larger shareholders were starting to sell this year?","Carol P. Lowe","So Ghansham, what we'll do -- we're still committed to the 3.5x to 4x leverage. Obviously, with the guidance that we've provided, we will be within that range at the end of the year. And we would -- as we've indicated previously, we would approach the board, once we are within that range for support to return value to shareholders, which could be in the form of dividends or share repurchase. I think it is important just to remind everyone that within our existing credit facilities and notes, we do have a restricted payment basket, which does limit what is available in terms of share repurchase and dividends. So we have to monitor that. We do have -- again, the most restrictive right now would be relative to the revolver, but we do have restrictions as well on certain of the notes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just as we dig a little bit into the free cash flow guidance, which is nice to see that it's up, could you just give us sort of the elements of the what looks to be about a $15 million increase?","Carol P. Lowe","So before, we were kind of midpoint for guidance, Chip, and now we're at the higher end from a free cash flow standpoint. So we were to do the walk from EBITDA, you would look at the $1.070 billion, high end of the guidance, you would -- we have previously communicated that we would expect a noncash profit-sharing expense of $40 million. We would have CapEx, the $170 million I've referenced, as well as cash restructuring charges of $150 million. We've also previously communicated that cash tax payments are expected to be approximately $100 million for the full year, and our interest payments are estimated at approximately $280 million. The net difference to get you to the $425 million is a combination of changes in our working capital, as well as SARs cash payments.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The question I had is on pricing, 2 parts. One, could you comment as to where you're seeing the most significant difficulty? Obviously, you've had a lot of progress, but the most significant difficulty in implementing the new model across your product lines? And then the related point, are you seeing relatively good momentum either on pricing or volume with your foam-in-place businesses?","Karl R. Deily","Okay. Well, I agree with you that we have been very successful. We're doing what we said that we were going to do, and that we have been very effectively moving price in a number of the regions, predominantly in North America. In our AMAT region, we've been able to get price and volume. Australia and New Zealand we've been able to move price. Where we've had the most difficulty is in Europe. And that's where with the environment that we're in, in parts of Europe, it's been most difficult to move the price typically for Product Care and for Food Care. However, we are committed to going back, and we are going back. We have additional pricing actions that we've moved in the first quarter. And we will continue to work those actions, and we are extremely focused on improving the quality of the business and getting paid for the value that we bring to our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on the food packaging side. I know you highlighted the volume issues around beef and I guess an impending issue on pork. I guess I'm wondering, is that -- because of the pricing dynamics around that, where beef prices and pork prices have gone up a lot, while it's hurting you on the volume, is it helping you in terms of being able to get price and maybe up-sell some of your products to maybe offset some of that, just because the value of the product that your customers are moving are so much higher than they had been 1 year or 2 ago?","Karl R. Deily","Well, it's one of those difficult balancing teeter-totter acts. It's difficult to drive price through to the market. I think we heard this morning Chipotle Grill increased their menu prices for the first time in 3 years. So it's not as easy for some of our customers to pass through pricing. But it is definitely, I think, helps the environment to drive both price. And we've have had an accretion of price and mix, especially in our major markets. And it's from just what you said, it's not only driving price, it's driving higher value-added solutions. We've been very effective in leveraging our value proposition into those markets to compensate for the lower production volumes. And obviously, our goal is to help our customers market a lower volume of product so that they can generate greater revenue for themselves. So I think both from providing higher mix value-added solutions as well as just the constrained market is favorable for accretive pricing actions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Al Kabili with Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Carol, I think it was mentioned on the call that the first quarter didn't yet reflect all of the full pricing actions that have been thus far taken. And I was wondering if you could help us quantify what the annual benefit from that -- from the incremental pricing would be that wasn't yet reflected in the first quarter.","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. So Al, the comment largely was related to Europe -- my specific comments. We have had additional pricing increases that were implemented in March that we would expect to see benefit of in the second quarter. However, as we've also noted, we will have offset due to rationalization, and Karl commented specifically about Q2 and potential impact from the protein market. But what I was commenting to was specific in Europe where we've had some price increases, but we -- they've not stuck as much as they have in other regions. So we will be going back in specific geographies and with certain customers where we've not realized as much of an increase to cover our inflationary costs as we should have, as well as addressing underperforming accounts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple -- one question, but it has kind of 2 parts to it. I mean, first, kind of from the perspective of, I think, if we take the high end of your guidance range, that implies $32 million of EBITDA improvement for 2014 versus '13. But yet, after 1Q, you've already got $21 million of that kind of in hand. My question really kind of comes around what changes with the cadence over the balance of the year. Are you possibly anticipating that the pricing that you're putting in place, that the competitive landscape gets more difficult? Or it sounds like you're still anticipating some volume growth. What are the elements that become potentially more challenging that help make that either look very conservative or that are negatives maybe that we're missing?","Carol P. Lowe","So obviously, it's just one quarter that we've got under our belt, and -- but there's still uncertainties ahead. We do have confidence in terms of our EBITDA performance as we commented that we do expect improved EBITDA year-over-year, as well as EBITDA margins. However, as Karl has noted, the PED virus in North America and Mexico will be impacting the protein market for the remainder of the year, predominantly within Q2 and Q3. Within Product Care, staying disciplined on pricing, we do expect further rationalization as we eliminate low-margin business. That has an impact on volume, and we will experience some under-absorption. And that could also be the impact with Food Care with the decline in volumes related to the virus. For Diversey, again, great execution from the team on pricing disciplines, rationalization. They're being very proactive going after very low-margin accounts either to increase them or to exit them from the portfolio. The macroenvironment in Europe is still remaining very challenging, even though we are starting to see a little bit of stabilization. But again they're -- because of some of the higher fixed costs structure, we do have under-absorption relative to that business and it impacts the overall profitability. So again, Europe will be key as we move forward. And again on total for earnings per share, the tax is moving from 25% to 27% also impacts our earnings per share.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The sales bridge in the slide indicates volumes were a $12 million hit year-over-year. And on the EBITDA bridge, volumes were a $9 million hit. And given you've done a lot of voluntary shedding of low-margin business, I guess the decremental margin was maybe a little higher than I expected. So given you had maybe some weakness in red meat or maybe weather, I was wondering if you could just give any color around that and the volume, what volume's really losing?","Carol P. Lowe","So the biggest impact is relative to Diversey. Again, as I just referenced on the prior question, because Diversey is more of a fixed cost structure as it currently stands versus Food Care and Product Care, if you look specifically at their volume impact and out of that $9 million, Diversey accounts for $6 million of it. So again, that's why we say when we get volume and top line growth in Diversey, it falls straight through to the EBITDA. So it's a great opportunity as we continue to see improvement in that business and the Diversey Care team works to align its cost structure. We do expect in the second half of 2014 to see some of -- a greater impact for the alignment of the cost structure for Diversey Care. But that's the primary driver why you see such a big drop from the sales line to the EBITDA line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the Food Care business, I mean, clearly you're making some pretty good progress on the pricing front. Can you just talk about the impact that had on your market share across the key product lines, if any?","Karl R. Deily","Sure, Alex. We don't talk specific market shares. But I think you can see how we have performed above the market, that not only with our pricing, but with the new solutions that we're introducing to our customers, that we've been able to outpace the market. So as we look forward in North America, we've had basically flat volumes. But we have the headwinds of the reduced slaughter rates and the second and third quarter impact of the PED virus on volumes that we're expecting. In Europe, sales have been relatively flat, but there are obviously various dynamics in the European market. And I think we continue to have some losses due to pricing, but we also have had some very great wins, and that's both on the packaging side and the hygiene side of our business. So we continue to manage the markets and our business very closely. And in areas where the markets are growing, like in Europe, there are parts of the market of that are strong, whether it be Russia, U.K., Northern Europe, other markets that are very weak, like Southern Europe, France, Italy, to name just 2. At Latin America, where volumes are dropping a little bit, but they're still improving, what we do is we just very much look at selling new products, penetrating those markets and managing our margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","In 2013, your EBITDA contribution from price\/mix was $41 million. And in this quarter alone, it was $36 million. If you run rate that, you get to close to $150 million this year. What's embedded in your full year EBITDA guidance in terms of the price\/mix contribution, as well as any loss of volume related to those price increases and to the product rationalizations that you talked about earlier?","Carol P. Lowe","In terms of our guidance, what we talked about was the fact that we would have -- so 1% to 3% year-over-year growth versus 2013. And in terms of the rationalization that, that would be -- we have organic growth of 3% to 4%. And that's due to both positive trends in price and volume. We've not split that out specific to the organic growth. And we would have rationalization of 1% to 2%. And again, the foreign currency translation is a meaningful impact on the top line at more than 2% estimated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to focus for a minute on the rationalization. I think kind of like, Carol, on that last answer, you just said that -- hoping [ph] to get that 1% to 2%. But can you talk about the process -- the progress you're making on rationalization? Do you think there's a opportunity to accelerate that and maybe get that done in a 12-month period rather than 18- to 24-month period? And if so, what segments are running ahead of schedule?","Carol P. Lowe","So if -- and Karl can comment specifically on Food Care, as well as provide color for Product Care and Diversey Care. But in general, just to remind everyone, when we talk about rationalization, it is by customer, it's by product, it's by geography. And we are approaching it in a very surgical fashion to make sure -- the first step is to see if we can maintain business by increasing pricing or changing the product offering that we may deliver to a customer to improve the overall quality of earnings that we realize either from a customer or a certain geography and from a product line. So that's the first approach, so that does take time. We are making meaningful progress. It's showing in our earnings results in Q1, as we are improving the quality of our earnings in a meaningful way. We then follow that, if we're not successful, in some of those direct approaches to our customers or with specific product lines, then we have to move to exit. Obviously, we can't just abandon a customer by not supplying them. We have to have it timed correctly because they may have other products that they buy from us, or we may have other support within a certain geography that we have to meet. So we will accelerate as best we can. Obviously, we would prefer to have the improvement in earnings on a quicker basis because that gives us additional cash to reinvest in the business in terms of innovative products that we can bring to market, as well as delevering and getting to a position where we can return value to shareholders. Karl, I don't know if there's anything specific...","Karl R. Deily","Yes, Scott, the only thing I would add is it's a discipline. And it's like quality or safety. I think it's a job that never ends. And hopefully, you get -- make progress on some of the significant dilutive customers, products or countries. But you just continue to work the process, and it is a process. And you could then have a major devaluation like Argentina experienced in January. You focus on that, and you may have other things that ebb and flow. But in general, I think it's an ongoing process, and a discipline. And I think we're becoming much better at it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Margins in Diversey Care was quite strong, but off an easy comp in Q1. How much of the improvement was you walking away from some bleeders? And should we see continued momentum on the margins front? And can you provide an update on the progress in your push in North America?","Carol P. Lowe","So we -- a lot of the progress that we made in Diversey Care was due to exiting very low-margin business. That made a meaningful contribution to the margin improvement. We expect, as we move forward for the balance of the year, as Karl noted, that we will have continued margin improvement for the full year. However, we also referenced the fact that Q2 comps will be a bit challenged because there was a pull forward in Q2 2013 on some sales for the distribution channel that we won't expect to repeat. We expect it to be more normalized in 2014 than it was in 2013, a little bit smoother. In terms of North America, we are making progress. We referenced that our sales were up 2%. And that was despite the fact that it was a very challenging quarter from a weather perspective within North America. So we're pleased with our results. And the team continues to do just a great job executing on its strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","Carol, I was wondering if you could touch on the cash generation next year, as well as the tax refund anticipation from the Grace transaction or solution. You gave us the numbers, the cash used in 2014, yes, with CapEx, restructuring, interest expense. Can you compare that with next year -- or compare next year with this year, rather?","Carol P. Lowe","So we've not provided details for 2015. We have talked about the fact that by 2016, we expect to have $600 million in free cash flow. That was provided during our Analyst Day back in September last year. I will note that as it relates to the refund that we expect to receive due to the Grace Settlement having actually funded that in 2014, that our cash benefit for 2015 is expected to be slightly in excess of $200 million when we file our 2014 return in early 2015.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from John McNulty.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question maybe for Karl, with regard to the customers that may have left because of pricing issues where you've raised price on them, have you -- is it too early yet, or have you seen any indication of them coming back because either competitors have followed through on price or the customers actually realized, \"Hey, you know what, there's more value than we thought. And we're coming back.\" Like, have you seen any trends like that yet? Or again, is it too early to tell?","Karl R. Deily","John, it's probably too early to tell. But we have had some of that occur in Europe on the hygiene side of the business, where we implemented some significant pricing actions to the market, where our margins or our performance just wasn't to our standards. And actually, within 2 or 3 months, 2 of the customers that had left us came back either due to our -- value of our products and services, or the inability of the competitor to supply. So we do believe that we provide great value, as we market our value proposition, that we provide great value to our customers. And we believe when some of them do step away that they will come back.","Operator","Our last question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Bigger picture question for everyone, including Jerome if he's on the line, when we've seen companies go through transformation turnaround programs, call them what you will, usually the first couple of years are where you make the most progress. There's an obvious pricing need that needs to be addressed and gets addressed. There's an obvious cost reduction move that needs to be addressed and gets addressed. And the momentum is good. And then invariably, these strategies for the companies lose momentum in year 3 or 4. How do you -- if you agree with that premise, how are you going to maintain momentum within Sealed Air, as you go -- get past year 1, year 2 in this transformation? Or what specifically are you worried about and what specifically will you do?","Jerome A. Peribere","So let me take that one. Am I on the line?","Carol P. Lowe","Yes, you are.","Jerome A. Peribere","So good question. The -- and this is why we have 2 programs. One is called \"Get Fit\", and it is about -- all I talked about was, for a long time, was a disciplined approach to what needs to get fixed. And yes, we're making faster progress than I originally thought. But I'm not surprised because we have very clear guidelines, very clear metrics, and we are fabulously executing on all of those. But the next step, which we are starting to do, is the famous \"Change the Game.\" And the \"Change the Game\" is a more value-add approach to our customers. And you need to know that in Sealed Air, we have -- we are absolutely obsessed with making our customers win. And winning for our customers is about adding margin to them through value-add solutions, and then we share in the value. And this is a whole program, and of course, we don't want to say too much about that until we launch some of those. But in the 3 divisions that we have, we are very focused in developing those, talking actually right now with some customers about some of those, and this is what is starting now and which is going to gain tremendous momentum over the years, which is why during Investor Day, I was showing you this curve, which was taking us to a certain level of EBITDA towards 2016 and then continuing to grow. And I have very little doubt that this company is going to look very, very different in 3 to 4 years from now because of the \"Change the Game.\" I hope I have answered your question.","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome. And I guess before we wrap up, just to add one thing, to get back to the Rosemarie's question about cash flow, while we can't state whether it would more -- potentially more favorably impact 2015 or '16, we have implemented a special performance award program if we can exceed our cash flow that we've provided to you of $600 million in 2016, as well as exceed goals for 2015 and 2014. So we're implementing -- we've implemented a special program to incent a keen focus in the company and across the entire company to accelerate our cash flow generation, again, helping provide investment for R&D technologies and innovation, as well as to more quickly being able to hopefully delever the company as we move forward and return value to shareholders. And that is referenced in our proxy.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Operator, I'll pass the call back to you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

This call is being recorded. Leading the call today, Jerome A. Peribere, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carol P. Lowe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Chaitman.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, and thank you and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which were applied to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP.

Now I will turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. Our comments today will focus on third quarter results and our outlook. But before I get started, I want to briefly highlight our Analyst Day that took place on September 20. And for those of you who couldn't make it, if you haven't done so already, I would encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website, download the presentation and listen to the replay.","To quickly recap, we outlined our long-term financial and operational objectives for 2016 and how we are committed to meeting or exceeding those objectives. We spent a great deal of time talking about the new Sealed Air and how we are driving financial and operational excellence and improving the quality of our business. We talked about our sales and value initiatives, as well as our pricing discipline. We also talked about our targeted innovation road map and improving our return on investments. You will hear us reference themes from the Analyst Day on today's call, as each quarter is one step on our journey to becoming a knowledge-based company. And I'm pleased to confirm that our third quarter was a good one in our transformation. The tip of the iceberg is our new logo and tagline, Re-Imagine, because we re-imagine the industries we serve and that is the way you need to think about us.","With that, let me turn to Slide 4 and get into the details of the third quarter results which are quite -- which we are quite pleased with. Sales were up 2% on a reported basis and up 2.9% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of stock appreciation rights or SARs, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 15%, an increase of 5% compared to last year. The increase in EBITDA was driven by higher volumes, manufacturing efficiencies and ongoing savings initiatives, particularly in our Food Care business. On our pricing front, we had favorable pricing trends in each of our 3 core divisions and in every region, except Europe, which was not enough to offset the increase in raw material costs.","While we had implemented new pricing discipline and certain value initiatives on a global basis, we still have more work to do. This is what I call \"go back to our sales force.\" The actions that we have taken most recently are a direct response to price increases announced by our major petrochemical suppliers in the North American market, especially on polyolefins. We are confident that our pricing initiatives and overall strategy will provide us with what I call \"reinvestment economics,\" or in other words, to obtain a return on invested capital above our weighted average cost of capital.","Slide 5 of our presentation highlights our top line results by region. We continue to see solid growth in AMAT where we had a 10% constant dollar sales growth in the third quarter and on a year-to-year basis. In Latin America, we achieved 9% constant dollar sales growth in this past quarter. And developing region in total increased 9% and accounted for approximately 26% of our sales. On a constant currency basis, we experienced double-digit sales growth in Argentina and Turkey, with high single-digit growth in Russia, China and Brazil. In North America, we increased our sales 2%, while Europe was essentially flat. Economic conditions in Europe are still soft with most of the major countries we serve declining in the low single-digits. To be more specific, Germany, Italy, Holland and Spain all declined between 1% and 2% range -- about 1% and 2%, and France declined approximately 5%. The U.K. was the only major Western European country that delivered sales growth at a constant currency rate of approximately 3%. These trends are all consistent with the rates of decline that we experienced last quarter. These 6 countries combined accounted for approximately 22% of our third quarter sales. And in Japan, Australia and New Zealand, we still increased slightly. Australia and New Zealand were essentially flat on a constant currency basis, but results in New Zealand significantly improved from the 10% decline we experienced last quarter due to the positive impact of more favorable weather conditions in the dairy market.","And turning to Slide 6. Food Care sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis, with approximately 3% growth in packaging and 4% growth in hygiene. Regionally, in AMAT and in Latin America, we continue to benefit from increased hygiene standards, rising beef production, a strong customer acceptance of our innovative products and solutions. In the third quarter, beef production rates in Latin America and AMAT were on the high single-digit, low double-digit ranges, and we expect to see these growth trends to continue into the year.","Latin America sales increased approximately 9%, with Argentina contributing 26% growth and Brazil contributing 9% growth. In AMAT, we achieved 11% constant currency growth, with an increase of more than 20% in China and approximately 10% growth in both Africa and Turkey. And in North America, constant currency sales increased approximately 3%, while in Europe, we experienced a 1% decline. From a total market perspective, in the third quarter, beef production declined by nearly 2% in North America and approximately 3% in Europe, hence, our strong performance. We expect declining trends in these regions in beef production to continue through year end and in 2014. And these -- during these down cycles, we have a focus on gaining additional traction with our value-added solutions such as case-ready and Grip & Tear application. This strategy has enabled us to improve the quality of our business.","As we look ahead for our Food Care business, we are seeing early indications that we expect to have a positive impact on our business over the long term. Crop conditions have been favorable and corn prices have come down, and these trends translate into increased protein production over time. Poultry, typically, is the first market to be positively impacted, and production is already up approximately 2% since the beginning of the third quarter, followed by hog production.","And finally, I want to briefly highlight the EBITDA margin performance that Food Care delivered in the quarter. Excluding the impact of SARs, EBITDA margin increased 100 basis points to 16.1% from 15.1% last year. The margin expansion was primarily driven by higher volumes, manufacturing efficiencies and cost synergies. And as we have discussed for many months now, our sales efforts are focused on bringing value-added solutions to our customers and selling higher-performance products such as the products that I mentioned a minute ago.","Slide 7 highlights the results from our Diversey Care business. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 1.6%, driven by strong performance from the developing regions, including Eastern Europe. While our overall top line performance was impacted by continuing soft economy in Western Europe and negative volume trends in North America, which I will discuss in a moment, we did see better pricing discipline globally and a healthy win-loss ratio in the quarter. We also had strong performance in the retail, food service and health care sectors. And on a regional basis, constant currency sales growth was in the range of 10% to 12% in Eastern Europe, Latin America and AMAT. We saw strength across all end markets and throughout the distribution channel.","In Latin America, we were driven by continued strength in Brazil, which increased 8%, and Argentina, which increased 32% and 9% on a reported basis. Strength in AMAT was driven by 11% growth in Turkey, 14% in the Middle East and 20% in Africa. And this was achieved with China essentially flat compared to last year this quarter, as our business was negatively impacted by lower government spending and declines in consumer traffic in international food service markets.","In North America, sales declined 3% compared to last year. During the quarter, there was destocking in the distribution channel, and floor care sales declined in the government and education sector as some of our customers tightened their budgets. We believe that our distributors' inventories have returned to normal levels. And as a result, you should expect fourth quarter volume in North America to improve.","In Europe, which accounts for almost half of Diversey Care sales, we reported a 1% decline in constant currency, which is in line with what we experienced last quarter on a year-over-year basis. Our business is still challenged with single-digit declines in most countries throughout Western Europe, except for the U.K., where we had 2% constant currency sales growth. Continued weakness in Western Europe was partially offset by strong performance that we mentioned earlier in Eastern Europe.","Adjusted EBITDA margins, excluding the impact of SARs, was 10.6%. The lower-than-anticipated volume in North America and some unusual items negatively impacted margins including bad debt, which Carol will address in her remarks. We are very focused on improving the earnings quality of this division, including the implementation of our ongoing cost savings initiatives and our efforts to eliminate bleeders.","And turning to Slide 8. Product Care delivered 4% constant currency sales growth, with 4% growth in North America and approximately 3% growth in Europe. We had low single-digit growth in Germany, the U.K. and Italy, which was partially offset again by a 6% decline in France. These year-over-year trends in Europe are an improvement from last quarter, but we still do not expect the macro environment to change much heading into year end. And in terms of pricing and product mix, we are making progress, as you can see from the positive price\/mix spread we delivered in the third quarter as compared to a negative 2% we reported last quarter. This is a direct result of our decision to walk away from low job margin businesses, hold firm on our pricing strategy and focus on growing our packaging systems and cushioning businesses. While this is encouraging, we are still not capturing enough on price to offset raw material increases and have a more positive impact on our margins, and this is becoming a strong priority for us.","And now, with this, I will turn the call over to Carol to provide additional comments on the third quarter and outlook for 2013.","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. If you are following along with our presentation, Slide 10 provides a bridge for the 2% year-over-year net sales growth. Volumes contributed $26 million. Price\/mix was $28 million positive, driven by favorable trends in all divisions. Currency translation was $15 million unfavorable, primarily due to declines in Latin American currency and most notably, in Argentina and Brazil, which declined 17% and 10%, respectively.","Slide 11 reflects the adjusted EBITDA bridge from third quarter 2012 to third quarter 2013. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to $22 million in cost synergies and $9 million of higher volume. Unfavorable SG&A and other of $16 million includes $9 million of compensation and benefits inflation and a few specific items in Diversey Care, including a $4 million bad debt reserve related to a large customer in our AMAT region, as well as a $2.5 million increase in our inventory obsolescence. As Jerome mentioned, price\/mix was favorable on the top line, but it was not enough to fully offset the increase in raw materials cost.","I want to take a minute to speak to how Sealed Air is implementing stronger credit and collection policies, enhanced customer credit risk reviews and increasing reviews and approvals required for contracts that include rebates and related items. Earlier this year, we named a new Global Director of Credit and Collection, who is implementing best practices across the company and upgrading the risk management talent. We are also now holding our commercial teams accountable for timely collection of customer payments and for bad debt exposure. This is a very important part of Sealed Air Getting Fit.","SARs expense was $9 million in the quarter as compared to $3 million for the third quarter last year. While the amount of SARs expense is not linear with the change in value of Sealed Air's stock price, based on the current number of SARs outstanding, we estimate that every $1 change in Sealed Air's stock price impacts our EBITDA by approximately $1 million. As of September 30, we had $1.3 million SARs outstanding, of which $1.2 million were unvested. The $1.2 million vests as follows: $400,000 on December 31, 2013; $500,000 in 2014; and the remainder in the first quarter of 2015. Based on recent experience, we would expect a large portion of the SARs to be exercised within a few months of their vesting date.","Now turning to Slide 12. For the 9 months ending September 30, we generated $195 million of free cash flow, a $228 million improvement over the first 9 months of 2012. The significant improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to higher net earnings, improvement in certain working capital balances and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher SARs payments. CapEx in the first 9 months of 2013 was $80 million compared with $98 million for the same period a year ago. SARs payments totaled approximately $43 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, as compared with $23 million for the same period in 2012. Our primary use for free cash flow generation continues to be focused on reducing leverage.","Our outlook for the full year 2013 is summarized on Slide 13. Net sales are expected to be approximately $7.7 billion, or at the low end of the $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion range previously provided. Year-to-date, currency has negatively impacted our net sales by $53 million.","We are raising our guidance for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Based on our third quarter earnings performance and our expectations heading into year end, we now estimate adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1.055 billion versus our previous guidance of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion. Adjusted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30. This compares to our previous guidance of $1.10 to $1.20.","The increased outlook for adjusted earnings per share is due to the increased estimate for adjusted EBITDA, reduced depreciation and amortization and a lower anticipated effective tax rate. We now expect our core tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 23% for the full year. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter and for the full year is a result of a favorable mix of earnings in certain jurisdictions with lower tax rate.","Year-to-date, depreciation and amortization was $232 million. For the full year, we now estimate D&A to be approximately $310 million.","There is no change to our outlook for the noncash profit-sharing expense of $40 million and interest expense of $355 million, which includes approximately $290 million of cash interest expense.","Our full year free cash flow is now estimated to be approximately $375 million. This compares with $280 million for the full year 2012 and our previous guidance of $275 million to $325 million. The increase in free cash flow expectations is primarily driven by higher net earnings and lower capital expenditures.","CapEx is currently estimated to be approximately $130 million and includes $25 million in restructuring capital. The lower CapEx guidance is due to our conscious decision to begin projects in the second half of this year in order to manage cash flow due to economic uncertainties we saw in the early part of 2013. While we have pushed to accelerate these projects in the second half of the year, we now have more clarity on timing, and some of these projects will not be able to be completed until 2014.","Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be approximately $140 million. However, as we've shared in the past, timing of execution of certain restructuring activities can be very uncertain, especially in Europe. Cash taxes are estimated to be approximately $100 million.","While we are not providing guidance for 2014 at this time, based on current estimates, we are forecasting 2014 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million and CapEx to be in the range of $180 million to $200 million, including the carryover of certain 2013 CapEx projects. Our cash interest is estimated to be approximately $270 million in 2014. Cash taxes are estimated to be approximately $100 million, assuming an effective core tax rate of approximately 25%. 2014 cash restructuring payments are currently estimated to be approximately $130 million.","Now I would like to update you on where things stand with Grace. As most of you know, we are still waiting for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to issue an opinion as to the bank lenders' appeal. We are also waiting until early December to know whether the other appellants will seek an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. Grace previously indicated that it was targeting bankruptcy emergence in Q4 2013. And although it is still possible for Grace to emerge from bankruptcy in 2013, Grace has recently publicly stated that given where things stand with the appellate timetable, it cannot reasonably expect to emerge this year.","As I am sure most of you have read from our public filings, we have negotiated for key protections as part of our settlement agreement concerning the Grace matter, including releases, injunctions and other protections. And the finality of appeals is related to certainty of these protections being preserved. We do not control the appellate timetable, including when or how the Third Circuit will rule on the bank lenders' appeal, whether the parties will seek to appeal any Third Circuit ruling, whether the Supreme Court will take up any of these appeals, or how any ruling on appeal might impact the underlying bankruptcy plan. In any event, as to the total deferred tax assets of approximately $400 million related to the settlement agreement, we have previously disclosed in our 10-Q filings the potential for this asset to be reduced by up to $50 million if Grace does not emerge in 2013. We have been pursuing available options to preserve the full amount of this deferred tax asset, but no assurances can be given that the full amount will be preserved.","And now, I will return the call back to Jerome.","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, thank you very much, Carol. We are -- before I open the call for questions, I'd like to thank all our customers and shareholders for their very strong continued support. I would also like to thank our employees around the world for their commitment to improving the operating financial performance of Sealed Air. We have made tremendous progress in achieving our objectives, but there's still work to be done. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call currently planned for February 6, 2014. Operator, I would like to open the call to any questions from the participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So when I look at the guidance raise that you've given, it looks like a little bit of it is tied to maybe a slightly lower tax rate kind of going into the fourth quarter, but that doesn't look like it accounts for all of it. So I was wondering, Jerome, if you can give us some clarity as to maybe where you're being surprised the most at this point, whether it's on the pricing or the cost-cutting? Or is it just the environment is getting better on the macro front?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, the environment, generally speaking, we haven't seen that it was going -- getting better in North America. We are going to be slightly impacted negatively by the governmental shutdown in -- during Q4 for -- on our governmental businesses, which I mentioned to you earlier at a point in time. So it's not macros. It is we are very diligently moving towards our Get Fit strategy and making very good progress. So it is about discipline. We have a good cost control. We have some volume growth in some of our markets we just talked about, and we are improving on our pricing strategy. I am not satisfied with where we are. There are strong competitive forces, but we're making progress. You saw that we announced a price increase effective November 1. So this is a must for us to achieve in North America. The reason is that we have had priority in cost increases mostly effective September 1. And we can't get them immediately through, but this is why we have announced November 1. We do have also pricing formulas. And in our Food Care business in North America, specifically, there are -- we have quite a lot of business on pricing formula. They have a slight lag. We're going to start seeing the benefits from this, which means that we are, in fact, doing a little bit better in pricing that you can't see at this point in time.","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. All right, and just to add, just one -- a little bit more color to that. As we look at Q4, right now, October total sales are kind of tracking in line with last year's trend. We did finish Q3 a little bit stronger than what we had anticipated even as we were entering the first part of September.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Carol, I think you just addressed this, but I just -- obviously, you reaffirmed your full year guidance at the Analyst Day with 10 days to go in September. So what, I guess, what changed subsequent to that event that you were not expecting? I get this somewhat goes back to the previous question, but was volume better? Was your cost savings tracking better? What specifically improved relative to your expectations?","Carol P. Lowe","So it -- Adam, it was a -- again, we finished September much stronger. July, and actually probably a good portion of August, we were not seeing a lot of favorable trend. And as you look at the information that's provided in the earnings release, you will see that we did perform very strongly from a cost control standpoint and with the synergies. We had $22 million in cost synergies for the quarter, as well as -- and then we've had $75 million year-to-date. So a lot of it is around cost control. But, again, if you look at the year-over-year constant dollar sales growth, that's also pretty favorable compared to what we're seeing in the greater global economy. Unfortunately, we just don't have the ability kind of mid-month to be able to measure and account for all of the cost performance improvements.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You had mentioned earlier that you're putting into place new controls, procedures, accountability for managing credit. Jerome, Carol, could you comment at all on what you're doing to manage pricing implementation and to verify that the price increases that you want to put through and that your sales and marketing folks are saying they're putting through are, in fact, being put through?","Jerome A. Peribere","Great question, George. The -- it is all about discipline. And our organization was very sales driven, as I explained to you from my observations earlier in the year. We are -- we have taken some people and isolated them in the marketing function to make sure that they are in charge of pricing. When I went to school, I learned that marketing was about the 4 Ps. Well, in the B2B business, the 4 Ps become 2, and they're product and price. And that is the job of marketing, and that's what we are reinforcing. So we have identified some people who are clearly accountable to look at our cost, our pricing, and to get those through. So that's what we're doing. We're doing the same with our credit policies. We are -- we have a level of bad debt which is unacceptable. We have a level of past dues which is unacceptable, and we are working very hard at correcting all of these.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Back to the pricing issue, the 4% to 9% announced in North America, the industry has obviously lacked transparency, particularly, in plastics packaging as it relates to formal price increases. So first off, Jerome, is this something that we should expect with more regularity as it sort of is driven by higher polyolefin cost, if they continue? And second, in terms of the overseas markets, when can we expect a comparable strategy there in terms of pricing?","Jerome A. Peribere","So what you saw from the announcement we made is it was dictated by urgency. There's been a retroactive September 1 price increase from the polyolefin producers, and we were in need from -- of urgency to get those things done. I come from industries where those were publicly announced. And I don't see any problem doing this kind of thing and potentially, we'll continue doing this. We have announced to our customers' price increases in the -- in all the sectors last spring. Some of these went to the level that we had announced. Some were partial. This time, we're seeing margin squeeze that we just simply cannot accept. So we are going to go and go strong on those. This is the value that we deserve to get in order to have reinvestment economics, so I am really feeling very strong about this. Now with regards to the other parts of the world, it's just the same. It's the same that we, generally speaking, can have either polyolefin or other type of products' cost increases, and fundamental discipline means that you're going to be passing them onto your customers. This is Step 1. And then according to the value that you create and the uniqueness of your solutions, you need to have margin expansions. That is what I am looking at, and I will measure this through margin expansions in each of our businesses. We have had pricing growth in the U.S., in Europe even, et cetera, et cetera, on the Food Care -- on the Product Care business that you were mentioning earlier. And -- but they're not sufficient to cover what we're going through. And by the way, this is an opportunity to get rid of some of our bleeders. We do have some low-margin businesses, which we either get what we need or we're going to move out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a question on the price increase announcement that was discussed earlier, earlier in the quarter. As you think about your book of business over the next 12 months, how much of that book of business do you expect will benefit in full from the 5% to 9% increase in prices, and how much will take longer than 12 months to actually see the full benefit?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, I cannot wait for 12 months to see the benefits of our announced price increases. I was -- we have obtained some price increases as a result of our spring announcement and -- but not enough and inconsistently. Of course, there are competitive forces and in the Food Care businesses, we lost -- we've been taking a business from a very large international competitor, some business in Australia and New Zealand. We've been taking some business or an account in the U.S. also. Well, that's life. But we are the leader, we need to be leading in this price in pricing discipline. So that's what we are. But 12 months is clearly not acceptable. We just can't wait for 12 months to recover our costs. Remember what I said, we need to -- this is the pricing discipline aspect, which is to recover, by definition, our cost increases. And next to that, we need to be better at analyzing and understanding the value we create for our customers, and as a result of that, to see margin expansions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Manuel with Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask you a question, if I could circle in on Diversey a second, and specifically, when I look at the profit trajectories we work through 3Q, I guess where I'm really trying to go with my question is how this might suggest into 2014? But when I look at the performance here in 3Q, even if I were to adjust for the bad debt expense and the inventory obsolescence and the $1 million you have for -- here for volume, your earnings were still down on a year-over-year basis. What -- I know some of the price increases you've got through look to be more in some of the Food Care and Protective Care pieces. What are you doing specifically within the Diversey piece to improve profitability and help to offset some of the extra impacts, and how might that play out into 2014?","Jerome A. Peribere","Okay. So several things. First of all, my take is that if you exclude SARs and if you exclude this bad debt, and if you include the one-offs, et cetera, we're not doing worse, we're doing slightly better. So that's my view. What we're doing is under the leadership of Ilham, we are -- she has simplified her organization. It's done. She has done that this summer. She is still making business improvements, taking care of bleeders, and she is imposing a much better pricing discipline. There's a lot of work to do. It's not easy, but we are getting there. I am optimistic, actually, from what I'm seeing, that we're getting traction in the marketplace. Our equipment business is doing quite well. We have booked, a few weeks ago, the largest equipment machine order that we ever had, and it's going to be delivered in the coming few months, et cetera. So there are some real good things going on. They need to translate into numbers. It's going to take a little bit of time. But we do have some good wins and some good channels improvements here and there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just curious, Jerome, on your commentary on Europe, you still seem to be maybe a little bit pessimistic on Europe. But if I look at sort of the volume trends in Europe sequentially, European Food plus 1% in 3Q versus minus 1% in 2Q. European Product Care looks like it was up 4% on volumes versus about 2% in 2Q. And in Diversey Care, we seem to be sort of still down about 1.5%. So is it just -- are you being cautious on Europe? Or is there something else going on that leads you to believe that things are going to continue to be relatively flattish in Europe going forward?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, you see, Scott, everything is relative in life. I have read quite a few documents or quite a few articles recently which was saying Europe has turned the corner, et cetera, et cetera. So from a GDP point of view, all we're talking about is moving from 0.4% negative GDP growth to plus 1% or plus 2% -- plus 0.1% or plus 0.2%. So, again, all of this is relative. Do we see positive trends quarter-over-quarter, which means do we see improvements in the third quarter compared to the year-to-date? Yes, we do, except in France. But in the U.K., as I said, we had a year-to-date growth of 1.2% in U.K. and we're moving toward 2.6% in the past quarter. In Italy, we were having a negative growth of about 3%. We're moving to about 1%. In Germany, it is about stable to pretty iffy at this point in time. In France, it's improving. But we've got to hit big time because we were strong in France in Food Care and Product Care also. We've been year-to-date about minus 7%, and we're about minus 5%. And I am well placed to know that the French economy is very iffy and that consumer sentiment is still very poor. In Spain, we're improving. We moved from a minus 3% to a minus 1%. So, yes, things are improving. But it's going to be a long time before European GDP is above 2%. It's going to be a long time because of the importance of government spending, which is in most of those economies around 50% of the total GDP.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jerome, I wonder if you could give us a little more color, kind of in Latin America. When you talked about sort of volume trends, particularly in Argentina and Brazil, but especially Argentina, you were throwing out some big year-over-year gains. And I just wondered if you could put a little more color around that, maybe talk about how sustainable you think that strength is. Historically, those have been pretty volatile markets.","Jerome A. Peribere","Okay. So constant currency growth in Argentina is meaningless when you have 25% devaluation, all right? So what's in this specific country, you need to have -- you need to look at your year-over-year. And we are quite pleased with what's going on, and very bluntly, it is the quality of our people. We've got very, very good people in that country and in Latin America also. So our total growth in Food Care year-to-date has been close to 10%, well, 29% in constant currency. But real, in dollars, in local currency after the devaluation, it's been about 9%, great growth. Our total -- in Diversey Care, we're doing wonderful. And, again, it's the local quality of our people which really make the difference. So then on a total country on Diversey Care, we've been growing double digit year-to-date in dollars. We've been growing over 30% in constant currency, which I said it doesn't mean, but the real number to think about is about 12%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili with Macquarie Research Equities.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","I just wanted to get a little bit into the guidance which implies a $12 million sequential drop in EBITDA. And Carol or Jerome, I think you mentioned you had seen some pretty good momentum. And exiting the third quarter, we've got the price hikes that you've announced for November 1. So I'm just -- if you could just kind of help us with that sequential decline that you're looking for.","Jerome A. Peribere","So a quick comment on this with regards to cost and pricing. Remember that we have our polyolefin cost increase effective September 1, and as announced by -- to the industry. And our price increases are effective November 1 when they're applied. When we have formula pricing, they don't apply. It is the overall trend. So that has a slight negative. Why don't you comment on the one...","Carol P. Lowe","Yes, and, Al, we also -- remember, we have some seasonality where Q2 and Q3 for the total company are typically our strongest quarters. And in Q4, while we do benefit some on our packaging side relative to the holiday season, there's less hospitality that we see on the Diversey side. So we will experience a slight decline going sequentially from quarter-to-quarter due to that seasonality.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.","Phil M. Gresh - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is sort of a follow-up to that one. More on the top line with your guidance of kind of -- or your trends of flattish top line so far in the fourth quarter and your implied guidance being similar to that, I assume pricing is at least the same as the third quarter, if not accelerating, given the increases. So volumes in the third quarter were positive. So I'm wondering where across the portfolio, specific segments, et cetera, you might be seeing the deceleration of the trends? And Carol, if you could very quickly just confirm, in the CapEx for next year, is the full $30 million decline this year carry over into next year? And how much is in the restructuring for CapEx next year?","Carol P. Lowe","So, thank you, Phil. So if we look at just kind of trends as we head into Q4, again, I mentioned that October is kind of tracking in line with last year trends, with obviously, with still 2 months to go. Food, we expect modest growth overall with Latin America and AMAT positive. North America, as Jerome talked about, we do have some negative trends, especially as it relates to the fresh red meat market. He gave you some of that data. We're really not expecting any benefit from Europe to possibly having some downward pressure. Diversey, again, Jerome highlighted all the strong emerging market growth. North America, we do have some risk, especially that might trail from the government shutdown, and we expect it to be flattish. We will have some improvement, we believe, from our distribution channel because the destocking that we experienced in Q3, we don't expect that to continue into Q4, but we're not really expecting a pick up and, again, Western Europe not to provide any momentum. For our Product Care business, we do expect some growth on constant currency. However, we'll have some negative FX that will affect all of the businesses. So that will be an impact. And as we look at CapEx, yes, the $180 million to $200 million does include the $30 million carryover from 2013. And the $180 million to $200 million includes approximately $40 million relative to restructuring capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Ng with Jefferies.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","On the I&L segment, there was a bad debt expense during the quarter. How should we think about that going forward? Will that reverse? And I guess stripping that out, if I look at EBIT margins overall for the full year, it's kind of flattish. Should we expect a more -- a bigger margin improvement next year with the European restructuring kicking in?","Carol P. Lowe","Okay. So let me -- I'll address the -- on the bad debt expense. It was a very unusual situation. It's a specific customer that had grown quite substantially on a year-over-year basis. And as they were trying to manage that growth, they ran into certain issues. We are still pursuing collection of that bad debt. We're awaiting on certain court actions within the specific country on how they will recognize that customer's petition for relief on certain items. So it's a very fluid situation, and it is unusual for us to have that large an amount specific to 1 customer. So we would not expect it to continue. If we're successful in our collection pursuit, then we would be able to reverse that. As far as margins, and Jerome may have some more specific comments, but we do expect Diversey to improve its margins as we move forward, especially in 2014. Because they -- as he's highlighted, we've done a lot in terms of implementing cost synergies, the realignment of the organizational structure. We're really not commenting specifically at the divisional level as to what we expect. But we do expect improvement, just as we do with all of our businesses, to have year-over-year improved performance.","Jerome A. Peribere","Actually, what we need to do, Phil, is to refer to our Investor Day. There is a road map there and it's still intact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","You talked about getting the cost increases via price increases. Could you also touch on what you are doing on your purchasing and whether you could pass through half of what you are getting and then the other half by benefiting from changes you are doing with your suppliers?","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, our objective is to pass, clearly, all of our cost increases. There is no way out. And this is what had mostly affected the performance of Sealed Air over the past few years. And it has reflected in declining EBITDA percentages year-over-year, much too often in our history. So it's a question of discipline. And when we just can't pass those and when we have to accept as a fait accompli, that a given product line has commoditized too much, we need to change the service model. And if it still doesn't work, we need to accept that this is a product line we don't necessarily want to be in. And you've got lifecycles in products and product lines, and you've got to accept them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","At the Analyst Day, you detailed your Earnings Quality Improvement Program, and I was just wondering as we approach 2014, can you give us any updated color on how you would expect the benefits of that program to be distributed between 2014 and 2015? And then when we look at the 2 restructuring programs, in total, is it safe to say, again, that Diversey is going to see the biggest kind of margin improvement as the result of restructuring in 2014?","Carol P. Lowe","So I guess we're not providing any information on 2015 at this time. We did, as it relates to the restructuring programs for Analyst Day, I did break down how we expected the costs to play out for 2013, 2014 and 2015. That's largely stayed the same. Actually, if you look at all of the restructuring, all 3 of the divisions have benefits from the restructuring program. At this time, Food Care and Diversey Care, specific to the restructuring, would be approximately the same benefit. We do -- there are a lot of things for Diversey Care, and they obviously have the greatest possibility for improved margins just because of where their margins currently sit.","Operator","There are no remaining questions in queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jerome Peribere for closing remarks.","Jerome A. Peribere","All right. Well, thank you, all, for your participation and your very good questions on the call today. Confidence that our plan to improve Sealed Air's quality of earnings is underway, and this third quarter performance is a true testament to our leadership team and our employees and their commitments. There is clear direction for our business, and we're confident that we have the right strategy in place, and we are watching quarter after quarter on the progress of this strategy. We focus on providing significant value and innovative solutions to our customers. We need to become more nimble, and we are taking actions towards that and all of this, in order to create our better way for life, which is our vision. Thank you very much. I look forward to talk to you on February 6. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Miss Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you and good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future periods are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release and slide presentation, which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP.

Ted?","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Lori. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, I'm going to start with a recap of our first quarter results, provide an update on the progress we made with Reinvent SEE and then discuss the exciting acquisition of automated packaging systems, which we announced this morning.","Bill will expand on our financial results for the quarter, and then I'll discuss our outlook for 2019, which excludes the impact of the APS transaction.","We expect to close early in the third quarter and update our full year outlook on our second quarter conference call tentatively scheduled for July 31st.","Turning now to our first quarter results. We\u2019re off to a solid start to the year and we\u2019re seeing a positive impact in our financial results, from our Reinvent SEE transformation.","Adjusting earnings per share increased 16% compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% as reported and 10% in constant dollars. We're pleased to report that margins expanded by 130 basis points to 19.4%.","Sales were up 3% in constant dollars on favorable pricing and contribution from the Austin Foam acquisition. While organic volume declined 1% in the quarter, this was against macro headwinds that impacted our business particularly in the industrial sector and a tough year-over-year comparable and protective packaging.","We're working hard to recover volume for the remainder of the year and we'll go after opportunities we see by market, by product, by geography and now with M&A.","We are reinventing the company. We're encouraged by our progress to date. We're now operating as one Sealed Air. We're consolidating and delivering across functions, geographies, and divisions to reduce costs. This will enable us to respond faster to our customers and market needs and drive profitable growth.","We're making changes to our go-to-market strategy to improve the profitability and smaller, yet growing countries. We've implemented our new value capture pricing model. We're rationalizing suppliers and vendors, and realizing operational savings with yield improvements and more to come.","Across our manufacturing network, we're selectively upgrading aged assets, investing in new automation technologies, and partnering to develop Sealed Air\u2019s smart factory processes as we move more aggressively to further automate our global manufacturing network.","We're still in the early days of Reinvent SEE. We're focusing on the dollar impact of our initiatives, change management, and process redesign. As we work to double our innovation rate, and drive profitable growth, we're accelerating our investments in sustainable materials to get ahead of market demand.","This morning, we announced the acquisition of automated packaging systems for $510 million on a cash and debt free basis. This transaction accelerates our innovation and automation and sustainability and is closely aligned with Reinvent SEE.","APS generated sales of $290 million in 2018, an increase of 10% over 2017. We expect the transaction to be accretive to our adjusted EBITDA in 2019.","Let me expand on how automated packaging systems fits into our strategy. We've been looking at APS for over a year and how are they performing in the market? APS is a market leader with unique and innovative solutions, complete with automated equipment, advanced materials, investing class, technical and field service. They have an established track record of growth and innovation through machine automation and integration, supported by a strong patent portfolio.","This will accelerate our Reinvent SEE goal of doubling our innovation rate over the next five years. The combination aligns well with our Reinvent SEE objective to drive channel optimization, while improving customer service.","We believe automated packaging systems will thrive within Sealed Air, given our global reach, distribution network and highly complementary portfolio. We believe, we will learn from automated packaging systems and create cross-selling opportunities to gain access to additional growth in e-commerce, fulfillment and food markets.","In Food, APS serves adjacent packaging segments such e-foods, produce, snack foods in portion controlled meals. We\u2019ll also leverage APS\u2019s engineering and technical service expertise and bring that capability to our customer base around the world.","We\u2019ll generate compelling cost and productivity synergies. These include procurement, extrusion, conversion, materials and network efficiency. We also see synergies with the recycled materials that will benefit our Sealed Air portfolio.","Our strategy for Sealed Air to grow faster than the markets we serve, delivering earnings growth with operating leverage above 40% and have a disciplined ROIC strategy to drive economic value well above our cost of capital.","Our acquisition of APS supports our strategic growth objectives and aligns with our four P's of Reinvent SEE. APS\u2019s success in providing sustainable solutions will help us achieve our sustainability pledge sooner.","I'll now pass the call to Bill review our results in more detail.","Bill Stiehl","Thank you, Ted. As a reminder, we made two reporting changes this quarter. First, Mexico and Central America are now included in our North America region. We provided you with 2018 quarterly sales by region in the appendix of the earnings deck that is available on our Investor Relations website.","Second, price is now being reported as a standalone metric and mix has been included in volume trends. On Slide 8, let\u2019s start with the review of our net sales by region.","In the first quarter, sales declined 2% as reported and increased 3% in constant dollars. North America was up 3% in constant dollars and accounted for nearly 60% of our sales in the first quarter.","Favorable price and contribution from our Austin Foam acquisition were offset by a 2% decline in volume. In Food Care, North America was up 2% on favorable pricing, and positive volume trends.","In Product Care, North America was up 4% also on favorable pricing plus contribution from Austin foam, which was partially offset by a 6% decline in volume.","The decline in volume was due to a tough year-over-year comparable as well as a very soft industrial environment. In Europe, Middle East, and Africa sales declined by 1% in constant dollars. Food Care EMEA was down 2% due to market softness elevated by Brexit concerns.","In Product Care, the market headwinds were offset by new customer wins, which resulted in a 1% increase in sales. APAC was up 3% in constant dollars, largely driven by continued growth in Australia in food packaging and demand for packaged proteins. This was offset by market weakness in protective packaging, primarily in Asia, related to ongoing tariff disputes, and a resulting slowdown in the electronics sector.","South America was up 25% due to U.S. dollar index pricing on relatively flat volume. Slide 9 highlights volume and price trends by division, and by region.","In the first quarter, we delivered favorable price across all regions and in both divisions, due to our value capture pricing model and formula pass through in Food Care, North America.","Food Care delivered favorable volume trends across all regions, except for EMEA, where we experienced a 2% decline. In Product Care, we experienced volume declines in both North America and Asia.","On slide 10, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the first quarter. I covered sales trends in the last two slides. So my comments will focus on EBITDA performance.","Adjusted EBITDA of $216 million increased 10% on a constant dollar basis. Margins were up 130 basis points to 19.4%. We delivered favorable price cost spread of $22 million as a result of actions taken related to our Reinvest SEE strategy, formula pricing and Food Care, North America as well as lower input cost.","This was offset by volume declines that impacted EBITDA by $7 million. We realized $13 million in restructuring savings, which was partially offset by $7 million of higher operating costs, largely related to inflation. Unfavorable currency was $10 million.","For the full year, we are on track to realize $70 million in restructuring savings and expect to continue improving our leverage on organic growth.","Adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter was $0.59 on average diluted shares outstanding of 155 million shares. Our adjusted tax rate was 29% in the first quarter. For the full year 2019, we continue to anticipate a 26% adjusted tax rate reflecting our tax optimization efforts.","Turning to our results by division. On Slide 11, we present first quarter results for Food Care. Food Care sales of $680 million were up 3% in constant dollars.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% in constant dollars to $143 million. Margins in Food Care improved 170 basis points to 21% of net sales. The global protein markets were up slightly in the first quarter. We expect the protein markets to accelerate for the remainder of the year resulting in 2% to 3% growth for the full year. This compares to our full year outlook for Food Care sales of 4% constant dollar growth.","We expect improved, pasture conditions particularly in North America, continued local protein consumption and strengthening of the export market.","Our food packaging business continues to outperform the market due to the strength of our core business and the penetration of our case ready platform. We have the broadest portfolio in case ready applications for all proteins including seafood. We are expanding solutions that can't contain recycled materials. We are also expanding solutions that are post-consumer recyclable. We expect growth and these offerings to continue and have increased our investments in renewable and recyclable processes and materials.","In March, we announced our plans to make a $24 million capital investment at our largest global manufacturing facility in Simpsonville, South Carolina to produce plant-based food packaging. This facility is the first one in North America to produce materials made from plant based resins and post consumer plastic.","We also have been successful penetrating the fluids market and expect this to be a key driver for our growth in 2019 with new customer wins. This growth is directly related to our innovative, vertical pouch packaging platforms, where we are seeing increased demand for conversion of rigid containers to flexible packaging.","For example, our latest FlexPrep system solution integrates equipment, materials and dispensing technologies which we expect to be a key driver for future growth. We are confident Food Care will continue to deliver above market growth rates on the top line while driving strong operating leverage.","On Slide 12, we highlight results from our Product Care division. In the first quarter, Product Care net sales were $433 million and they were up 2% in constant dollars.","Growth in inflatable Bubble Wrap, paper systems and Korrvu were offset by declines in mailers, void fill solutions and some of our industrial applications.","Adjusted EBITDA of $75 million or 17.3% of sales was down slightly on a constant dollar basis. Favorable price cost spread and restructuring savings were essentially offset by the decline in volume and higher operating costs, which weighed on our margin performance in Product Care. We have identified opportunities as part of Reinvent SEE that will improve our Product Care performance including optimizing our go-to-market strategy and simplifying our business to better align with our changing end market dynamics.","In 2019, we expect growth in our differentiated portfolio including inflatable Bubble Wrap, paper systems, Korrvu and automated systems. We continue to work with our B2B customers to modify their packaging and ensure their products are parcel ready.","Our broad product portfolio, including integrated fabrication, specialty foam and Instapak, is well positioned to capitalize on this trend.","As Ted discussed, we are accelerating our investments in both automation and sustainability with our announced acquisition of automated packaging systems.","We are excited to add such an innovative business to our platform and we're confident that APS is highly complementary, and additive capabilities will be a growth driver for Sealed Air.","Let's now turn to our free cash flow for the three months ended March 31st on slide 13. In the first quarter, we generated $16 million in free cash flow compared to a use of cash of $77 million in the same period a year ago.","CapEx was $49 million in the first quarter. Our estimated CapEx budget for the full year remains at $200 million. Restructuring cash payments were $25 million in Q1, and our plan for $115 million in restructuring spend in 2019 is on track.","Net interest payments were $40 million and for the full year, net interest payments are estimated to be $190 million. Cash tax payments were $13 million. We continue to forecast cash tax payments to be $130 million in 2019.","At this point, I will turn the call back over to Ted to discuss our outlook. Ted?","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Bill. Turning to our total company 2019 outlook. We're reaffirming our outlook for the full year. Net sales are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion or 2% growth as reported. On a constant dollar basis, net sales are expected to increase 5% with Food Care up 4% and Product Care up 5.5%.","On an organic basis, we expect Product Care sales to be up 1.5%. We have some work to do on driving our volume for the remainder of the year. We're confident in the opportunities, in our action plans to make this happen.","The focus of Reinvent SEE is to drive profitable growth and innovation. As we reinvent our business, we\u2019re focusing on delivering the best products at the right price and making them sustainable.","Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is expected to be approximately $925 million to $945 million, an increase of approximately 4% to 6%. Our operating leverage is expected to reach 40% target in 2019.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of approximately 6% to 10% compared to the prior year. Our guidance does not assume additional share repurchases for the remainder of the year.","For the full year, we continue to estimate free cash flow to be approximately $250 million. As we noted on our last earnings conference call, our restructuring efforts are behind us -- when our restructuring efforts are behind us, we expect EBITDA to free cash flow conversion to increase over 40% with CapEx of approximately 4% of net sales and an improvement in working capital velocity.","Before we open up the call to your questions, I would like to spend a few minutes on the progress on sustainability. We're leading the packaging industry to a more sustainable future. We committed capital to produce materials made from plant-based resin and post-consumer plastic in our Simpsonville facility. This is one of the world's largest packaging facilities and the first in North America to produce this type of film.","The expansion is underway with planned production scheduled to begin in 2020. Investing in plant based technology, accelerating our work on fully recycled materials and now with our announced acquisition of automated packaging systems, we're expanding our portfolio of recycled content. This brings us closer to the sustainability commitments outlined in our pledge. We are committed to delivering 100% recyclable, or reusable packaging offerings in 50% average recycled content across all packaging solutions by 2025.","Later this month, we'll be attending the Ocean Plastics Leadership Summit, a scientific expedition to understand the problem and opportunity to connect leaders across the plastics ecosystem to eliminate plastic waste. This event is the first of its kind to convene on the Atlantic Ocean, with the purpose of enabling the world's most committed companies and the entire ecosystem to accelerate solutions dedicated to the ocean plastics crisis. We will have the opportunity to network with other leaders, discuss potential partnerships, joint ventures and new innovation initiatives. We look forward to using and learning from this summit, to create new solutions at Sealed Air and lead the change in the packaging industry.","Our objective is to reinvent everything we do, on our own operations and the entire packaging ecosystem. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress throughout the year.","With that, I now open up the call for questions. Hey Valerie, we can begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron. Excuse me; our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Your line is open.","Matthew Krueger","Hi, good morning. It's actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?","Ted Doheny","Good.","Matthew Krueger","So my question is, were the volumes that you saw across your segments in line with your internal expectations for 1Q? And then if so, how should we think about growth for the remainder of the year given that the macro backdrop still seems somewhat choppy. I guess what I'm trying to get at is, what factors give you confidence that you can see kind of a step up in growth in the latter half of 2019?","Ted Doheny","Okay. The first piece, I'm looking at we'll break it up in the product and the Food Care in the first quarter. We did anticipate that we would have tough comparables from year-over-year. We also knew that a year ago we had the currency tailwinds and now going to headwinds.","So the other piece in there on the industrial side, we did see the industrial business take a step down in the quarter. So our confidence on the second half of the year is we do think we have some volume that was short in the first quarter we think we can make up in the second half of the year.","On the Food Care side, we do see that we gained a little bit on the markets, and we're still confident that we can beat that 4% growth that we had in the second half of the year. So we feel pretty good on the volume side, on the Food Care.","Matthew Krueger","Okay. That's helpful.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please. Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citi. Your line is open.","Bryan Burgmeier","Hi, this is actually Brian Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. I was just wondering if you can provide any context on the margin profile of APS relative to Product Care and any detail you can share of potential synergies would be helpful as well.","Ted Doheny","Okay. Well, I'll give you an overview. First of all, we've been looking at this business for well over a year. We're excited as their title suggests automated packaging systems. That's what we see that markets are going in automation. As far as the profit profile, we\u2019ll share at closing. We've got a couple of months out there. But just to give you guys, we're looking at businesses actually below our multiple, and the synergies that we're looking at over the next three years, we think this will hit our guard rails on our ROIC.","So it will be north -- double-digit in ROIC post synergies what we liked about it is one, getting to know the culture, the people, we don't have in the marketplace. But is there a full system on the automation, where they actually make the equipment, they actually load the bags, their iconic Autobag. So they have the material, the equipment, in the full system, and also what we liked is their service footprint. They have a very strong loyal customer base that we looked at.","So we think, we could not only help them do what they do, but they can help us. Looking at the other synergies of what we can do on the cost base with Reinvent SEE, we're pretty excited that we think we can bring some cost synergies to the profile. So it fits well strategically, culturally, it feels right. We think, we could learn from them, and we think we can help them. And we also like the fact that they grew 10% last year. So there, it\u2019s a good strong business, profitable business, family owned business. So lots of pauses and we're pretty excited about it.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Staphos of Bank of America. Your line is open.","George Staphos","Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question and the details. Good morning. Ted, I just want to come back to the volume trend and Product Care. Look, we know the comparison was challenging and we appreciate that, but it does seem like industrial has been this nagging issue for the company for a while. You know piggyback on the last question or two. What volume to the extent that you can comment do you have in hand right now, that makes you feel comfortable you can hit your higher volume goals and then the resulting incremental margin goals? Is it in hand or you have targets that you have to now go and get it? Thank you.","Ted Doheny","Well, I'll end with your first one, yes. We have our go-get targets that actually feel pretty good about that we get. But just to re-in -- I just want to reconfirm what's going on in the Product Care. We actually did see very strong growth in our inflatable Bubble Wrap. Also in our core view, and also in our paper systems, we did have a tough year-over-year comparable and the tough issue was mailers, and we'll talk about we got some exciting things working on mailers.","But we -- the other piece in there that we didn't anticipate was the industrial slowdown in the first quarter, and that affects our Instapak. The Instapak business though, and trending in the quarter, we saw it pick up in the last month. So we see the equipment installed. So there's definitely a lead and lag on that. So that gives us confidence that we do see that industrial piece coming back and we have a very strong market share and we think we can recover that.","The other piece on the mailers and it's a common theme and why I'm talking so much about sustainability. We believe, we can recapture some of that mailer market share this year with a sustainable product. We're aggressively working on a recycled product that we think now the team's target is over 12 months but we're asking them to aggressively see what we can do to have a fully recyclable mailer content into the Bubble Wrap line.","And we think, we could create growth. So just giving an example of one of the projects in place, but we've got some work to do but we think we can recover that volume in our protective packaging businesses.","George Staphos","[Indiscernible]","Ted Doheny","Oh, so I said it\u2019s focused on the Product Care.","George Staphos","I think there is potential bit of [Indiscernible] on the Food Care.","Ted Doheny","Sure. And on the Food Care, where I'm always correcting when I get asked the question, I think, we have a tremendous growth opportunity there. With our iconic Cryovac in some of the products that we have going there.","So in the first quarter, we did have some issues in Europe with Brexit. So we didn't get the volumes there that we thought. We did see good penetration still our growth in North America. On the second half of the year, we do think we have penetration in our core market in our Darfresh product line, the case-ready and pretty much all the protein markets around the world.","The first half of the year, we're anticipating strong growth in Australia the second half. We think that will be tempered down. But again, on the sustainability side, we had the full team over in Europe last month at our new platform in Italy, and we got to see the Darfresh line that we're now upto 40%, 94% recycled content in Darfresh and the European market that is really really a big deal on sustainability.","So we think, we can get not only our market share, we can gain market share in food, so we can think we can hit that growth target for the second half of the year.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Ted, I was going to ask you a question about resin costs, but I know you don't like to talk about resin. So I'll ask one on pricing instead. So what, I mean your pricing was quite solid. Why were prices going up when resins are going down?","And is there any relationship between the higher price we saw and the volume softness that we also saw in there?","Ted Doheny","I don't think so. And by the way, Edlain, I appreciate because each time now you're opening that you talk, that I don't like to talk about resin, but you keep talking about it. So that is good.","As far as the -- the resin piece in our quarter. We've probably got a couple million uplift with what's going on in the resin. The price -- the cost piece that we made the quarter was really more related to reinvent and what we're doing, and actually, more just getting a better price on resin. We're working quite aggressively with multiple resin suppliers. Bill can actually give you more detail on that. We'll go through some of the Reinvent SEE pieces.","But as far as the pricing piece and raising price and losing volume, do not think that's an issue at all with the resin. We think, we have more cost side going upside potential for the rest of the year. Our outlook on resin, we do, did see that a resin pricing in the first quarter, but our outlook for the year, it's still flattish. So that does mean if we have other opportunities with resin going down, we have upside on the cost side for the year. But our outlook, our guidance right now has a flat resin story for us.","So if it continues to go down, we have upside, but we think we have upside already from what we're working on in Reinvent SEE.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Gaffner of Barclays. Your line is open.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Morning Ted. Good morning Bill.","Ted Doheny","Hi, Scott.","Scott Gaffner","Nice to come back at Product Care, but I think that was the area where there was the most variation relative to people's estimates. Ted, if I look at it, you know that you're saying 1.5% organic growth for that business before you'd said 1%. So it seems like maybe you're even more confident in that segment. Now, can you talk about the growth on a go-forward basis, is it at least in 2019, is it recapture of some of these industrial businesses, or is it more growth in the high value segment at least in 2019 that we should be anticipating and based on that, do you still think you can get segment EBITDA up year-over-year despite some of these challenges.","Ted Doheny","Well Scott, let me break it up in two pieces because you threw in segment EBITDA in there on the growth. The EBITDA, pretty confident we're going to get that. We're focused pretty hard on the cost and the efficiencies that we've talked about. On the volume side, is just highlighting again. We did have that tough comparables. The Instapak piece that got hit with that's what we didn't anticipate that the actually industrial market in the first quarter was tepid. So we think we'll recover that. As I mentioned, we are seeing the equipment installs in March alone up 40% year-over-year. That's a positive number for us.","And as you know Instapak, in our product the protective packaging business is our largest and most profitable line so that we feel good about that. The other piece I mentioned, our inflatable bubble on demand is going well. The automation was a gap that we hinted all last year even before we talked about APS coming into the portfolio. We've been working on the automation side, that's the part of the gap that we got hit in 2018 that we have to recover.","So we do have a strong pipeline out there. We got to go make it happen. But we're not given up on the year, on the volume on the protective packaging side.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Tyler Langton of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tyler Langton","Good morning. Thank you. Just had a question on the 70 million price cost benefit to EBITDA that you signed in Food Care I guess. I wonder if you can give some a little bit more details on what drove that I know so Ted you mentioned resins was a huge part of it, but I think in the release you also mentioned that South America saw a 25% revenue growth from U.S. dollar index pricing. Just trying to figure out if that played a role or just any more color there would be helpful?","Ted Doheny","So we definitely got some lift from resin, we talked about that. There's a lot of our Reinvent SEE activities that are focusing on rationalizing suppliers and getting better resin prices. We're actually going through accelerated resin qualification processes and substitution processes to basically have better resin prices and we're seeing that reflected through lower cost of goods sold, and ultimately higher margins as we go through. And we're always focusing our activities on our higher margin SKUs. We talked to you in the fourth quarter call in February about part of our Reinvent SEE being focused on SKU optimization, and we\u2019re leading customers towards those higher margin SKUs.","So I think, the combination of our critical evaluation of resin as well as our Reinvent SEE activities is giving that lift in price cost spread that you mentioned.","Lori Chaitman","And just as a reminder, we did say in the prepared remarks that the Reinvent SEE initiative $9 billion was realized in that price cost spread on that EBITDA Bridge and a few million dollars came from lower resin.","When we think actually, those productivity savings will continue as the year progresses, and obviously resin is always a bit of a moving target.","Operator next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Gabe Hajde of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions] ","Lori Chaitman","Operator, we want to move to the next question, or we can pull Gabe back in the queue when he comes back.","Operator","Thank you, one moment please. Our next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Your line is open. One moment, please. One moment, please. Gabe, your line is open.","Gabe Hajde","Yes, good morning. Can you hear me now?","Lori Chaitman","Yes, we can hear you now.","Gabe Hajde","Great. Hello, I was hoping to revisit the APS transaction a little bit, appreciate you on -- maybe those were all the details; but can you talk about maybe capital intensity of that business Ted?","And then, perhaps, what the growth profile look like and maybe another 3 years to 5 years leading up to 2018. Was trying to understand if 2018 was an aberration for some reason, if that's an organic number or if they in fact we're completing some acquisitions on their own? Thanks.","Ted Doheny","Yes. We looked closely at their growth and that's why are interested. And we also looked at their intellectual property. See what they were doing with their innovation, with the new products, that was a lot of focus for the business. Their growth rates were quite strong. So strong, single-digit to double-digit we mentioned in 2018. And that was organic.","And as far as their footprint, they're pretty concentrated in their markets that they have and also primarily in the U.S. So we think actually taking some of their products and their solutions to our footprint, we see some synergy opportunities there. As far as their capital intensity, with not sharing that yet, it's still a couple of months away, but we were interested in their profile of their business. They did -- 16% of their business is equipment and plus 70% is material and then the parts and service.","And that profile was quite interesting for us, of how strong of an equipment solution player there were and just to share relatively, that's double our size right now. So that's the part that we were quite interested in.","Then also those adjacent markets, it's always interesting when you study a competitor, you get to learn market share very quickly and you could see it clearly. And some of the markets that we haven't touched, in some of those food markets that they're in, are quite interesting.","And looking at some of those customer bases, that they have access to and some of their largest customers, actually connected to adjacent space for us, but we're not in. And one of those is in the food space.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chip Dillon of Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Chip Dillon","[Indiscernible]. Great. So, yes, I would like also to ask about the APS, trying to understand actually a little bit better the earnings profile. And I understand you can not disclose any specific information, but we're little bit puzzled by the wording that it's going to be EBITDA accretive, but obviously that's not that hard unless they have EBITDA losses. So what this kind of expectation for actual accretion to the bottom line after or even before any incremental interest costs and you also just mentioned in some of the slides, about their equipment sales, material sales.","You mentioned in the presentation -- the press release that you really like the company for the equipment but we still see that three quarters of their revenues come from materials. Is the breakdown on the income basis very different, than the sales profile and breakdown?","Bill Stiehl","Thanks for the question. I'll start with the financial piece of the question. And that is we've signed the deal with this point, we've not got to close the transaction, we anticipate that that's going to happen in July.","And then at that point, we'll provide more detail in terms of the impact on our full year guidance. We're clearly focusing on driving the profitable growth, we're looking at the operational synergies, but we've got to be very careful to kind of think through the financial accounting implications of the transaction, as well as the tax benefits that will achieve. We are going to have that be accretive to adjusted EBITDA in 2019 and we'll talk through the full impact on our guidance in late July.","And when Ted was talking about the APS equipment business, one thing that impressed Ted and me, as we looked at that business, was the exclusivity, arrangement that they had with the materials associated with the equipment. I think that they do that very, very well, and that's one of the things that seems very attractive to us, as we looked at the various pieces of their business, a significant one being equivalent.","Ted Doheny","And so if you look at the materials, we're talking about equipment a lot because we see that's an opportunity, especially where the markets are going, if this a food and this is a protected packaging.","If we look at our customers facilities, whether it's a large fulfillment center or meat packing plant, where the opportunity for automation is, how do you load the bag? How do you load the container? This is what they do very well, and it's a gap in our portfolio.","The materials piece, I just want to highlight that automation. That is the customer's words of how they get more efficient with their labor. Now the materials piece, which is over 70% of their business, is also an opportunity for us on synergies. We did analyze what their spend is, what their resin spend is, we know what our cost -- we think that's an uplift for us on the Synergy.","But we also saw across Synergy, that we're quite excited about, is their penetration with recycled materials. We found that their air questioning product is 97% recycle, that's really opened our eyes internally with our team on how we could really ramp-up our Bubble Wrap product lines with recycled content.","And then back to the question of the multiple that we're looking at, again, we're looking at something that we do want to pay more than our multiple. So that's what we're looking at. We'll give more detail that on close, but also the guard rails are there on the ROIC.","That's what we are excited about, that what we can do and what the go-forward multiple is and that translates to being North a double-digit ROIC opportunity for us. So, it matches our guard rails, strategic set, it's definitely going to fit to our operational leverage target. So lots of work, we studied this for quite some time. So we think this is going to be a nice addition to the Sealed Air portfolio.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neel Kumar of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Michael Slutsky","Hi, this is actually Michael Slutsky sitting in for Neel Kumar. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on some of the growth opportunities in e-commerce from the acquisition, given its increasing importance within products there.","Ted Doheny","Sure. If you look at e-commerce right now, it's again -- it's loading equipment quickly. So if you look at one of our largest e-commerce solutions is a mailer. The mailers today, what used to be in boxes, now comes in mailers. So in the e-commerce that's basically a billion boxes has been eliminated.","So how do you now go from a mailer and how do you load those in a high volume fashion? So instead of a person can load a mailer between 5 and 6 a minutes, how do you move that to 10, to 20, to 30? And that's where the Autobag comes in, so that Synergy there is how do you load back?","Now they're pouch, they are not cushion pouches. It doesn't have to be that way. So they actually are the market leader in loading bags from multiple different industries and again, highlighting food. So we see that Synergy and that's what e-commerce is looking for -- an automation system to load mailers, to load bags, to load pouches -- and they do quite well on the pouch. We see some nice synergies there.","Bill Stiehl","It also strengthens our sustainability portfolio quite nicely and the other thing that APS is done very, very well, is their innovation skill, is quite nice. I mean, we've heard Ted talk about our vitality index and how we need double that vitality index going forward. APS's innovation is supported by strong numbers of patents and we've been very impressed by not just what they've done so far, but what they've got in their future plans relative to innovation.","Ted Doheny","And I'll just highlight it again, we keep hitting this sustainability. Their product on their version of Bubble Wrap, their air pillows is 97% recycled content. That's a big deal.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Maguire of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good morning. Sort of a two-part question. One just on volumes in Food Care, specifically Europe. You noted some weakness there. I think you attributed it to Brexit. I don\u2019t think we've heard too many other companies\u2019 kind of call out Brexit specifically, especially in the food and beverage space, do you think that would play a major role?","So I just want to if you kind of expand those comments and related to that, are you seeing any negative impact already from sustainability concerns? Given that these are kind of plastic based products.","And then, the second related question was sort of on the acquisition. You had some challenges in Product Care over the last couple of quarters. Just wondering about the timing on this one. Do you think that integrating this might have too much complexity, given some of the restructuring and reinvention, Reinvent SEE, kind of activities taking place there? Thanks.","Bill Stiehl","So well, I am going to answer about the APS integration question first. And that was, we had the entire leadership team and their direct reports spend a lot of time due diligence process of this potential acquisition and part of the due diligence is not just understanding the business, but understanding what we need to do in order to integrate that business very, very quickly. So we do get that accretive lift to adjusted EBITDA that we've been discussing and we feel highly confident in our ability to quickly integrate this business and to highlight the strength that they actually bring to the table.","Ted Doheny","And then back to the Food Care on EMEA -- other people are not mentioning it. The impact for us on Brexit is basically the U.K., is the largest importer of beef from European countries. I was over there and actually met with the grocery store. So to your comment about is sustainability in plastics and issue there, absolutely. That's why we're talking about it everywhere, but as far as we think that's recovered issue and with the Brexit but for right now, it's part of our first quarter story. But full year, we think will be correction, it will hit our growth targets on Food Care.","Lori Chaitman","And just to add on what Ted said, actually in EMEA and North America, and really around the world, our sustainability -- our sustainable solutions in Food Care with case-ready is fueling the growth. So what we're seeing in EMEA, actually the U.K. is showing us; U.K. sales was up a little bit in the quarter, it's the other countries around it that were a little bit weaker and that's usually the Brexit concern.","So like Ted said, because U.K. is the biggest importer of feed from other European countries, there is just a little bit uncertainty around what's going to happen with that market and movement. But sustainability is fueling our growth in Europe and we do think that our recycled trays and some of the sale that we're making with recycled materials is going to continue to drive that growth throughout Europe and we're also seeing it now in North America.","I hope that helps clarify and add a little bit to what Ted said. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Rizzo of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Daniel Rizzo","Hi guys, just two questions. One; the follow-up on that. Would that suggest that the Brexit issue is going to cause some sort of weakness or stagnation until October because it hasn't been answered and there is still lot of uncertainty?","And number two; in terms of Product Care, is there opportunity for SKU rationalization there as you've talked about in Food Care?","Ted Doheny","So on the Brexit, I mean, it's really hard to say the total impact that we're going to see as we go into the fall. I mean, EMEA is 21% of our total Food care sales. So we still are very North America centric. We are very comfortable with our outlook relative to Food Care sales for the balance of the year, but we do see some countries in Europe. If you look at just stand alone Q1, Germany, Italy, France, Russia that are basically flat and it's a Brexit impact just because of the significance of what the U.K. actually imports. And on the SKU's, yes, we absolutely see an opportunity at that to rationalize the SKU's across Product Care as well as Food Care. The interesting data point on the Product Care is when you add after the closing of the transaction in July. If you add all the SKUs of the APS acquisition, you're going to actually see some very complementary products that get added, and will be able to absorb that portfolio quite well.","Lori Chaitman","And just to be specific, you asked about Brexit over the rest of the year. We actually are expecting volumes rebound going forward, we think that the concern on Brexit is enough to do it. Some taxes and some tariffs and probably you could -- we probably need to ask our value a little bit more in detail, but with that question it wasn\u2019t anything that was that drastic from these other countries, but when we looked at Germany, Italy, France and U.K. those are our four largest countries in Europe.","Like I said, Europe was up a little bit, but Germany, Italy and France, which is softer -- which is softer than what we had anticipated and it did have to deal with that -- just that slowdown due to Brexit, but again, going forward, it could be more clarity in that market and we do you expect it to recover over the next three quarters. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde of Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Ted. Question for you, a company that made kind of paper dunnage and paper dunnage systems got taken out. A few months ago, it got a really high valuation that had high margins and high growth. But when I look at this, some of it is pretty similar to technologies that Sealed Air has had for years. So I just -- I wonder if there's any lessons from that competitor versus what Sealed Air has done and things you might be able to do different going forward in that business.","And then just secondly, if we could get some thought on this African swine flu issue and what impact that might have on your business going forward.","Ted Doheny","Sure. Let me do the African swine flu first just because it was tied into the previous questions on Food Care. We did see a small impact in the first quarter, basically a couple of million dollars in sales and actually got to see it. Personally, I was over in Russia so I'd see the effect -- global effect.","But what it\u2019s actually doing and it's driving the exports into China. So we're seeing that activity. So we think it's actually shouldn't overall be affecting us. But we are definitely seeing the impact of it into China and again, it's another great advantage we have of our global footprint and being connected to our global customers that when there is an issue in one area, we will see the corrections sometimes not in the quarter but we'll see it in the year.","Good question, Mark. As you asked about looking and partly just share with you, even on APS is how that looks. We've looked at over 30 different companies in the past year and we looked at paper companies that we've elected not to go after and the -- where we looked is what can we do, what do they have. It could add value to us that we couldn\u2019t do on our own. So, we're putting M&A side-by-side with our innovation team.","And as we've talked about doubling our innovation, so our paper system's actually is up double digit. That's in our product and protective packaging business is quite strong. It's double-digit on a small number So, we're looking to see what more we can do, definitely looking at paper and what's going in the packaging, looking at phone, looking at plastics, looking at recycle, We want to make sure we have that in our portfolio, anticipate where the market is going.","Also, we're looking at which tied into, looking at other companies in this space, is their go-to-market strategy. So very important on going through direct, through distribution or e-commerce, so it's another piece of Reinvent SEE as we look to further grow our Protective Packaging as we look at in the M&A space now with APS. But even in our own portfolio, what can we do is the channels to go after those markets beyond actually the innovation piece.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","I'm showing no questions at the time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ted for any closing remarks.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you.","Ted Doheny","Great. I wasn't expecting that quick. Okay, great. I want to thank everyone for the call today. I think it's important to keep in mind that Reinvent SEE is about driving profitable growth. We are simplifying our organization, so we can move faster in the markets we serve and through our accelerated innovation, we're increasing our speed to market ensuring that we deliver the best products at the right price and making them sustainable. Our capital investments are focused on improving our productivity engine and we are excited to bring Automated Packaging Systems into the Sealed Air family. So thank you. And with that, turning to Lori, we'll close the call.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you. Operator?","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect."],"19134":["Sealed Air Corporation (NYSE:SEE) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call August  2, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Lori Chaitman - VP, IR","Ted Doheny - President & CEO","Jim Sullivan - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Ghansham Panjabi - Baird","Mark Wilde - Bank of Montreal","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs","Gabe Hajde - Wells Fargo","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets","Tyler Langton - JPMorgan","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Sealed Air Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] ","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Miss Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you and good morning everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future periods are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release and slide presentation, which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You will find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in our earnings release. Included in the appendix of today's presentation, you will find U.S. GAAP financial results that correspond to some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures we reference throughout the presentation.","Before we begin, I would like to note that this morning as you may have seen, we filed our second quarter Form 10-Q which included some updated language around legal proceedings and risk factors related to the ongoing investigations by the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice. As I'm sure you can appreciate, we are not able to comment beyond what's disclosed in the Form 10-Q and we'll not take questions regarding these matters. We take financial reporting controls and compliance very seriously and are fully cooperating with the regulatory authorities. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted Doheny, our President and CEO. Ted?","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Lori. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter\u2019s earnings conference call. On today's call, I'm going to start with a recap of our second quarter results and the continued success of our Reinvent SEE strategy. I'll discuss the exciting acquisition of Automated Packaging Systems, or APS, which we closed yesterday, and how this will be a key platform for us to accelerate our growth. Then I'll provide an update on our sustainability. Jim will expand on our financial results for the quarter and provide an update on our outlook for 2019. We will then open the call for your questions. ","Now turn to our second quarter results on slide three. We had solid performance in the quarter in first half of the year, demonstrating strong execution on our Reinvent SEE transformation. In constant dollars, we delivered","12% adjusted EBITDA growth on 4% higher sales compared to last year. Our top line performance was largely attributable to higher volumes in North America and South America contribution from our recent acquisitions. ","Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 160 basis points to 20.4%. We also delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.80, a 25% increase over last year, we remain focused on profitable growth and our results in the quarter reflect the high level of commitment and achievement by our entire global team at Sealed Air. ","As I mentioned, we completed the APS acquisition, which was valued at $510 million on a cash and debt free basis. Keep in mind, cash paid at closing was closer to $450 million, as about $60 million of the purchase price includes the assumption of legacy deferred compensation plan for certain APS employees, which will be paid out over the next three years, after considering synergies and tax benefits, the acquisition has an estimated enterprise value to 2018 adjusted EBITDA multiple of eight times. Both Jim and I will provide more detail on APS in our discussion today.","Our business continues to face some macro headwind and a global choppy environment. These headwinds, -- despite these headwinds our one Sealed Air culture is driving share gains with new products, we're focusing on incremental growth opportunities by market by product and by geography. The progress we're making with Reinvent SEE, coupled with our efforts to overcome macro headwinds, is enabling us to raise our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance and strengthen our future earnings power.","Turning to slide four, our journey to reinvent the company is gaining traction and impacting our results. Acting is one Sealed Air is enabling us to move more rapidly around the world and grow faster than the markets we serve. With our Sealed Air operational excellence, we're reinventing the entire process from how we innovate, to how we sell. We're accelerating our speed to market on new innovations, through our own resources, and through acquisitions. ","We're developing highly differentiated innovations, with the goal of producing the best products at the right price, and making them sustainable. Our global go-to-market strategies involving to a more centralized and targeted approach to drive product cost efficiency we're optimizing our network with selective asset upgrades, and more automation. There's still significant opportunities be delivered with our Reinvent SEE transformation is more than half of the total projected benefits are there in progress are still being planned. ","Overall, we're very confident our global initiatives will deliver annualized benefits of greater than $250 million by the end of 2021, which will drive our 40% plus operating leverage target.","Let's now turn to slide five, and review our acquisition of Automated Packaging Systems in more detail. Known for its iconic Autobag brand, APS is a market leader that provides us with unique and innovative solutions, complete with automated equipment, advanced materials, best-in-class engineering, and field service.","APS aligns with Reinvent SEE and our goal of doubling the rate of our innovation. APS is highly complementary to our protective packaging solutions for e-commerce and fulfillment operation and offers us adjacent opportunities in the food packaging sector including eat foods, produce, snack foods and portion controlled meals. ","In 2018, APS generated $290 million in sales and $40 million in adjusted EBITDA. The value creation of this acquisition is very compelling. We believe there are meaningful opportunities to leverage our global reach and customer breath with their unique automation solutions. We expect to generate annual run rate productivity synergies of approximately $15 million by the end of 2021.","These synergies will come from a larger combined company. We'll apply the same Reinvent SEE work streams to APS. This transaction includes expected text benefits with a net present value of approximately $70 million.","Before I passed the call to Jim, I'd like to spend a few minutes on a topic that's top of mind with our people and our customers, sustainability highlighted on Slide 6. We believe that our sustainable offerings differentiate Sealed Air there and the markets we serve today will be a key differentiator going forward. At Sealed Air, we produce materials that are designed to protect and preserve, whether its food safety, food ways, or product protection, our solutions minimize waste and prevent damage.","There's still a tremendous amount of work to be done around the world to create a circular economy. Given what we do and who we are in packaging, we have the responsibility to lead the way in our industry and achieve our mission to leave our world better than we found it.","We're addressing sustainability head on with our innovations. We're working with several suppliers, partners and peers on the most environmentally efficient way to manufacture, recover and recycle essential packaging materials. I want to share a few examples of how we're leading the industry towards a circular economy.","We're advancing the use of our Food Care scrap is raw materials for product care. For example, production of a new Bubble Wrap formulation that runs on existing commercial equipment contain greater than 90% postindustrial recycled material. This is enabling us to create green Bubble Wrap in 2020.","We've commercialized post-consumer recycled application and offer solutions that contain recycled materials. Such solutions include our Darfresh or vacuum skin packaging, modified atmospheric packaging, and conventional overlap. These solutions are meeting increased customer demand, particularly in Europe for more sustainable packaging.","We're investing in multiple plant-based materials as well as manufacturing they've added manufacturing capacity through a partnership with [indiscernible] it is on track for production in 2020.","Our scientists have demonstrated that many of our multiple layer material can be converted to petrochemical feedstocks for synthesis in new plastics. Discussions are underway with key suppliers to partner on accelerating commercial development of chemical recycling technology. It's also important to highlight that we're expanding our engagement with the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. I had the opportunity to see firsthand the plastics waste challenge as part of a research expedition off the Coast of Bermuda in June.","I physically pick trash out of the ocean that's being dumped and mismanaged by multiple sources. In July, we had our first Alliance board meeting, and together with 20 CEO members, we approved 12 new projects to combat sources of ocean waste, as well as a communication strategy to promote the work that's now underway.","We have a lot of work to do, but we will lead in fixing this problem.","I'll now pass the call to Jim to review our results in more detail. Jim?","Jim Sullivan","Thank you, Ted. On Slide 7, we'll start with the review of our net sales by region. In the second quarter sales increased 1% as reported, and 4% in constant dollars. North America, our largest region representing 59% of the company's sales grew 4% year-over-year in constant dollars. ","South America, our smallest region where we have U.S. Dollar Index pricing was up 30%. Asia Pacific was up 1% due to the contribution from our Austin Foam acquisition, while sales and then EMEA were essentially unchanged.","Slide 8 highlights our regional performance in the first half of the year. Our first half performance and constant dollars is very similar to the second quarter. One thing to note is that going forward with automated packaging systems integrated into our financials, North America will count roughly 65% of our net sales.","Turning to Slide 9. Here we highlight our volume and price trends by business segment and by region. In the second quarter, overall volumes turned modestly positive despite continuing macro headwinds across our business. ","Improving volume trends in North and South America were partially upset by volume declines in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Favorable price of 1% was driven by the U.S. dollar index pricing at South America. Price in North America was slightly unfavorable due to timing or formula path through in Food Care.","On slide 10, we present our year-over-year sales in adjusted EBITDA bridges for the second quarter. Excluding currency translation and acquisitions. Organic sales were up $17 million, or 1.5% year-over-year. ","Adjusted EBITDA of $237 million an increased $19 million or 9%, with margins up 160 basis points to 20.4%. This earnings increase was largely attributable to our Reinvent SEE initiatives. In price cost spread, we benefited from Reinvent actions around direct materials, rate optimization and value capture. We also benefited from lower input costs.","Higher operating costs were largely due to labor inflation, increased non-material manufacturing costs, and some incremental spending to support future growth, which was partially offset by Reinvent SEE productivity enhancements.","These productivity enhancements include network optimization, manufacturing process changes that are improving yields, and utilization rates and ongoing efficiencies, resulting from our one Sealed Air operating model.","We also realize $17 million in savings from restructuring actions. Acquisitions contributed $30 million of sales in the quarter with $29 million related to Austin Foam. Adjusted EBITDA from acquisitions was only $1 million. Austin Foam's top and bottom-line performance has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the global industrial production and the trade dispute with China.","We are moving quickly to integrate Austin Foam into our broader fabrication solutions business and shifting manufacturing to lower costs regions to drive improve profitability. Currency in the quarter was $7 million unfavorable to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EPS in the second quarter was $0.80 on average diluted shares outstanding of $155 million. ","This compares to $0.64 in second quarter of 2018 roughly $0.11 of the $0.16 year-over-year adjusted EPS improvement was higher pre-tax income, with the remaining $0.05 approximately evenly split between a lower tax rate and a lower share count from the share repurchase program.","The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 19.4% compared to 22.6% in the second quarter 2018. This year-over-year improvement was primarily due to a release of evaluation allowance in South America that was triggered in the quarter by improved profitability in the region from Reinvent SEE initiatives.","On slide 11, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the first half of the year. As illustrated on this slide. Year-to-date, we have realized approximately $75 million of Reinvent SEE benefits, with $29 million coming from restructuring actions. In the back half of the year, we expect another roughly $60 million of Reinvent SEE benefits, of which about $40 million will come from restructuring savings.","However, keep in mind our formula pricing and Food Care is expected to be more aligned with raw material cost. So, we are assuming left contribution from price cost spread in the third and fourth quarters.","Turning to our results by segment on slide 12, we present second quarter results for Food Care. Food Care net sales of $711 million were up 4% in constant dollars, primarily driven by higher volumes of 2.4% and favorable price of 1.3%. ","Adjusted EBITDA increased 15%, to $156 million and margins improved 290 basis points to 21.9% of sales. North American South America Food Care volumes were up 4% and 7%, respectively, strength in North America was due to strong exports, increased consumer demand for fresh packed proteins and continued adoption of our case ready and fluids platforms.","South America performance was driven by 15% volume growth in Brazil where we benefited from higher equipment sales, a stronger export market and share gains. In EMEA our volume was up 1% despite a softening economic environment, and lower protein production. ","We experienced increased demand for our sustainable solutions that contain recycled materials and offer postconsumer recyclability. Volumes in Asia Pacific were down 2%, this is the only region in our food care segment with a decline in volume trends and was primarily related to timing of equipment sales in Australia.","We continue to expect food care to outperform global protein markets. Global protein production is expected to be up slightly in 2019, which compares to our food care constant dollars sales growth outlook of 4%. ","As previously mentioned, increase consumer demand for fresh proteins is driving adoption of our case ready platform across all proteins and we expect the export markets to remain strong in both North America and South America, largely driven by the protein shortage in China.","On Slide 13 we highlight results from a product care segment. In the second quarter products care net sales of 450 million were up 4% in constant dollars. Excluding the Austin phone acquisition products care net sales were down 2% driven by volume declined of 3% partially offset by favorable price of less than 1%. The volume declined in the quarter was driven by industrial weakness in Europe and Asia, and lower sales of traditional bubble wrap, mailers and void [ph] though.","Adjusted EBITDA of $84 million or 18.7% of sales was up 7% and margins expanded 90 basis points. Restructuring savings favorable price cost spread and other benefits from reinvents see were partially offset by lower volumes and higher operating costs, including labor and indirect material inflation. In product share we are evolving our go to market strategy to better align with changing and market dynamics. ","We expect continued growth in our value-added solutions portfolio, which currently represents about 20% of the segment and includes inflatable bubble wrap, automation, paper systems and temperature assurance.","In the second quarter this part of the business was up approximately 10% and going forward we will include the APS business. We continue to target pocket of strength in the industrial market were our B2B customers are looking to modify their packaging and ensure their products are personal ready versus power read. ","Industrial application account for approximately 40% of our product care sales, it is worth noting that our industrial applications in North America were flat year-over-year in the quarter. This compares to a decline of roughly 5% in the first quarter. And we saw this specifically in our instant back business following strong equipment installations in March.","For the remainder of the year, we expect product care organic volumes to be challenged by the decelerating global industrial market and the ongoing trade dispute with China. With that said we're excited to bring APS into seal [ph] there and believe they're complementary and differentiated portfolio will add significant value to our customers seeking sustainable solutions that provide automation and labor savings.","As Ted, mentioned APS has a strong record of line growth, but the results today in 2019 reflects some of the macro challenges facing seal there, as of the last 12 months ending June 30, APS sales were proximally $292 million in adjusted EBITDA was approximately $41 million. So modest gains so far this year versus 2018 results. However, we remain encouraged by the go forward opportunities to leverage the dedicated people technologies and capabilities across both the organizations to better serve our customers and drive significant efficiencies overtime. ","Let\u2019s turn to our year-to-date free cash flow on slide 14. In the first half of the year we generated $75 million of free cash flow compared to the use of $37 million in the same period in 2018. A $112 million year-over-year improvement was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower cash tax payments. Partially offset by increased CapEx spending and 0:00:42.3 program of investments.","Additionally, one-time cash outflows related to diverse fee and the buyout of royalty license agreement with an outside engineering firm impacted 2018. During the second quarter the company also invested $23 million in two small acquisitions in the food care segment.","One of the acquisitions had a geographic footprint in the Philippines and the other added unique digital printing technologies and capabilities. Net debt at the end of the second quarter totaled $3.4 billion net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA was 3.7 times. On a proforma basis including the APS acquisition net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA was 4X which is at the high end of our targeted net leverage range.","We do expect net leverage by year end 2019 to drop to approximately 3.8 times with our cash generation and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA in the back half of the year. Now turning to our updated 2019 outlook on slide 15. We now anticipate net sales to be approximately $4.85 billion or about 2% growth for the year as reported. ","On a constant dollar basis net sale are expected to increase approximately 5%. Food care is on track to deliver 4% constant dollar growth of which about $10 million will come from the previously mentioned small second quarter acquisitions.","Product care is now expected to deliver 7% constant dollar growth which includes a $180 million from acquisitions. APS is expected to contribute approximately a $120 million over the next five months and the remaining $60 million is from loss in firm. ","For product care organic sales growth, we have revised our forecast to be down approximately 3% compared to our previous expectation of up 1.5%. this revision is largely due to the slowdown we\u2019ve been experiencing in the industrial sector particularly in North America and China.","Adjusted EBITDA for the full year is now expected to be approximately $950 million to $960 million that\u2019s compared to our previous guidance of $925 million to $945 million. our revised outlook includes $10 million to $12 million from APS but keep in mind, that $10 million to $12 million includes a one-time inventory purchase accounting charge which we are currently estimating in that $6 million. adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. this compares to our previous provided range of $2.65 to $2.75.","Our guidance assumes approximately $0.07 of dilution from APS which includes $0.09 of non-cash purchase accounting and tangible amortization and the one-time inventory step up charge. The outlook for adjusted EPS is based on our roughly a $155 million shares outstanding and does not assume share repurchases for the remainder of the year. for the full year 2019 we continued to anticipate an approximate 26% adjusted tax rate.","We are reducing our core cash for free cash flow to a $180 million from $250 million to reflect the $59 million noble tax settlement and the first installment payment of $20 million for the closed APS deferred incentive compensation plan. Our revised CapEx for the full year is $210 million which includes $10 million for APS. ","We are now forecasting cash tax payments to be approximately a $115 million which compares to our previous forecasts of $130 million. The $15 million reduction is primarily result of estimated tax benefits from the Novipax settlement and the APS acquisition, partially offset by text payments on higher earnings.","We expect to continue to spend $115 million on Reinvent SEE associated payments in 2019. For the full year, net interest payments are expected to be $190 million. To fund the APS acquisition, we secured a new 3-year term loan A tranche to our existing credit facility. Strong lender demand for funded assets helped us lower the credit spread for this loan by 37.5 basis points versus the pricing of the existing loans in the facility.","Additional interest expense for 5 months from this term loan add on a $7 million are expected to be offset by savings from increased cash flows in the first half of the year and a lower than previously anticipated interest rate environment.","Let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks and then we'll open up for question and answer. Ted?","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Jim. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress throughout the year. Reinvent SEE is about accelerating profitable growth and increasing earnings power. It's illustrated on this slide; you can see how we're reinventing our powerful brands and acting as one company. We're communicating or 4 pieces of Reinvent SEE performance, people, products, processes and sustainability and how they're increasing efficiency, unleashing growth and creating value for our shareholders. We're excited for what's ahead and will continue to focus on what's in our control to drive our success.","With that, I'll now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed.","Ghansham Panjabi","Thank you and Jim, welcome to the call.","Jim Sullivan","Thank you.","Ghansham Panjabi","Yes. Thank you. Looking back at the second quarter on relativity initial plan. I guess first off what surprised you to the upside in context of a more benign raw material backdrop, maybe the cadence of cost savings mixes et cetera. Just some more color in terms of what drove this upside specific 2Q. And then related to that Food Care volumes grew by nicely in the second quarter relative of the first quarter. How should we think about segment volumes for the back half of this year and if you can break that down by sub region that would be helpful? I know Jim give some comments on core sales, but wanted to focus specifically on volumes? Thanks so much.","Ted Doheny","Okay. I'll give a high level and let Jim give you some of the bridge to go the detail. I don't want to say what surprises, but our confidence in the quarter, if we look at from how the business performed. We're definitely as we highlight in our prepared remarks that our Reinvent SEE savings are coming through.","We have a high level of confidence our initiatives that we have in place, the cost actions we're going after, as well as the growth opportunities. We have good line of sight clarity; we saw that hit the bottom-line. The other part on the markets. They -- we definitely know the markets have been choppy. We obviously looking at the competitors what's going on there.","With surprises actually on the upside is in the industrial space, we're seeing where some of our new products hit, that is good. But we still have the challenge in the headwinds. So, a quick summary is the best benefit in the quarter was our Reinvent savings. I'll let Jim go through some of the details that you asked on the bridges.","Jim Sullivan","Well, I think looking at the original guidance, we clearly had contemplated more volume growth on product care where we didn't see it. Fortunately, we did have this Reinvent SEE engine going hard. For the full year, I think when the company came into the year that we're expecting about $70 million of savings. And you'll note from the slide that we delivered $75 million. So, we were more than able to offset that volume decline, primarily in product care from the Reinvent savings.","As we sit here. Today, as you know, we're looking at $135 million for the full year from Reinvent another 60 and total in the back half of the year with 40 of that being restructuring. So that's really the story is the reinvent is delivering outstanding results. In terms of the kind of profile first half, second half, I mean, we are expecting in the back half of the year on a consolidated basis, let's call it roughly 1.5% organic, 4% organic would be kind of where we're at with Food Care, so really no surprise there. In Product Care, we would be same more like a negative three organic in the back half of the year. But again, over delivering on the reinvest benefits.","Ted Doheny","Just one other thing on -- looking at the Food Care, if we look at our business, and as we share with you and others that we're really trying to act as one company, so you'll see us talking more as one company but specifically on Food Care, you'll see that 4% that we see in the growth in the second -- in the first half, we're seeing -- we're planning on that, and we're driving that to continue through the second half of the year. So that that is good news in that business and despite all the issues that we're facing, that's very important to driving our profitability for the business.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","And our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Mark [ph] sitting in for George. I just want to ask kind of a high-level question on Product Care. So, with Amazon's, shipping and container initiatives, and other moves we're seeing to optimize box size and e-commerce is that initially negative for Product Care? And if so, how long before you can get some more benefit from very machinery from your automated packaging lines? Thank you.","Ted Doheny","Hi, Molly. And I hope George is doing better. If we look at the Product Care as you highlighted that that work is in process. So, with what's happening and e-commerce and that shift in our business and our portfolio, we are seeing the traditional business, we are still doing well with our Bubble Wrap on demand, or core view solutions, et cetera. ","But as they go to package zones container, they're looking for less stuff in the package, and also driving automation. So, the issue is, can we drive an automated solution that's actually loading the package automatically. So that transition will take over time, it will take time. But what's -- what we're excited, when APS comes in with their auto bag even that's their iconic brand. ","That's exactly what it does, rather than a person loading one bag at a time, they have their side pouch system that loads multiple units and increases what one person can do six per minute and loading a package to 12 to even higher levels.","So, we're seeing that change happen over time, what it means to our portfolio, we have some internal product development, working in that space. We have some sustainable solutions that we think are quite interesting. And we also have some lower carbon footprint solutions, because that's where the mailers come in as well, by taking the box out of the process.","So, the transitions in place, it is showing up our business and what we've lost in the Product Care business. But we feel pretty confident that over time, and hopefully sooner rather than later, we'll get some of that business back and more.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Ted, Jim, Lori.","Ted Doheny","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","I wondered, Ted if you can give us a little more color on APS. And I, I guess I'm particularly focused on sort of the margin profile in that business because it looks like it's on an LTM basis. It's about a 14% EBITDA margin. So, it's lower than the existing margins that you have in Product Care? I'm also kind of curious about what the margin progression has been over the last four or five years and how stable is margins tend to be across the cycle?","Ted Doheny","Okay, good question. And we try to put the slide out there, Mark to kind of help business we actually refer to the slide is trying to lay that out. Well, first of all, what we're interested in this business and we've been signaling incense I've been with the company as well how important automation is and to look at their percent of equipment, service parts and materials. ","So, first of all, if you look at their equipment, they're 16% equipment and 70% materials. If you look at what we call the solutions multiplier, and they actually use that language, their materials are 9X to each piece of equipment. ","Also, with their equipment and by the way I\u2019m describing this to get to that 15% profitability that\u2019s higher much higher level of equipment percentage but there have dedicated material to their equipment and their service and there embedded in with the customer and their roughly 60% of direct business. ","So yes, the overall profitability is lower than where we are with our business, but what they do for that full system with a high level of equipment that's quite interesting for us. We been looking at and for well over year and actually we need I probably need to give a shout to the APS employees listening welcome to seal there.","We had a first day of operations there yesterday, my management team was there. I was there via; I will be there personally, but I want to make sure I say hello to the team. So now see actually day 1 behind the curtain of how they do what they do from analyzing from the outside. ","So, I think that\u2019s where we're excited about the opportunities, what they were doing with the equipment then also on their profitability looking at their materials so that something that we know very, very well. And so, looking at those materials looking at what they have under sustainability side. We saw a very high sustainability content on their pillows or if you look at other piece of equipment, they have a patented easy care very interesting in innovation on the air pillows.","So, looking at the business we see products we like but the customer overlap is less than 10% that\u2019s very exciting for us as we look at our complementary products. Then the third pieces there is their presence in food, which is roughly about 15%. So, in the profitability side, we see opportunities to move that 15% north of 20% on this piece they have, we actually see opportunities that they need people help our larger organizations to be more profitable and successful in the market as well.","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed","Brian Maguire","Good morning everyone and welcome Jim. Just question on the volume and food care is nice to see the growth rate bounce back in 2Q, I think last call you talked about 1Q seeing some negative impact from Brexit and just wanted if you experience maybe some restocking benefit in the quarter, if you could comment on any impact from that and outlook for the second half of the year seems pretty positive on food care, does look like we're increasingly drifting towards a new deal Brexit, just wondering if you think that we could see sort of repeat of the 1Q weaknesses in the eventuality that we did have something like that. ","And then just wondering also your comments on the protein deficit in China, you are baking in the expectation benefits from that in your guidance and how if anything tariffs could factor into the ability specifically from the U.S to kind of export into China. Thanks.","Ted Doheny","Okay. I hope I get all those questions back; Jim help me out I will pick a couple and if you want to jump in couple of those wells. First of all, looking at when we give you information about what's going on the market and I will just share even how we manage internally, we do what to use some of those things like Brexit is an excuse. ","Because we have to overcome that, and we have to deal with that. So, there are issues what we're seeing with even the trade issues around the world. So, looking at Europe in general we are that's an issue that where we have a heavy focus on what we can do and get that grow. What we're seeing the change is on the sustainability side.","This war on plastics is really, really everywhere and that\u2019s why even I moved it upfront is our first slide in the presentation, especially strong in Europe. So, with our food care business it's where Brexit means is where the process UK, back and forth into Europe but the food will get the right place, it\u2019s in the right package at the right price and making it sustainable. ","So, we seem some actual gains, we need more at our sustainable care packaging that were using more recycled content. So, we have seen gains in that. Different from quarter to quarter, we have seen in the North America, I\u2019m still strong and actually South America you saw very strong. I was actually was in Brazil twice in the last month meeting with our top customers actually our largest customers actually headquartered in Brazil and so there you think the shift and what\u2019s going on with this economic activity. ","And the other thing that\u2019s being highlighted is the African swine fever, how are those protein markets going to shift enable to get the fresh meat into China. So, we actually see the North America, fairly strong, South America very strong, the good news is we have a very strong presence there.","So, I\u2019ll take a pause Jim I might have missed a couple of these other questions we have if you want to add some color.","Jim Sullivan","Yeah, I guess in terms of food care as I look at the business over the last month, the first half of the year we had organic growth let\u2019s call it just above 3.5%. but a fair amount of that was coming from pricing, as we look at the back half of the year let\u2019s call it the midpoint of our new guide we\u2019ve been looking for a similar level of organic growth in total with more on volume as these formula pricing pass through has kick in in the back half of the year with food.","In terms of the overall effect of the protein deficiency in China that was there, we look at that over the last few weeks and right now it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re being heard and there\u2019s probably a little bit of an argument that maybe we\u2019re being benefited because of the strong exports that we\u2019re seeing out in North America and Brazil. But clearly with new tariffs that might come through as we go back and forth between China it\u2019s to the extent something, we\u2019re to affect that. We have ability to supply another world there as but that could be somewhat of a risk.","Ted Doheny","And coming that fair Jim being the one-month expert here on that good job. The other piece that we\u2019re hearing the bottom line is that we have to quantify and that\u2019s where Jim\u2019s done a great job already so what\u2019s the problem where we need to go fix? We\u2019ve assessed internally the African swine fever even though we think it will be a benefit I ask directly our customers they believe it will be a benefit to us because we\u2019re positioned where the proteins will shift.","And even proteins that are going to be part of our future like - the number we put on it is roughly $3 million that we\u2019re going to have to go make up and the reason for that is some of that short term is going to be shipping frozen carcasses into China we don\u2019t get the same concentration as when it goes fresh. Our connection is to fresh. We\u2019re seeing the pickup bill in Australia so all the equipment pickup in Australia so we\u2019re feeling that but overall what we\u2019ve got an issue we\u2019re going after $3 million that\u2019s going to hit and that we\u2019re going to go cover that.","Lori Chaitman","Operator next?","Operator","Okay our next question is from Adam [ph] with KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey Jim and Lori, good morning and thanks for taking my questions I appreciate it. Just two part around APS, Ted you mentioned it stood about $0.07 if you add back the inventory step up its call neutral so I guess what about that in your mind should be kind of exciting to shareholders that you\u2019re doing a neutral the 090 by the end of \u201921 you\u2019re guiding to annualize synergies of 15 but I would say that\u2019s a fair way to have from here.","And just also on the APS the $60 million of the 510 purchase price that\u2019s going to APS as European employees on that shares, just an accounting question why is that not why is that furniture operating cash flow is supposed to being classified as part of the purchase price and that\u2019s going to cash from investing?","Ted Doheny","I\u2019ll let Jim go to the accounting piece and then I\u2019ll share with you again why we think it\u2019s good for investors.","Jim Sullivan","Okay sure so on the $60 million deferred in kind of compensation obviously it\u2019s not great that we have $60 million post-closing running through our cash from operations and this is really a legacy and however we looked at the accounting closely and the reason for is going through operations is that the payments coming out of that plan are going to the current employees and so the accounting rules are pretty straight forward there.","If you have money going to that\u2019s benefiting if you will the current employee base those through operations so we\u2019ll have to just remind everyone in next few years we\u2019re going to have about $20 million a year that\u2019s really related to the purchase price it\u2019s just unfortunately we\u2019re not going to be able to overcome that from an accounting perspective.","Ted Doheny","Okay good and then Adam to your point shareholders and the value here I don\u2019t want to say trust has betrayed some of the reinvent fee very challenging, but we see that opportunity just like Reinvent SEE, and by the way, we're going to be applying day one, our Reinvent SEE work streamed to APS, but really the whole focus on what they do and what we do, looking what they do and equipment. ","And equipment is an accelerator, that solutions multiplier that I shared with where they are for every dollar for equipment sales, they get 9x the materials, that is extremely compelling, if we can bring that to our business, very, very compelling. Their way they're entrenched with their customers, because of the equipment, the stickiness there is very, very impressive on what they do, and take care of those markets and how they serve. ","And that's why they're leading automation, because that's what our customers are asking. Our customers and having a very difficult time with getting the right people in the right place and driving automation. They are leader in that so we're quiet, we're quite excited, what that's going to give us is a market growth opportunity.","The performance, we're very comfortable, we can work together and prove that important performance is part of our Reinvent SEE and get them to our profitability. The numbers we gave you out there to reflect they seem to slow down in the market that we've had, in the year-over-year, we're being very clear and very transparent. But the previous years that we've looked at the last three years, in the same space where a product carrier, primarily they do have 20% food, they've been growing at a significantly higher rate than we are.","So, we're excited that they have the market cap -- the market potential to complimentary elements of what they do. We're excited that we can make this very good.","Jim Sullivan","Okay, one other accounting related question. So, we did say $0.07 dilution. That's based on our best estimate, right now purchase accounting, and as everybody knows, we're going to have to go through a full fair value analysis and that could change a little bit as we finish out the year. ","But keep in mind I want to remind you that that $0.07 does include the inventory step up and the charge. And that's about what $0.025 to $0.03 of that $0.07 and then an edition a couple other thing I would say is that if you just look at it on a cash basis, it's a creative right away. ","So, if you exclude the noncash purchase accounting, it's accretive right away. And then next year, even with a pretty heavy chunk of purchase accounting amortization flowing through, we look at that business being roughly neutron and adjusted EPS basis.","Ted Doheny","And internally, they -- internal number for year one is higher than to make it agree. Okay.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Gabe Hajde","Good morning. I have a question around some of this alternative protein sources that we're hearing about. And I was curious if you've done some work? Presumably the answer is yes. But talk about some of the barrier properties that might be required for the food packaging around. I don't know, plant-based protein burgers and stuff like that. And whether or not you see it as a long-term opportunity for that business.","Ted Doheny","Yeah, it's actually quite interesting for where the world is going with fresh meat. We are seeing -- but first answer your question, we are connected, we are doing the packaging that business and they do need the same thing to keep it fresh and protected. And they need the barrier protection with what we do with our Cryovac material does apply to that and so we are connected.","We're also seeing an interest in staying close to our customers in the QSR world, we're finding that it's actually helping the meat business. Looking at the QSR is where they go into restaurants. And now they have an alternative give me a protein that's from vegetables or the vegans, the whole family is going out to eat. ","So right now, we're actually seeing the projecting -- from our customers are projecting. This will help drive the protein market where we're very strong in. So first the answer the question yes, we're connected to this with packaging, they need the Cryovac technology which is exciting for us. And two, right now it looks like it's actually going help the protean market growth.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys this is [indiscernible] filing in for Chip and Jim welcome. First little bit goes back to e-commerce Amazon, I know you said overall, I know you said overall your working also this acquisition to address some of these issues but just little bit in the short-term the next few quarters couple of years. How are you seeing demand for traditional e-commerce product you're selling like your mailers the board feel, in terms of the unit volumes and how should that translate to what growth rate could that translates for your product segment for 2019 and 2020.","Ted Doheny","Well right now we're working aggressively on new designs, new products just on the mailers itself, again sustainable design as I shared that part of the green bubble wrap of 2020 that\u2019s also connected to our mailers. On the automated solution side that\u2019s something we're going to look very quickly at APS to see do they have an automated solution that can help accelerate the gap in our portfolio that we lost out to that segment.","So, we think we have some upside opportunity there. We also need to get more efficient driving into our operations and what we're doing in that part of the business, we think we have some operational efficiency that we can do more efficient in a more competitive method. We think it\u2019s some upside opportunity the year-over-year that part of the tough fix that we got to fix in the food care or the product care business.","Lori Chaitman","Operator next question please.","Operator","Next question from Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Neel Kumar","Thanks just question on product care, so you talked about your value-added solutions been of about 10% in the quarter and I was wondering if you think this level growth the sustainable and how large this can get a whole percentage of your portfolio from 20% currently.","Ted Doheny","Probably not able to give you exact percentage on that but that\u2019s where our focus is. The value added word we're using to really to drive us also just not just talking about the price, you get the product, you get the prize we're really focusing with their customers, what can we eliminate in our products, as what can we eliminate in our package and even what new material to drive that. so, this is a part of our growth. We talked to this one well. So, I think the continuation of the growth, what percentage of our portfolio don't have a direct answer for that, but this is our focus and this will grow.","Lori Chaitman","Operator I think we have time for two more question.","Operator","No problem. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Arun Viswanathan","Thanks for taking my question good morning. I just had a question about growth rate that you're achieving, so if you think about the legacy guidance in 935 range. It looks like you previously guided to about 4% to 6% EBITDA growth. I guess is that kind of would be in your range of long-term expectations. ","So, if we look at to fiscal 2020, you're going to be maybe starting from that base adding EPS and then adding maybe third of the synergies and then maybe you put mid-single digit growth on your legacy growth. We get something in the mid 1 billion for EBITDA. Is that the right way to think about the earnings power of the [indiscernible] or is there more to that from the inventor or recovery in volume or price or anything like that. Thanks.","Ted Doheny","Well Arun that was a nice way to try to get us to tell you what our future guidance going to be but let me come back to the strategy and were trying to make it easy for you to understand where we're going. And so, if we look at the metrics that were guiding, we're guiding to say we're going to beat the market, we are adjusting this because the market has gotten choppy and so we see to get tapped down, but we want to beat the market. ","How you can get to what the EBITDA looks like is that we are passionate, we are managing, we are controlling what leverage is going to be and so that's why we gave you that 40% look. So, you can look at that grow then put the 40% that's were driving to, that's were talking about, that\u2019s we're paying our people on and that\u2019s in our control that we're going to make it happen. ","Lori Chaitman","Operator, we will take our last question please.","Operator","Okay and our last question comes from Tyler Langton with JP Morgan. Please proceed","Tyler Langton","Good morning, Jim and Lori. Just had a question on reinvent fee I guess just saying the $135 million a benefit this year versus your initial estimate of $70 million. can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that better than expected performance are you achieving savings more quickly as I guess there\u2019s some upside to, I think that to $250 million of total savings that you are expecting over the three years?","Jim Sullivan","Okay I\u2019ll go, just give you quick again reminding of what\u2019 going well and then Jim wants to add some detail there. Remember the reinvent fee and like I\u2019d say it over and over again it\u2019s about we\u2019re reinventing the company everything from how we innovate and sell. ","We\u2019re going after the complete process and we have those we\u2019re now up to nine work stream and we\u2019ve given the top down target but we\u2019ve also have a bottoms up I must say it\u2019s been pretty exciting for me traveling the world we had the boarding here last week. We actually see the largest facility in -","So, we\u2019re feeding up these initiatives that are actually track, we\u2019re tracking and have very good countability for. To your specific question of the buckets that are moving as we shared we saw some inefficiencies when we give the diagnostic now a year ago and we\u2019re seeing that hit the bottom line we talked about this was three divisions, now two divisions or was two divisions now going to one the acting is one company so we see that initiative and you see it on the SG&A line of what we\u2019re driving and how do we delayer the organization.","And that part is measured and managed and we have that track and trace we see it happening. On the operational side we\u2019re seeing some of the yield in the productivity come through. We got teams that are looking for facilities on what we\u2019re doing, how we\u2019re doing our extrusion, how were the productivity, where\u2019s idle time, the metrics if you go to one of our facilities now you don\u2019t have to read a report you see the visual board so I'm not talking about really exciting stuff but that stuff is being measured, it\u2019s being managed and it\u2019s flowing through the bottom line.","And our confidence the track ability and traceability feel really-really good about that. The productivity we\u2019ve seen some coming through on our direct material now I know the questions always come up which going on with resin so we\u2019re breaking that into high level detail of the different types of resins we buy the SKUs and we\u2019re going bit by bit, part number by part number and looking it where what makes sense what doesn\u2019t make sense put a project on it and we\u2019re seeing that tracking and very well. Jim you also want to add in.","Ted Doheny","No I would just say one of my first things coming to the company was kind of eye opening that I\u2019ve been through these kind of processes before and sometimes there\u2019s a lot of consultant speak in that sort of thing and it\u2019s little bit of - but I have to say after being here for a month, I'm very impressed with how this reinvent is being done this transformation is being done.","It\u2019s really very detailed I think what 2000 specific initiatives throughout the company and they\u2019re be in track just all kinds of great work going on here and I think we\u2019re not leaving any stone unturned so yes we are delivering a lot more than what I think the company thought when I got into this company was prudent when it announced what it thought it could achieve coming end of the year, we\u2019re seeing this come through really strong deal in the full year and the first half and being able to commit now that $60 million in the back half of the year really help us offset some of these volume related challenges and product care is really great.","And we do see good opportunities as we turn the calendar in the next year. so, I'm very impressed with what I see and obviously we\u2019ll continue to stay close to the teams doing a great job.","Lori Chaitman","Great thank you Jim, thank you Ted.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode, after the speakers\u2019 presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today\u2019s webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management\u2019s outlook or predictions for future periods are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release and slide presentation, which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website or on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP.

Included in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation, you will find U.S. GAAP financial statements that correspond to some of the non-U.S. GAAP measures we reference throughout the presentation.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ted Doheny, our President and CEO. Ted?","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Lori, and thank all of you for joining us for our earnings call. I\u2019ll start with a quick recap of our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results and discuss the progress we are continuing to make on Reinvent SEE and how it\u2019s transforming Sealed Air.","This is an exciting journey and we look forward to the year ahead. I will conclude with an update on our 2025 sustainability pledge. Jim will expand on our financial results for the quarter and full-year and provide our outlook for 2020. We\u2019ll end the call with Q&A.","Turning now to Slide 3, in the fourth quarter we delivered 9% adjusted EBITDA growth on 3% higher sales compared to last year. Our EBITDA margin expanded by 120 basis points to 20.9% due to productivity improvements from Reinvent SEE, earnings from Automated Packaging Systems acquisition and favorable price\/cost spread.","For 2019 our top line was driven by acquisitions and organic growth in our food business mostly offset by currency translation headwinds and volume weakness in protective packaging. Despite modest sales growth of 1%, we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% and free cash flow of $321 million.","Slide 4, reiterates our vision, our strategy, and how we\u2019re using Reinvent to make this happen. Our vision is to transform Sealed Air from the best packaging company to a world-class company servicing the global packaging industry.","Today, we are the leading innovator in packaging and are making it different in the industries we serve with automation, service and materials. I\u2019m proud of how our global team has embraced Reinvent SEE. We\u2019ve executed well and have delivered strong results in a difficult environment.","We\u2019re reinventing everything we do from how we innovate to how we solve our customer\u2019s toughest challenges. We\u2019re doing this by operating as one Sealed Air and building a high performance culture centered around operational excellence. We will continue to reinvent our powerful Cryovac and Bubble Wrap brands with their new and sustainable innovations.","This will expand our leadership in core markets and allow us to further penetrate adjacent markets. In 2019, we closed three acquisitions that expanded our product portfolio, our geographic presence in food and digital printing capabilities.","Automated Packaging Systems brings us new innovations in automation and sustainability while opening up new markets for food. To expand our presence in the fast growing market in Asia, we made a small yet strategic acquisition in food and finally our disruptive printing technology acquisitions is already helping us improve our digital capabilities and enabling a higher level of automation in the near future.","We\u2019re confident that these acquisitions coupled with the investments we\u2019re making in our core business will accelerate our rate of innovation and growth. Jim will provide more detail but you can see on this slide in 2020, we expect 5% to 7% adjusted EBITDA growth on 2% to 3% higher sales and free cash flow of approximately $350 million.","Let\u2019s now turn to sustainability on Slide 5, which is at the heart of our purpose, to leave the world better than we found it. We\u2019re leading the industry to a more sustainable future and believe it is critical element of our growth strategy. We have a broad portfolio of essential packaging solutions that are designed to reduce food waste, maximize food safety, and protect valuable goods shipped around the world.","We\u2019re focusing on delivering the best products at the right price and making them sustainable. We established aggressive targets as it relates to our recyclability, reusability and recycled content with our 2025 sustainability pledge.","In 2019, we\u2019ve made meaningful progress toward these objectives and have accelerated our innovation rate. By the end of 2023, we expect half of our solutions will be either recyclable or reusable, putting us on track to achieve our objective of reaching 100% by 2025.","In food, the majority of our case ready portfolio has been reinvented to meet recyclability requirements. We continue to redesign our materials to lighten the weight, reduce scrap, and increase recycled and\/or renewable content while maintaining the highest performance standards of our Cryovac brand.","In protective packaging, we\u2019re gaining market share in EMEA with our recycled cushioned mailer and increased demand for paper-based products. We just launched our reinvented Bubble Wrap with 90% recycled content. In summary, sustainability is in everything we do, top of mind for all of our constituents and will fuel our future growth.","Before I pass the call to Jim, I want to share an early assessment of the coronavirus as it pertains to our people and operations. Our top priority is to protect our people and their families, our customers, and our operations from any adverse impacts. We\u2019re taking all precautionary measures as directed by health authorities and the local government.","We have over a thousand employees in eight facilities in China. At this point, thankfully, none of our employees have been affected by the virus. Our five largest facilities are up and running and we\u2019re working with our customers to ensure continuity of supply. The remaining three facilities are in the process of returning to full production.","China accounted for approximately 3% of sales in 2019 and 5% of our global supply. I\u2019ll now pass the call to Jim to review our results in more detail. Jim?","Jim Sullivan","Thank you Ted and good morning everyone. On Slide 6, we\u2019ll start with the review of our net sales by region. In the fourth quarter sales of $1.3 billion increased 3% as reported and 5% in constant dollars. We\u2019ve delivered growth across all regions, which included a full quarter of sales from Automated Packaging Systems.","In constant dollars, North America, our largest region representing 58% of the company\u2019s sales grew 3% year-over-year. EMEA was up 4% and Asia Pacific was up 2%. South America where we have U.S. dollar index pricing was up 31% of which 12% was volume growth. As a reminder, Automated Packaging Systems generate 75% of its sales in North America with 20% in EMEA and the remaining 5% in Asia Pacific.","On Slide 7, you can see our net sales by region for the full year. Similar to the fourth quarter, we had constant dollar growth across all regions. North America was up 4% and EMEA and Asia Pacific were both up 2%. South America was up 27% of which 5% was volume growth.","Turning to Slide 8, here we highlight our organic sales volume and pricing trends by segment and region. In the fourth quarter, overall volume excluding acquisitions was down about 2% driven by a modest decline in Food Care and a 4% decline in Product Care.","Food Care faced market challenges into year-end mainly due to a heavier than expected mix of frozen pork and beef exports into China to alleviate protein supply shortages ahead of the Chinese new year.","Overall Product Care volumes were in-line with our expectations. Product Care volume in North America declined high-single digits, which was a similar trend to what we experienced in the third quarter and it\u2019s to a large extent due to a weak industrial manufacturing environment exacerbated by year-end inventory destocking actions with key distributors.","The decline in North America Product Care was partially offset by volume growth of 3% in both EMEA and Asia Pacific due to strengthen in our value-added portfolio and sustainable solutions. Overall price performance in the quarter and for the year was up modestly primarily driven by U.S. dollar index pricing in South America. In Food Care North America, pricing was down about 2% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to resin based formula pricing.","On Slide 9, we present our year-over-year sales and adjusted EBITDA bridges for the fourth quarter and full-year. Organic sales in the quarter were down 1.6%, for the full year organic sales were flat as volume decline of about 1% was offset by favorable pricing.","Acquisitions contributed $78 million in the fourth quarter and $195 million for the full year. Automated Packaging Systems sales were $70 million in the quarter and $117 million for the five months post acquisition period. Unfavorable currency translation negatively impacted sales in the quarter by 1.5% and for the year by 2.9%.","Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $271 million increased $23 million or 9% compared to last year with the margin up 120 basis points to 20.9%. The adjusted EBITDA increase in the quarter was driven by Reinvent SEE benefits and acquisitions, partially offset by lower organic volume, higher operating costs and unfavorable currency.","Reinvent SEE benefits of $44 million in the fourth quarter included $19 million of restructuring savings, $13 million in price\/cost spread and $12 million in operating costs. In price\/cost spread, we\u2019ve benefited from our Reinvent SEE processes that are structurally lowering our direct materials and transportation costs and increasing value capture.","Higher operating costs in the quarter were largely due to labor and indirect material and services inflation and increased incentive compensation and corporate expense. The increase in corporate expense was driven by currency transaction losses associated with emerging market currencies strengthening against the U.S. dollar.","Reinvent SEE benefits have partially offset these higher operating costs included yield and manufacturing optimization, material substitution and alternative raw material qualifications, SG&A efficiencies and savings on indirect spending.","Adjusted EBITDA from acquisitions was $13 million in the quarter. This was essentially off from Automated Packaging Systems with our cost synergies running ahead of schedule. Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.78 compared to $0.75 in the fourth quarter of 2018, as the year-over-year $23 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a modestly lower share count more than offset higher D&A and interest expense of $17 million mostly related to the acquisitions.","Turning your attention to the full-year EBITDA bridge you can see we realized approximately $168 million of Reinvent SEE benefits in 2019 with $67 million coming from restructuring. Similar to the fourth quarter, the 8% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 130 basis point improvement in margin demonstrates our strong execution of Reinvent SEE.","Throughout the year we also benefited from favorable price\/cost spread and in the second half contribution from the Automated Packaging Systems acquisition. Adjusted EPS was $2.82 for the full year 2019, which included $0.04 dilution from the Automated Packaging Systems acquisition.","The average diluted shares outstanding were 155 million. This compares to adjusted EPS of $2.50 for the full year 2018 based on 160 million diluted shares outstanding. The adjusted tax rate was 26.4% for the full year 2019 compared to 27.5% in 2018.","Turning to Slide 10, here we highlight our total Reinvent SEE benefits in 2019 and what we expect for 2020 and 2021. As mentioned, total benefits in 2019 were $168 million which exceeded our previous guidance of approximately $150 million and more than offset our volume shortfall.","In 2020, we expect Reinvent SEE to contribute approximately $110 million of incremental benefits to adjusted EBITDA, of which roughly half will flow through from actions taken in 2019 and the other half will come from new actions.","Given our success to-date, along with the initiatives currently being implemented and in our planning pipeline, we now anticipate over the three year period ending in 2021 we will realize approximately $330 million of Reinvent SEE benefits. Cash restructuring payments associated with Reinvent SEE were $91 million in 2019 and are expected to be approximately a $100 million in 2020 and $25 million in 2021.","So we are on track with our original Reinvent SEE cash investment of approximately $215 million and now expect to exceed our adjusted EBITDA benefits commitment by approximately $80 million.","Turning to segment results on Slide 11 starting with Food Care, in the fourth quarter, Food Care net sales of $760 million, were down $12 million or 2% as reported but up $5 million or 60 basis points in constant dollars as currency continued to weigh on top line results in this segment in particular.","Despite the decline in sales, adjusted EBITDA in Food Care increased $9 million or 5% to $171 million with the margin improving 150 basis points to 22.5%. Global protein markets were up modestly in the quarter compared to our volumes, which were down 40 basis points.","South America delivered higher-than-anticipated volume growth of 12% as we continue to benefit from this market shifting from unpackaged to packaged beef format, which is being fueled by strength in their export market. Growth in South America was offset by volume declines in other regions.","As previously noted, starting in the later part of the fourth quarter, China aggressively bought frozen pork from North America and frozen beef from Australia in polyline boxes instead of bags and packages as a way to quickly address their protein shortage in advance of the Chinese New Year.","This dynamic impacted our sales volumes with North America down nearly 1% and Asia Pacific down 2%. We had anticipated low-single-digit volume growth in both regions heading into the quarter. EMEA was broadly impacted by the weak economic environment with volume declines in the UK, Germany, and France.","Looking ahead, the global protein markets are expected to be approximately flat in 2020 driven by favorable protein production in North America and South America offset by declines in Asia Pacific.","For our Food Care segment in 2020, we expect approximately 1.5% constant dollar growth with volumes up approximately 2% partially offset by unfavorable pricing from resin-based formulas in North America, particularly in the first half of the year.","Our above market sales growth will be driven by increased demand for new products including our sustainable Plantic and Darfresh offerings, our FlexPrep and vertical pouches for fluids and strength in equipment sales.","On Slide 12, we highlight results from our Product Care segment. In the fourth quarter, Product Care net sales of $539 million were up $50 million or 10% as reported. Organic sales were down 3.5%. Adjusted EBITDA of $107 million increased $22 million or 25% including a $13 million contribution from Automated Packaging Systems.","Product Care\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.8% expanded 230 basis points year-over-year. Product Care\u2019s value-added solutions portfolio which represents about a third of the segment\u2019s sales delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter and for the full year. This portfolio includes our inflatables, automated systems, paper systems, Korrvu and temperature controlled packaging.","As a reminder, we are also including Automated Packaging Systems sales in this value-added solution sub-segment. Growth in value-added solutions in the quarter was more than offset by an approximate 7% decline in industrial applications and a 6% decline in traditional packaging, which taken together account for the remaining two thirds of Product Care sales.","Both of these product categories have higher cyclical exposure to the industrial manufacturing and transportation sectors, which are currently relatively weak, but are positioned well to benefit when the cycle rebounds. Additionally, in traditional packaging, the available market for void fill applications is declining as our customers automate their processes, rightsize their packaging and eliminate waste.","In 2020, we expect Product Care sales to increase approximately 7% on a constant dollar basis, including about $170 million of incremental sales from Automated Packaging Systems during the first seven months of the year. On an organic basis, Product Care sales are expected to decline approximately 2%.","This outlook assumes a continued decline in traditional packaging and to a lesser extent industrial applications as we anticipate some stabilization in the industrial manufacturing environment following inventory destocking at key distributors in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. These declines will be partially offset by continued growth in our value added solutions portfolio.","We are encouraged by Product Care sales increases in the fourth quarter in EMEA and Asia Pacific and expect these trends to continue in 2020. We also expect cross selling opportunities with Automated Packaging Systems across our global network. We expect these to materialize in the second half of the year.","Now let\u2019s turn to free cash flow on Slide 13. Our heightened focus on cash generation is paying off as we ended the year very strong and delivered $321 million of free cash flow well above guidance and 2018 results.","The year-over-year free cash flow improvement was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower working capital levels and reduced cash tax payments, partially offset by increased capital expenditures and Reinvent SEE cash restructuring payments.","Net debt at the end of the year totaled approximately $3.6 billion pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.6x, which is at the lower end of our 3.5x to 4x target range and better than previously expected due to the higher cash generation.","In November, we successfully refinanced our $425 million, 6.5% bonds due December, 2020 with new eight year bonds at a very attractive 4% rate. With this transaction our annual interest expense in 2020 will be on par with 2019 despite having an incremental seven months of interest expense from the term loan we took on to finance the Automated Packaging Systems acquisition.","Turning to our 2020 outlook on Slide 14, we anticipate net sales to increase in the range of 2% to 3% as reported or $4.9 billion to $4.95 billion. On a constant dollar basis, net sales are expected to increase 3% to 4%. As noted earlier Food Care and Product Care are expected to deliver approximately 1.5% and 7% growth in constant dollars respectively.","Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.03 billion which at the mid-point would equate to an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 20.7%. Incremental Reinvent SEE benefits of $110 million and adjusted EBITDA from acquisitions of $25 million will be partially offset by inflationary cost increases, negative price\/cost spread in Food Care mostly in the first half of the year driven by resin-based formula price declines in a favorable currency translation.","In 2020, on average we are assuming that raw materials and freight will be relatively flat as compared to 2019. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $215 million as compared to $185 million in 2019. The $30 million a year-over-year increase is driven by the 2019 acquisitions, recent higher CapEx levels and an increase in stock compensation as Reinvent SEE drove stock forfeitures in 2019 that are not expected to be repeated in 2020.","We expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95. Our outlook for adjusted EPS is based on approximately 156 million shares outstanding and does not assume additional share repurchases. The adjusted tax rate in 2020 is expected to be about 27%.","For free cash flow, we expect to generate approximately $350 million. This is net of capital expenditures of approximately $200 million or 4% of sales and Reinvent SEE restructuring and associated payments of approximately a $100 million.","Beyond 2021, post implementation, Reinvent SEE will be the engine of our business system that drives profitable growth and mitigate annual inflationary costs without further incremental investment.","Let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks. Ted?","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Jim. Operator, if you could turn to Slide 15. As we head into 2020 it\u2019s clear we\u2019re well on our way to achieving our vision of becoming a world class company serving the packaging industry. As illustrated on Slide 15, you can see how we\u2019re reinventing our powerful brands and operating as one company. The four P\u2019s of Reinvent SEE are our guide. Going forward, we\u2019ll continue to focus on our performance like delivering new and sustainable products to our markets faster and breaking into attractive adjacent markets.","This will ensure that we grow faster than the markets we serve. Our success will be dependent on our people, operating as one Sealed Air with a focus on growth and productivity, as well as developing, retaining, and attracting the best and brightest talent.","From a product perspective, our goal to deliver the best products, get the right price and make them sustainable is resonating with our customers. We\u2019ve made significant progress on our processes. Operational disciplines are becoming embedded in the organization and demonstrating sustained results.","We will lead in sustainability by bringing value to our customers while helping them meet their own sustainability goals. We\u2019re excited for what\u2019s ahead and as always we\u2019ll focus on what is in our control.","With that, I\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator, we\u2019d like to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hey, good morning guys. Just a question on the Food Care volume outlook. I think you said you expect the global protein market to be flat, but for Sealed Air to grow volumes 2%, just given the fourth quarter number was a little bit below the market, just wondering what gives you the confidence to say that you\u2019ll have the ability to outgrow the market by 200 basis points or so. And I just related to that, wondered if you could provide some more details on the small strategic acquisition you did in Food Care.","Ted Doheny","First we\u2019ll talk about North America, as we\u2019ve seen some of our customers reporting, we\u2019re expecting the North American production to be up around 2% in next year. We do expect there\u2019s going to be some choppiness as we\u2019ve highlighted going into - in the fourth quarter and what\u2019s going on with China right now. But we think in the second half of the year we should see the growth that we have out there, so we feel good about that.","The dynamic that we\u2019ve been talking about with what\u2019s happened in the pork market with frozen exports, we do think that will be a rebound specially we\u2019re working directly with our customers right now both from the U.S. and as well as from South America.","Right now we\u2019re not getting most of that frozen business, but we think over the year that will convert back to fresh and we think we even have some opportunities to get participate in that frozen export business.","On the second question on the small acquisition in Food Care, that\u2019s a geographic acquisition that we made in the Philippines that actually is exceeding expectations. It\u2019s small, it\u2019s less than $10 million, but it\u2019s giving us that local presence that we need in that fast growing market.","Jim Sullivan","And Brian this is Jim. Just to add a little bit to the above-market growth in food. We do have new products that we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll start to have traction in the market. We talked in the comments about the sustainable Plantic and Darfresh offerings as well as our new FlexPrep vertical pouches for fluids. And in addition, we have a strong backlog of equipment orders that we expect to deliver in 2020. So it gives us high confidence given the backlog that we can deliver there.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi","Hey, guys, good morning. Just as a follow-up to Brian\u2019s question on the Food Care volume assumptions, can you just kind of break that out between the regions to Australia with the wild fire \u2013 with the fire impact and so on? What are you thinking about that market? And then second, on the EBITDA bridge, between $965 million in 2019 and call it $1.02 billion at the midpoint, you\u2019ve given us some of the moving parts with Reinvent SEE savings and APS and FX, but what about price\/cost and also operating costs? How should we think about those moving parts? Thank you.","Jim Sullivan","Okay. Let me take the numbers question and then Ted will take the question on the regional sales expectation for 2020. So we\u2019re looking at about, let\u2019s call it $55 million of higher EBITDA in 2020 versus what we delivered in 2019. $110 million as we laid out is coming from Reinvest, so that\u2019s a positive. Incrementally for APS, seven months, having APS in the portfolio for a full year will help by about 25. So We\u2019re up 135. You ask yourself, well, how do you get back down to that 55? Well, it\u2019s inflation is a big part of the reduction. That\u2019s about $50 million.","And then we talked about negative price\/cost spread in Food Care in particular, driven by the formulas. So keep in mind, the formulas are driven off of the resin profile that the company experienced in 2019. And those will be passed \u2013 some of those gains in 2019 will be passed through these formulas as we talked about, mostly in the first half of 2020. So together between inflation and, call it, net price\/cost spread, that\u2019s about, let\u2019s call it, $70-ish million. And then the remaining $10 million is unfavorable currency. We talked about currency at the top line being less than it was in 2019 versus 2018 but still a drag, $40 million sales and about $10 million of EBITDA.","Ted Doheny","Okay. Thanks, Jim. And Ghansham, going back to \u2013 on the Food Care piece and building off the previous question and our confidence why we think we can get that 2% growth. I just want to reiterate again, the first quarter, probably even the second quarter, there\u2019s going to be some choppiness as we\u2019re working through some issues. But we do expect to see growth in North America. And as we \u2013 especially as the North America, we\u2019re seeing growth from our customers. But also, you\u2019ve seen some of our customers talk about the automation.","We do have some line of sight to that equipment business. We see some of that equipment business clearly in 2020, so that\u2019s giving us confidence in North America. We also are seeing some penetration in some of our adjacent markets in that being in our liquids business and also the alternative proteins, and we\u2019re all seeing some growth in seafood. Again, those are small, but we are seeing that growth beneath and coming through in North America.","To your question on the fires in Australia, we do see Australia that is trying to cover that market through into China. We do expect some of this market to return, probably more again on the second half. But we are \u2013 the growth in Australia will not be there because that herd continues to be reduced. We do see strength, still, in South America. We\u2019re doing well. We even see more potential in South America. Quite excited about what we can do and continue that growth in South America into 2020.","So net-net, we do have some challenges out there that we\u2019ve identified. We do think we can recover the growth in our Food Care, so we think we definitely have a doable guidance out there for 2020.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I wanted to spend my question on Product Care. So recognizing it\u2019s hard, ultimately, to call the future, Ted, when do you think, with your traditional markets shrinking, particularly the traditional void fill for various reasons, that between the sales of your more value-added products and anything else that you have in the pipeline or that you\u2019re thinking about, that your volume growth within Product Care will cross over and turn more positively? Is that really likely in 2021? Or is it too hard to call that given all the secular issues that you\u2019re seeing in traditional void fill markets? Relatedly, if you could mention to us a bit in terms of how Instapak is doing.","I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not doing great given the industrial exposure. But what are you doing to \u2013 because it\u2019s such a good product line for you, what are you doing to have it sort of break out of industrial? And then as we put it all together, combining Reinvent, combining whatever volume and price\/cost trends you\u2019re seeing, when should we see or can we continue to look to improving EBITDA growth in this segment in spite of the headwind on volume because of what you\u2019ve going on from Reinvent? Thank you and good luck in the quarter.","Ted Doheny","Okay. Thanks, George. I\u2019m going to get Jim to tag team some of this with me so I make sure I got all the questions there. Well, I\u2019m going to go through first on the Product Care, then I\u2019ll go through the Instapak of what we\u2019re doing. And then only because \u2013 Jim, you could jump in on where we see the Reinvent going forward on the price\/cost spread.","So, first, on the Product Care, I think we do see it turning. We still \u2013 for next year, we\u2019re seeing organic down 2%. And so if we break up our portfolio, we have seen some gains with our new products, just not fast enough. We\u2019re actually using this \u2013 I keep saying it over and over again, best product, right price, make it sustainability \u2013 the sustainability to help drive that portfolio. We have seen success in our paper products. We have seen that move, still not enough.","What I feel good about North America, actually, you have to look into Europe and see what the EMEA team has done. Similar conditions, they actually got growth in 2019 with their new products, redesigned the mailer to a recycled content, bringing in the paper products. So we just have more work to do. And plus, in Europe, they got growth in the e-commerce with an automated solution. So in the Product Care, I think the 2%, we have to do it internally, our numbers I think have turned. You asked specifically, is it 2020. I\u2019d like to underpromise and overdeliver that I think we can do that.","The other key piece on Product Care that we are seeing move ahead is what the acquisition with Automated Packaging Systems, which internally, we\u2019re using their name and calling it Automated. That\u2019s where the market is going. Our customers are looking. Can you help us with automation? They can\u2019t get labor. And their product lead on that has really helped and actually learning from them in the acquisition what we can do with \u2013 especially our equipment piece there with Product Care. So long answer, simple question, don\u2019t think we\u2019re not planning on that to turn positive in 2020, 2021. We better and see if we can pull that forward.","The next question you had was on Instapak. And I do appreciate George\u2019s comment, it\u2019s a tremendous product. So with Instapak, we get penalized there right now as we had the chemical that\u2019s in there to make that such a great product. We\u2019ve been working hard. Can we take their costs down as we\u2019ve done with some of our other products? We\u2019ve got some cost out issues there that I think we can take care of.","It ties directly with the industrial market, though. And with the industrial market down, so is Instapak with its market-leading position. We are looking at reinventing that product, and we have to make that happen. But we think, with the industrial churn, Instapak will come on and match that return quite quickly. So confident that will turn, but we have more internal things to work on that as well.","Jim, do you want to handle the Reinvent if you remember his first question from way back?","Jim Sullivan","Sure. And George, I think despite the fact that we had organic volume decline across the year in Product Care, let\u2019s call it, 4% total \u2013 or 3.5% with a little bit more on volume, we were able to improve margins from 17.5% to 18.3%. So even in this segment, we are seeing the benefits of Reinvent SEE drive \u2013 more than drive through the negative impact from volume.","Now we did have a favorable price\/cost spread in 2019 versus 2018 that we would not expect to repeat in 2020. So having said that, we do think that the margin within that business will continue to improve and likely end closer to 18.5% for the full year next year. So not a huge improvement from where we ended year-to-date in 2019, but still a modest improvement. And again, it\u2019s driven by the Reinvent contribution as well as APS.","Recall when we acquired APS, the margin in that business was roughly 14%. And we recognize that there was an opportunity, if you will to reinvest their cost structure. And we made good progress in 2019, we guided up closer to 17% by the exit point in 2019, and we would expect that to continue to improve in 2020. It will still be close \u2013 by the end of 2020, close to the average for the segment, which is really good.","So again, next year, we can\u2019t count on \u2013 in 2020, we can\u2019t count on favorable price\/cost spread. We\u2019re looking at the flattish raw material and freight profile and pricing. There will be some drag there, not a lot, but then you\u2019ve got the Reinvent benefits coming through that line as well. So overall, I think the company is doing a pretty nice job in this difficult volume environment, holding margins and slightly \u2013 and even slightly improving it.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc.","Adam Josephson","Ted and Jim, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Jim, just in terms of the cadence of volumes for the year, it sounds like you\u2019re expecting Food Care volumes to get better, particularly in the second half because I think Ted referred to some expected choppiness in the first half as you transition from fresh to frozen.","I think, in Product Care, you\u2019re talking about expecting some stabilization in global industrial activity but it sounds like that\u2019s also more of a second half phenomenon, correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Can you just help me with how back half weighted you expect this volume recovery to be just across the company? And any impact from coronavirus that you\u2019re expecting in the first quarter specifically?","Ted Doheny","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. I think we would probably say, based on what we know today, that there\u2019s likely some push out of Q1 into Q2 due to the coronavirus. We did have talked \u2013 we did have some facilities down. Transportation is not moving really well right now in China. We do think, as we sit here today, though, that it\u2019s just a movement within quarters and not a issue for the full year.","Obviously, it\u2019s a developing issue, and we\u2019ll have to stay close to it. So I think it\u2019s a fair comment on Q1. Probably, overall, Food Care in the first half of the year is going to be in that 1% range on volume. And stronger than that in the back half of the year as some of these equipment orders I talked about that are in our backlog are scheduled to deliver as well as some of the new products. So, overall, in the back half of the year, slightly above 2%. So a little bit of sequential strength in volume in Food Care.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rosemarie Morbelli with G.Research.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about the reason behind no longer ceasing operations in one of your manufacturing facility. And then your lack of presence, if I can qualify it like that, in the frozen food market, why aren\u2019t you in it? And then how do you expect to get into it?","Ted Doheny","Could you just help, the first part, I got the why frozen food is impacting us, got that question. The first part just came through \u2013 we couldn\u2019t hear.","Rosemarie Morbelli","Sure. It looks as though you are no longer going to cease operation in one manufacturing facility. Could you give us some detail as to why, first, you were planning in closing it down and now you decided not to? Unless I read \u2013 unless I misread it.","Ted Doheny","Are you talking about the comments on the coronavirus?","Rosemarie Morbelli","No, no. It was a comment on your \u2013 in the press release. It\u2019s all right. I can get back to it offline.","Lori Chaitman","Rosemarie, I\u2019ll take \u2013 yes, I\u2019ll take that offline. It seems we\u2019re not sure to what you\u2019re referencing.","Jim Sullivan","If you\u2019re talking about the credit on restructuring that occurred in the quarter, yes. When the company originally set up its reserves and it anticipated that it would shutter a facility in that region and as we got further into the implementation, the margins of that business and the cost structure of that facility and through some local sourcing that we did, we were able to improve dramatically the economics.","And therefore, we decided that it didn\u2019t make sense for us to go ahead and follow through on that action. So we reversed that restructuring into the GAAP results for the quarter. Of course, that\u2019s called out as a special item, it\u2019s not in our non-GAAP results. If that\u2019s what the question was.","Ted Doheny","Okay. Yes. And Rosemarie, I\u2019ll take the frozen one. Thank you, Jim. The question on why the frozen versus fresh is affecting us. It\u2019s a good question. The protective packaging that we have with our Cryovac brand is what we offer is tremendous barrier protection on fresh meat, fresh proteins. When you go to \u2013 when you freeze it, you\u2019d use a simpler structure that doesn\u2019t use the same level of per barrier protection that the Cryovac brand has. So hence, that is not a strong market for us.","How these dynamics are working, though, it\u2019s quite interesting as trying to serve that China market quickly because of the issues, first with the swine fever, now with the coronavirus on how to get protein to that market quickly. It did shift heavy to frozen. But in the process, especially in Latin America, we have a strong presence and we\u2019re at the table with the larger meat producers. They were using our bags to actually freeze.","Also, when they\u2019re freezing, they\u2019re freezing larger carcasses. So they, again, wanted our protective capability in our barrier bags. So in the short-term, it actually \u2013 going frozen doesn\u2019t support the product lines we have. Though, in the long-term, it will, because fresh is what is preferred. And even if they stay frozen, we\u2019re in there in the automation change and we think where there\u2019s some growth opportunities. So it\u2019s really a short-term phenomenon. But we\u2019re at the table and we think this will be a growth opportunity for us, probably more in the second half of the year than the first half.","Lori Chaitman","And, Rosemarie, happy to take more clarification questions offline on that first question. Operator, we can take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi, good morning.","Ted Doheny","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari","Ted, you referenced some of the success that you\u2019re seeing with paper-based solutions. I was wondering if it was possible to quantify how big that paper-based product set is for you or how big that opportunity is. And I guess we typically think of Sealed as a resin-based packager. Is paper something that you\u2019re making significant growth investments in? Or is it something where you could even potentially look to acquire?","Ted Doheny","Yes, probably don\u2019t have the actual numbers, but I\u2019ll just tell you how it fits in. The \u2013 we\u2019ve had \u2013 we actually have had paper-based products for quite some time, and paper shows up in a lot of our products. Korrvu products is actually a cardboard solution with a film inside. Our mailers, we have a multiple set of different mailers with paper. The paper fill, very specifically, is paper for void fill, which is the paper versus plastic decision versus a Bubble Wrap opportunity.","So with the question on plastics versus paper, which we believe it\u2019s actually going to probably drive even more of our Bubble Wrap solutions by giving the market a choice, paper versus plastic. So as far as the percentage, and probably Lori can follow-up with you the exact percentage, but rather than give you a number right now, we can follow-up with that. We are seeing its growth, though, as we\u2019ve introduced new paper products, growing. And I\u2019d just rather not quote the wrong number. We can follow-up with you on that.","Jim Sullivan","Yes. Let me just go ahead and jump in. I think I can give a bit of a dimension there, Ted. So if you look at straight paper, it\u2019s a pretty small percentage, low single-digit percentage of the total Product Care sales, but we do have paper that\u2019s in some of our mailers. So mailers would probably bring that up to mid-single digit part of the Product Care portfolio growing faster.","Anthony Pettinari","And it\u2019s also in the Korrvu products, et cetera, et cetera.","Jim Sullivan","Yes.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley.","Neel Kumar","Thanks for taking my question. In Product Care, just in terms of your expectation of stabilization in the industrial markets following inventory destocking, can you just talk about what gives you confidence that the inventory destocking is, in fact, over? And what are you seeing in terms of underlying demand trends in the industrial space so far in the first quarter?","Ted Doheny","Well, the first quarter right now is choppy for us around the world for what\u2019s going on right now in China. But in the U.S., what gives us confidence is we\u2019ve seen that slowing down. Plus, in looking deeper into the portfolio, we think some of our new products can help us fight some of that, the secular decline that, as you\u2019ve highlighted, is out there. So we\u2019re seeing that.","And as I highlighted earlier to a previous question, we\u2019re seeing what we\u2019ve been able to do in Europe and move faster, so we think bringing our new products in, in the sustainability play, we think we still have an opportunity to turn that quicker. And the question was asked before, not seeing it turn to 2021, but we think we have an opportunity. And then the third area, just to highlight again, our acquisition of APS was one of the product gaps we had there in that portfolio in the automation, the equipment, the auto bag product, the side pouch. So, we think filling that product gap portfolio will help turn that quicker and see if we can actually turn that to a positive before 2021.","Jim Sullivan","And I would just add that we have talked directly with our key distributors, and they\u2019ve indicated to us that they have been doing destocking. So, their underlying sales rate is at a better rate, if you will, than what we\u2019re posting because of the destocking. So, it\u2019s really a combination of what we can observe directly through those discussions as well as our own internal data seems to be stabilizing, albeit at a level that\u2019s not where we want it to be longer term.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Ted, Jim, Lori.","Ted Doheny","Good morning, mark.","Mark Wilde","I wondered, Ted, if it\u2019s possible to just give us some sense with Reinvent SEE of where you\u2019re seeing the upside. And then just as a follow-on, I know that you\u2019ve been trying to kind of reengineer the relationships on the distribution side for Product Care, so I wondered if you could just give us an update on that.","Ted Doheny","Sure. The first question is where we see the upside on Reinvent. Obviously, as we\u2019ve been talking about since we\u2019ve introduced it, the upside is we\u2019re actually performing better than we had planned, and we want to continue that into 2020. One of the areas that we brought in to Reinvent is, really, could we bring the same discipline that we put in our cost structure and actually bringing it into the growth of our business as well. And what I mean by that is the tracking and tracing of initiatives that we do on cost, bringing that into our new product development, bringing that even into our sales opportunities. And so that\u2019s underway, we put that in place in the fourth quarter.","So I think that same discipline that\u2019s been driving our effectiveness on our cost structure, I think \u2013 I\u2019m pretty optimistic we\u2019ll see that benefit in 2020, and we need it. As far as moving, your second part of your question, on where we are with our \u2013 or how we go-to-market in our Product Care business. It \u2013 the first, you\u2019ve heard me mention and somewhat repetitive, best product, right price and make it sustainable.","So, really working with our sales channels to make sure that we truly do have the best product. And the right price is really working with our customers through our distributors, through our channel partners. If we don\u2019t have the right price, what do we do to look for more savings in their operations and also what other products do we need to bring in to the market? So that\u2019s helping us. But also, being clear and direct with our channels, that the channels have to perform.","And as we\u2019re reinventing everything, it\u2019s how we go to market. We have actually an e-commerce platform that we\u2019re piloting that\u2019s actually working ahead of schedule to make it easier to do business with, so our customers can actually connect with us online and use our service team, our distribution team, our direct team to really support and service our customers and the geographies where we serve.","So, we\u2019re making progress, Mark. I\u2019m never happy we\u2019re moving fast enough, but we\u2019re \u2013 I think with our Product Care structure on the whole thing of how we go to market, how we make it and how we develop these new products, I think we have lots of opportunities to lots of opportunities to turn that tide around sooner rather than later.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, I think we have time for two more questions, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","Great, thanks. good morning. I just wanted to ask about the guidance, specifically. If you look at the EBITDA this year, $965 million going to $1.02 billion at the midpoint next year. That\u2019s about $55 million of growth. It looks like you\u2019ve assessed around $25 million for the acquisition. And so the other year-on-year $30 million improvement, I guess, FX, you\u2019re saying negative eight. Assuming that the organic side maybe offsets that, is the other $30 million mainly in restructuring savings? Or how are you thinking about the bridge from 2019 to 2020? It would seem that there\u2019s maybe a little bit more upside there, maybe on the price\/cost side, if those resin prices continue to be benign. Is that right?","Ted Doheny","Well, keep in mind that the formula pricing is really driven by what we experienced in 2019. We are expecting kind of a stable resin environment in 2020. So yes, I think you had most of the bridge items we talked about earlier, $110 million of Reinvent SEE and APS being $25 million. With the takeaway, it\u2019s largely being inflation of about $50 million and net price\/cost spread of about $20 million. And then you hit on the unfavorable currency of $8 million to $10 million. So that kind of gets you to the midpoint. Again, if you look at our consolidated sales, there\u2019s not a lot of what I\u2019ll call sales upside beyond what we\u2019re consolidating in with APS.","Organically, volumes were up 0.5% consolidated. And that\u2019s offset by this formula pricing. So that\u2019s kind of the way we laid it out. We tried to do it kind of middle of the road, tend to be a little bit conservative here. But hopefully, hopefully, we beat the numbers in the market, especially in the Product Care business, where we are really being impacted by a weak manufacturing economy. A big chunk of the Product Care is cyclical and we\u2019re not benefiting from the cycle now. But when that turns, we would expect to see nice incremental margins on the pickup in sales there.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, we\u2019ll take our last question. I think we have one more in the queue.","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. Our next question is from Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies.","Daniel Rizzo","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in guys. Just question on \u2013 with the push in the frozen you guys kind of discussed, I mean, given that it\u2019s kind of an easier product, would that suggest that there\u2019s going to be kind of a mix headwind as you head into 2020 and 2021?","Ted Doheny","No, not for us, because where us because where they want to use our products, they\u2019re \u2013 if I can describe it clearly, where they\u2019re using us now for our product on the frozen, they\u2019re using larger carcasses, that then bigger pieces. So they want our protection, they want our barrier capabilities and also trusted supply. So that\u2019s not a margin mix, actually, it\u2019s an opportunity for us. We don\u2019t really compete on the very simple poly bag in a box for the frozen market, that\u2019s very \u2013 that\u2019s low margin, that\u2019s something that we don\u2019t compete in right now. But when they use our products when they go frozen, that will not be a margin hit for us at all.","Lori Chaitman","So, operator, we\u2019re going to close our call. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you in the near future and safe travels to all.","Operator","Thank you.

We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled forward-looking statements in our earnings release and slide presentation, which applies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website or on the SEC's website at sec.gov.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP.

Ted?","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Lori. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end conference call. I'm going to begin with a recap of our 2018 results. I will then go into more detail about our progress on Reinvent SEE. I'll also highlight our commitment to lead the packaging industry to more sustainable future and our recent commitment to join the Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Bill will then expand on the financial results for the quarter and the year. I'll provide our outlook for 2019, then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.","As we headed into year-end, we focused on executing stranded cost savings initiatives and implementing our new Reinvent SEE vision, which we announced in December. These efforts enabled us to deliver on our 20% operating leverage commitment for 2018 and even higher leverage in the fourth quarter at 31% despite currency headwinds and higher input cost. For the full-year, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% on sales growth of 6%. Higher adjusted EBITDA, a lower tax rate and share repurchases resulted in earnings per share of $2.50, an increase of 38% over 2017. As Bill will discuss shortly, free cash flow was lower than expected due to working capital performance. ","Overall, we're making progress and we will build on this momentum by continuing to execute on Reinvent SEE. We are reinventing the Company to take us to world-class performance. Reinvent SEE is the transformation catalyst that will drive growth above the markets we serve. We will embed our Sealed Air Operational Excellence across the entire Company. We'll improve how we innovate, buy, make and sell. To ensure our successful execution, we are addressing the following key areas. First, speed to market on innovations. We're investing in technology and resources focusing on high-growth markets with sustainable solutions. ","We expect to double our innovation rate over the next five years and that will reward us with profitable growth in new and existing markets. Next, drive channel optimization while improving customer experience. We'll implement value capture pricing to reduce margin leakage and improved sales productivity. We will leverage our extensive distributor network to better align with our growth strategy in changing end-market dynamics. We are investing in digital customer service systems and processes to enhance customer experience and reduce cycle time making every customer a reference. Another area, product cost efficiency. ","We're going after opportunities in procurement, conversion cost productivity, materials yield, SKU rationalization and network efficiency. And finally, drive SG&A productivity by simplifying our structure and operating as one Sealed Air. We're creating a more nimble, efficient and productive organization that will drive higher speed for new innovations, enable more effective global go-to-market strategy and further enhance customers' experience. ","A critical step to making this happen is moving to one commercial team for our two divisions under Karl Deily, who I'm excited to have serve as our Chief Commercial Officer for one Sealed Air. Our strategy for Sealed Air is to grow faster than the markets we serve, deliver earnings power with operating leverage above 40% and have a disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive economic value.","Let me now shift to an important topic embedded in our strategy, sustainability and how we're making a positive impact on our society. Last quarter, I spoke to you about our new sustainability and plastics pledge, committing to deliver 100% recyclable or reusable offerings and 50% recycled content by 2025. We're accelerating our innovations that enable us to achieve this commitment. We're also collaborating with partners around the world to increase recycling and reuse rates. Since then, we've aligned our innovation and sustainability teams to drive actions necessary to exceed our goals.","We recently became a member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste that was first introduced in January. This alliance has a goal to help end plastic waste in the environment over the next five years. We will collaborate with members across the value chain from material suppliers to waste management companies to jointly develop solutions that minimize and manage plastic waste as well as promote means to use the power of plastics more effectively in the circular economy.","I'll now pass the call to Bill to review our results in more detail. Bill?","Bill Stiehl","Thank you, Ted. Let's start with a review of our net sales by region on slide 6. In the fourth quarter, sales increased 3% as reported and 7% in constant dollars. We delivered constant dollar growth across all regions with 7% growth in North America, 2% in EMEA and 4% in Asia-Pacific. ","In Latin America, constant dollar growth of 17% was largely driven by U.S.-based dollar pricing. Volumes in Latin America declined slightly for the first time in five quarters primarily due to a tough year-over-year comp in Food Care. North America Food Care was up 4% in constant dollars as a result of 2% volume growth and 2% favorable price mix trends. Product Care was up 12% in North America largely driven by the AFP acquisition. Excluding the acquisition and currency, Product Care North America was up 4% and volume growth of 3%. In EMEA, we experienced positive sales trends in Germany, France and in Russia. Strength in Asia-Pacific was largely driven by growth in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.","Slide 7 illustrates net sales by region for the full-year. North America increased 6% in constant dollars with Food Care up 3% and Product Care up 9%. Excluding acquisitions, Product Care North America was up 5%. EMEA increased 3% led by favorable trends in the UK, Italy, Germany and Russia. Asia-Pacific was up 12% due to Product Care acquisitions, increased demand in Asia for packaged proteins and higher slaughter rates in Australia related to weather conditions. In Latin America, constant dollar growth of 17% was due to positive price realization to offset currency devaluation and 6% volume growth. Higher volumes in the first nine months of the year were related to a recovery in the protein market and ramp-up of new customer wins.","Slide 8 highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. In the fourth quarter and for the full-year, on a global basis, we delivered favorable price mix of 3% and volume growth of 2%. Price mix was favorable in Food Care and Product Care due to previously announced price increases, formula pass-throughs and continued shift to value added solutions. Food Care delivered 2% to 3% volume growth throughout the year. ","Product Care ended the year with relatively stable volumes as growth in value-added e-commerce solutions were offset by declines in our non-differentiated product offerings. Beginning in the first quarter 2019, we will report pricing as a stand-alone metric, we will move mix into volume. This change will provide us with more insight on business demand trends as well as how our pricing strategies are progressing.","On slide 9, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the fourth quarter. I covered sales trends in the last two slides. So my comments will focus on EBITDA performance. Adjusted EBITDA of $248 million increased 9% on a constant dollar basis. Margins were up 30 basis points and 19.7%. We delivered favorable mix and price cost spread of $15 million and volume growth of $5 million. We realized $13 million of restructuring savings which offset $11 million of higher operating costs. Our efforts to eliminate stranded costs are largely behind us now and Reinvent SEE initiatives are under way to drive productivity improvements. Unfavorable currency was $12 million. Despite currency headwinds and higher input costs relative to last year, we delivered 31% operating leverage or what we define as our profit to growth ratio. Adjusted EPS was $0.75 on average diluted shares outstanding of 156 million shares. Our adjusted tax rate was 29% in the fourth quarter.","Slide 10 displays our sales and EBITDA bridge for the full-year. As illustrated on the net sales bridge, our top line growth was driven by favorable volume and price mix trends and Product Care acquisitions. This was offset by $44 million in currency headwinds that weighed in on our second half performance. EBITDA results were driven by higher volumes, favorable mix and price cost spread as well as restructuring savings partially offset by higher operating costs as well as currency. ","Adjusted earnings per share was $2.50 based upon average diluted shares outstanding of 160 million shares. We repurchased 15 million shares in 2018 valued at $651 million through a combination of open market and the completion of an accelerated share repurchase program. There is $775 million remaining under the current Board of Directors authorization. Our adjusted tax rate in 2018 was 27.5%. This compares to our adjusted tax rate of 30% in 2017. For 2019, we expect a 150 basis point reduction in our adjusted tax rate to 26%. The anticipated decline in our adjusted tax rate is related to optimization of our post-Diversey domestic and foreign legal entity structure.","Now let's turn to our results by division. On slide 11, we present Q4 and full-year results for Food Care. We were very pleased with Food Care's results in the fourth quarter in light of currency headwinds. Sales of $772 million were up 6% in constant dollars due to 2% higher volumes and 4% favorable price mix. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% in constant dollars to $162 million. Margins improved 210 basis points to 21% of net sales. For the full-year in constant dollars, Food Care delivered 10% adjusted EBITDA growth on 5% sales growth. Margins improved 80 basis points to 20% of sales. ","Food Care delivered strong operating leverage in the quarter and in the year due to higher sales growth, our efforts to eliminate stranded costs and Reinvent SEE actions that are already under way. The global protein markets were up in the low-single digits in the fourth quarter and for the full-year. Food Care volume was up in all regions with global volume growth of 2% to 3% throughout the year due to increasing demand across our core product portfolio and continued market penetration of our new innovations. By region in 2018, it's impressive to see volumes in North America increase 1% off a 9% growth rate that was experienced in 2017. ","We also delivered volume growth of 6% in Latin America, 4% in Asia-Pacific and 2% in EMEA. We continue to benefit from increased global penetration of our case-ready platform in all proteins and incremental sales in the fluids market where we are replacing rigid containers with sustainable flexible materials. Throughout Europe and most recently North America and Asia, we are experiencing increased demand for our Darfresh eco portfolio which is designed to a provide sustainable solution for all proteins including seafood. This offering complements continued growth in our sustainable trays and lids that offer extended shelf life and higher consumer appeal. ","We expect this trend to continue well into the future. Our successful penetration into the fluids market is directly related to our innovative and vertical pouch packaging platforms, which includes our FlexPrep solutions that integrates equipment, materials and dispensing technologies. We are confident Food Care will continue to deliver above market growth rates on the top line while driving strong operating leverage.","On slide 12, we highlight results from our Product Care division. In the fourth quarter, Product Care net sales of $489 million increased 7% in constant dollars. Excluding acquisitions, Product Care sales were up 1% on stable volumes and favorable price mix. We were pleased to see that North America volumes were up 3% driven by strong growth in our inflatable bubble wrap platform, paper offerings and automated system. While volumes were up in North America, the UK and China declined primarily due to macroeconomic factors. The UK is managing through an uncertain economic environment and China is facing challenges from Trade Wars as well as decelerated production rates.","Adjusted EBITDA of $85 million or 17.5% of sales increased 6% in constant dollars compared to last year due to restructuring savings as well as contributions from the AFP acquisition. For the full-year in constant dollars, Product Care delivered 8% adjusted EBITDA growth on 10% sales growth. As mentioned, our top line growth was driven by acquisitions as well as favorable price mix. Margins were essentially in line with last year at 17.5%. The business benefited from favorable mix and price cost spread, restructuring savings as well as contributions from acquisitions. ","In e-commerce fulfillment, we continue to see increased demand for our Inflatable Bubble Wrap, paper, Korrvu and automated solutions, all of which are designed to minimize waste, reduce damage as well as help our customers meet their sustainability goals. We are accelerating our investment to reinvent our mailer, void fill and box elimination solutions that are 100% recyclable and automated. We are working with our B2B customers to modify their packaging to meet new industry expectations that their products are parcel ready. This trend will accelerate growth in our specialty industrial applications portfolio, which includes our integrated fabrication, specialty foam as well as Instapak offerings. We see opportunities to expand Product Care margins by optimizing our go-to-market strategy and simplifying our business to better align with our changing end market dynamics. ","Let's now turn to our free cash flow for 2018 on slide 13. We generated $311 million in free cash flow in 2018, which was indeed below our most recent forecast of $350 million. As many of you know, our seasonality in working capital is heavily weighted toward our year-end. In the last few weeks of the year, our performance in working capital did fall short of our expectations, particularly in accounts payable and while inventory levels did decline from the third to the fourth quarter of 2018, that decline was not enough to offset our results in accounts payable. Capital expenditures were $169 million or 3.5% of net sales. Interest payments, net of interest income was $176 million. Cash tax payments were $155 million. Restructuring payments dedicated to our core operations were $12 million.","At this time, I will turn the call back over to Ted to discuss our outlook for 2019.","Ted Doheny","Thank you, Bill. Turning to our total company 2019 outlook. Net sales are expected to be approximately $4.8 billion or 2% growth as reported. Unfavorable currency is expected to negatively impact sales by $130 million. On a constant dollar basis, net sales are expected to increase 5% with Food Care up 4% and Product Care up 5.5%. Excluding the AFP acquisition, net sales on an organic basis are expected to be up 3% with 1% growth in Product Care. Adjusted EBITDA for the full-year is expected to be approximately $925 million to $945 million, an increase of approximately 4% to 6%. ","Our operating leverage is expected to reach our 40% target in 2019. Currency is estimated to have unfavorable impact on EBITDA of $25 million. We estimate $70 million in restructuring savings, which will help offset currency and inflationary headwinds. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, an increase of approximately 6% to 10% compared to the prior year. This forecast assumes no additional shares repurchases in 2019. For the full-year, our outlook for free cash flow is approximately $250 million, net of $115 million in restructuring payments and $200 million in CapEx. ","As part of Reinvent SEE planning, we identified and prioritized high return investments that align with our growth strategy and productivity initiatives. Cash tax payments are estimated to be $130 million and interest payments, net of interest income is expected to be $190 million. Once our restructuring efforts are behind us, we expect our EBITDA to free cash flow conversion to increase over 40% with CapEx of approximately 4% of net sales and an improvement in working capital velocity.","On slide 15, we provide more detail on our restructuring programs. Our existing program is focused on completing our efforts to eliminate stranded costs. This is on track to be largely completed in the first half of 2019. Our new program announced as part of our Reinvent SEE strategy is already under way and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. In 2019, as I previously mentioned, we expect savings from our existing and new program to be approximately $70 million. Cash restructuring payments are anticipated to be $115 million. In 2020 and 2021, we anticipate additional savings of approximately $100 million and cash restructuring benefits to be in the range of $110 million to $140 million. These payments will be incurred primarily in 2020.","As we begin a new year and executed our Reinvent SEE strategy, you'll see us reach new levels of performance continuing on our journey to world-class. We are expecting to double our operating leverage or our profit to growth ratio again to 40% and accelerate CapEx investments to improve manufacturing efficiencies and unleash long-term growth opportunities. With Reinvent SEE, we are confident Sealed Air will achieve organic growth above the markets we serve, drive margin expansion and produce industry-leading returns for shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress to reinvent SEE throughout the year.","With that, I'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Gaffner from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Gaffner","Thanks. Good morning Bill, Ted, Lori. Ted, I just wanted to talk about some of the SG&A productivity initiatives that you've put in place, just trying to frame the productivity initiatives relative to some of your peers. I'm sure you've done some benchmarking in regards to that. Is there anything, whether it's R&D or the way the company was sort of a separate, the entities were, the segments were headquartered at different locations before that sort of kept the Company historically from achieving SG&A productivity in line with peers. And also as part of that, can you talk about the opportunity in Food Care versus Product Care side? Thanks.","Ted Doheny","Sure, I'll try to frame it up Scott. If you look at historically where we were, it's three divisions, now it's two divisions. Part of that was the focus of looking at each one individually versus where we think we have more opportunities if we look collectively as one. So part of the one Sealed Air approach that we announced and having one Sealed Air commercial organization, we think that's going to allow us to simplify some of the redundancies that we have out there as we go to market, definitely being more focused on the markets we serve, having less divisional, functional, regional overlaps. ","So we think we have some opportunity. To your question about comparing it and benchmarking, yes, we looked at that, we looked at where our SG&A ratios were compared to our peers. In the comparatives, we keep using the theme of world-class, where do we think it should be. We also went back and looked historically and we were tough on ourselves and we said over the last five years, pull Diversey away and we saw that there was, the sales had been fairly flat and we added 100 basis points of SG&A. So we had a lot of data there to say, we know we can be more efficient and so let's look at it as one and see what we can do to be more effective. ","Also there's new tools today. You know, we've been working on some digital systems on the back office to see how we can be more effective, how we work with each other, but also work and access the channel market. So we think we have some significant opportunity there. I am excited to have Karl there to help bring this together, to bring the sales teams around the world to act as one. And we also are seeing our customers coming together as one. We're seeing the push on e-groceries with our customers. In five to eight years, the grocery store that we all shop in is to be extremely different. ","We're going to be putting food and dry goods in the same packaging and so we're seeing that example around the world. So, our customers can see the value of us acting as one. So it's going to show up in the SG&A. On the innovation side, it's pretty interesting as well. We package materials, whether to put a Turkey into a bag or a technological product into a Bubble Wrap pouch and how do we do that efficiently, what materials, do we use plastic, paper, foam et cetera. So we see our innovations coming together, how do we automate that process and I'll give you an example that relates to our plastics pledge. ","We could pretty quickly take the waste that we're getting from our Food Care and that be the feedstock for Product Care and if we can crack that code and take that scrap and turn it into a recyclable product, which I think we can conquer, it's pretty good synergy. That's just one example of working together as one company. I think we have some significant opportunities ahead of us.","Bill Stiehl","So as you noticed, on the SG&A, a lot of our activities in 2017 and '18 Scott were focused on getting our stranded costs reduced because of the Diversey Care separation and we focused a lot on our corporate overhead to get down to be a smaller company. Now we're looking at the functional support necessary in the SG&A area to support the consolidation of Food Care and Product Care and we're looking at things like spans and layers, number of direct reports and we're already putting those actions in place in January.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Please go ahead.","Ghansham Panjabi","I guess, first off, just kind of going back to the fourth quarter. On the 3Q earnings report, you basically rebased guidance for 4Q. So I guess, first off, what surprised you to the upside relative to your initial guidance specific to the fourth quarter? And then second, related to that, how will the restructuring savings flow through by segment during 2019? Anything you can share in terms of the cadence of the savings on a quarterly basis would be really helpful. Thanks.","Bill Stiehl","Yes, so, thanks very much for the question and as you know, we came up with a profit warning as a result of our expectation of third quarter results and we were happy to be able to exceed that and I will say that, congratulations to Ted and the management team for looking at the results, looking at our current forecast and taking the actions necessary to drive cost reductions in the business in order to achieve the fourth quarter results that we were able to get, to get to the $890 million.","And we were actually able to quickly put in place a lot of the actions on Reinvent SEE and we saw some lift in the P&L because some of those actions reflected in our results for Q4 of 2018. Going forward, we will continue with respect to reportable segments, keep Product Care and Food Care separate. We have no immediate plans to change that either in our 10-K for 2018 that will be filed in two weeks or in our quarterly financials that will be issued in 2019 and we would anticipate speaking about the operating results of both Food Care and Product Care to external parties much in the way that we've done in the past.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for the details. I had two questions, guys. First of all, congratulations to Karl on his additional role. What are the learnings so far that you're finding from combining all the commercial activities under Karl and how do you apply them to combining R&D and what's the, if you will, the synergy or leverage between the two? And then on sustainability, Ted, you talked about all of the opportunity and initiatives that you have under way of your most important products and I realize that's a little bit subjective, which of your products you think would be most able to be made more sustainable toward your goals and which might be more challenging? You know, I'm thinking about Instapak, maybe that is a little bit more difficult to get under the sustainability umbrella. Thank you.","Ted Doheny","Okay. George, you're always pretty good with two questions. I think there is multiple, but I'll try to break it to two.","George Staphos","Thank you.","Ted Doheny","First, and we'll begin with Karl, excited about Karl and his job to help accelerate that. On the, it's tied back into the SG&A, but the learnings were is we go to market in different countries is probably the biggest one. When we were set up by divisions, we went into these countries with a full force of a company, we went in with all our finance, we went in all the different functions and we built the functional structure for the country before what was the business opportunity and how we're going to go best get that. And our analysis of the country analysis and looking as one company, where is the business, where are the resources, how do we take care of customers, how do we get our service capability, how do we get the lowest most, not the lowest, most efficient cost and so that learning has been good and we've got more to do on that.","On the R&D side, it is really looking at the process of what we do, as I mentioned before. We package things and where the industry is going is automation. So how do we have our packaging that can answer some of those automated questions for our customers and how do we look at that together with one lens going across the divisions. It ties into the third point where you said about the most challenging. Let me talk about the opportunity again is if we look at the film that we put in what are ubiquitous Bubble Wrap, why can't we make that fully recycled. We challenged our research team, we said, look, we want to get to that fully recycled by 2025. So we turned the equation up, and we said, how do you get there now? What do we need to do to get a fully recycled material going into Bubble Wrap?","We think we have the technical solution now, we have a proprietary solution. Now, we got to go make that happen and we are surely going to do that faster than 2025, but that was a cross-functional research team getting that action done. So the process internally is we look at the opportunities with one lens versus a part goes to Product Care, a part goes to Food Care, a part goes to Diversey in the past and I think it's going to add better acceleration to taking care of the biggest opportunities the fastest. To your comment about Instapak, where, that's part of our, it's a tremendous solution for us and so that's in the sustainability. So our research folks are going to have to figure that one out. Don't have that answer yet, but we're going to go after that.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde","Yes, good morning, Ted.","Ted Doheny","Hi, Mark.","Mark Wilde","Ted, I wondered if you could just put a little more color on some of the shifts that you're making in terms of the channels to market?","Ted Doheny","Well, how about if we talk about first looking at our channels to market. We go to market direct and through our distributor base. One of the kind, actually we're introducing and talking more about, we want to have an e-commerce portal to the market. So let's say, if we use those three ways to market. Part of our, it's been tremendous for me being in the business now for a year is having that direct access to our customers so we can truly solve their problems, know what they need, know how we can help. So that direct access is very important.","When we go the distributors, it's still important to use that efficiency, but where we're working on is how can we drive a stronger loyalty base with our distribution network. So the teams have been working at, looking at our distributors, looking where we are most effective and adding value to our distributors, where they are loyal to us, and loyal means exclusivity. So we put a program in place, a loyalty program for our distributors and rewarded that loyalty with the full access and power of Sealed Air. So that's in process. We think we'll see even more of that going into 2019.","So on the direct side, it's thinking about how can we be more effective and efficient for our customers. Now what's interesting, we go to market and we cover both the end-user which could be a food processor. So we're in there with the packaging, how do the major meat producers package in our large bag, but then we're also connected to the retail market to make sure we understand where, how is that package then repackaged at the store, what the presentation of the package looks like. ","So how do we do that effectively and efficiently to give, serving both of those customer segments as effective as possible. And also doing that simply around the world, I think we sometimes duplicate effort across regions as I mentioned before. So I think we have some opportunity for efficiency, probably too long of an answer that we can follow-up on later.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead.","Q - Anthony Pettinari","Hi, good morning. Ted, in your opening remarks, you talked about pursuing value capture pricing and I was wondering if you could provide any detail in terms of categories or end-markets that might be right for that. I think this is something Sealed Air has talked about in the past, how would you compare what's already been done versus the opportunity in front of you?","Ted Doheny","Well, the first is I used the term value capture because I don't like calling it pricing because our customers are always listening and our customers will pay us for value and we can get great price. We got to have the right cost and, but if we can take care of solving their problems, we will get paid. So I don't like to use to put the price in your face, so that's why I called value. So, it's our burden to go save their money. I'll give you a tactical example that we just put in place. We're rewarding the top two sales professionals that have saved our customers the most money.","So, we are showing them that how much money can you save a customer, we're going to recognize you as the best of the best and that's what I mean. So, it's going to be forcing us to continue to look at how we save their money. Well, behind the scenes, there are some tactical stuff and by the way, the theme is, this is a good business, we're going to go take it to world-class. Well, let's look at our pricing schemes by what are the real margins of the products and that's the detailed analysis we've gone through. We found that we had some SKUs that we were selling at the wrong price. ","We had some SKUs that where we could have done it differently with either higher or lower. So it's putting more of an automated discipline to that and putting some tools in place in front of our deal desk so they have that information. One tactical example we've just put in place, we found if a customer isn't calling us back, why? And we found that if we call the customer back within 30 days just to check in and we did have a problem, we can recover that customer. If we don't call that customer back, the data that we benchmark against, if you wait six months, you've got a lost customer. So two tactical examples.","Bill Stiehl","Part of this also, we're looking at optimizing our sales and incentive structures for our sales people, looking at that price leakage, trying to eliminate some of the lower margin SKUs as Ted has indicated. Another piece of this price leakage analysis is establishing firmer customer discount guidelines and not granting exceptions to those pre-established guidelines.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good morning, guys.","Ted Doheny","Good morning.","Brian Maguire","Two questions from me, one, on the restructuring savings. Obviously, they are significant any way you slice them as a percentage of revenue or percentage of EBIT. Just wondering if you could provide some more details around the buckets. You know maybe, I know it's a sensitive topic but maybe around headcount reductions, what you're expecting there? Or plant rationalizations or just any more concrete metrics that we could be expecting to kind of figure out whether those cost savings are reasonable or not?","And then, sort of the second question which is related is, the last couple of years, most of the restructuring benefits have been offset by OpEx inflation and I think that's been running around $50 million a year of inflation on average, some years a little bit more, some years a little bit less but if you pull out the acquisition contributions in there, it seems like that's been around the right number. As you think about it going forward, is that about the right number we should be thinking of, such that over the three-year life of this program you've maybe got $150 million of OpEx to offset the $250 million roughly of restructuring savings?","Ted Doheny","Okay, well, how about we'll tag team that. This is Ted, I'll go first and we'll go back and forth with Bill. Some of the tangible things on the restructuring, we do have some facilities that we are in the process of closing and that will be there. We did have a voluntary separation program that we initiated in the fourth quarter, it's roughly 200 people. So tactically, we have buckets we, when we look at our restructuring, we actually have the four buckets that I described to you. We actually have nine internal work streams that we're working. I don't know, Bill if you want to go through?","Bill Stiehl","Yes, so as we look through this, there's several work streams. We've got the I&D productivity, the buy piece which looks at direct materials, indirect materials to make, we looked at yield improvement, operating productivity and the SG&A as we mentioned, and then the pricing and the channel efficiencies. On some of the reorganization that we've already looked at, we announced that we closed a facility in Chile and we're rolling that into our operations in both Brazil and Argentina. We announced a closure of our Norway Product Care plant merging that into Sweden and we're looking at Product Care plants in Texas as well.","The first phase of headcount reduction as Ted indicates was the voluntary separation plan and the P&L does reflect some savings relative to that and we've not announced at this point any additional headcount reductions by way of involuntary. There was an earlier question about the split of the restructuring savings that we had in 2019 and we're identifying estimated restructuring savings of $70 million and that's going to be split about 60% Food Care and 40% Product Care. And again, those savings actions are going to be really spread over all parts of the P&L.","There is looks at pricing, SKUs, procurement, operations, not just traditional restructuring plans that hit G&A and we're tracking the savings very, very closely that will give us higher confidence in our quarterly forecasting process and we're managing any possible reinvestment with a vengeance and we're looking at salary inflation at around $35 million per year and we anticipate that those restructuring savings will go a long way to offset those headwinds.","Lori Chaitman","Operator.","Ted Doheny","Yes, Lori, just can I have just one follow-up to that with Bill and going forward, we'll be communicating in the seven work streams that Bill described, we're going to be adding two more work streams. And then also just to give you the vision of what our operational excellence means post this restructuring is develop this productivity engine that, that salary inflation is covered. So that we have a productivity in place that can handle that $35 million to $40 million year-over-year and that's what the goal of the Reinvent SEE is about.","Lori Chaitman","And I'll just add real quick that I&D that Bill mentioned is, Innovation and Development. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez from UBS. Please go ahead.","Edlain Rodriguez","Thank you. Ted, congratulations. In terms of, it's been like almost 45 minutes and no questions on resin costs which is good. So quick one for you on the cost savings, especially, like in terms of the operating ratio, again 40% you have achieved that pretty quickly. Can this ratio improve as we get into 2020, 2021 as the cost savings accelerate?","Ted Doheny","Yes, first of all, thank you for the resin comment. So we're moving from being considered a chemical company or a converter of resin, but yes, the 40% we have out there is a target. As you'll do the math and you'll see is what we're driving these savings to come through and Bill and I are holding this restructuring bucket really tight. So you will see that come through, but you'll also see the savings come through. So, we'll be 40% plus as we go through this program. So definitely you'll see that. But we will have as we go through it, this inflationary period that we talked about previously, this $35 million that will overnight, we're not to make that go away but that's part of the process.","So with all those through the 40% plus, that what we'll been working on, but I do want to highlight again, we put the discipline guard rails into the business. We have the PG ratio, you see we hold it out, we stay committed to that, but we also have the ROIC behind the scenes and we've had that as a shadow metric that we've been running hard. That is going to keep our eyes on the prize and so, we're watching that very carefully with our CapEx. One of the reasons why we've increased the CapEx, we've seen some ROIC opportunities that will drive some significant improvement in our operating performance, specifically in the automation area of our facilities. So I believe the discipline will keep us on path to make sure that we're delivering the value that we're promising.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Rizzo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Rizzo","Good morning. You're mentioning, we talked a lot about innovation and how the focus, would that suggest that you are going to be using a vitality index? And if you are, is there a goal in mind for that?","Ted Doheny","Yes, we've had the vitality index for a while. The definition of the vitality index is that new products that show up in our sales that have been developed in the last five years and so it's rolling off after five years. So what, the modification to the vitality index is we're also including our M&A. If we can buy the innovation and that's the pressure we're putting on the team. We set up some collaboration with some major technical university so we can have access to what's going on with some incubating technology we can take a look at. So the vitality index would get credit for that.","So where has it been? It's been in that 10% to 11%, and so we declared as a team to grow this engine, we want to double that to take that from 10%, 11% to 20% in the next five years and that's what we're focusing on, but part of the assessment on our Reinvent SEE is we reinvent the development again looking at it as one company, but what projects that are out there that aren't moving. We do have a long-term lens, we are focused on sustainability, but we also have to put pressure in velocity on the development. So if it is not moving those projects will be replaced by something that has, that we can see in the next five years that's going to drive our bottom line.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Neel Kumar from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Neel Kumar","Hi, good morning. Of the 1% organic growth in Product Care that expect for 2019, can you talk about what type of growth you expect in your utility portfolio versus your, more automated solutions?","Bill Stiehl","We're expecting the Product Care volume growth for 2019 to be relatively flat compared to '18. We'll see some pricing that we'll able to go after because of increases in freight and labor cost. And Ted already talked about some of our channel optimization and the opportunities that we have to incorporate value captured, value creation pricing in our of both Oroduct Care and our Food Care business. But again, we're looking at very, very flat volume in Product Care year-over-year.","Neel Kumar","Thanks.","Lori Chaitman","Operator go ahead, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Salvator Tiano","Hi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. How are you?","Ted Doheny","Good.","Salvator Tiano","Great. So, my first question is on capital allocation for 2019. If I understand correctly, you didn't do any buybacks and in 4Q and if you can confirm whether that was related to the restructuring initiatives that were announced. And also as we look into last year, do you think that the pace of buybacks will slow significantly because of all the elevated restructuring costs? Or could we still see significant buybacks inside of deleveraging?","Bill Stiehl","Yes. So, we don't actually guide to the level of share buybacks that we plan on the next year. We've taken an opportunistic approach to our buybacks in the past, we would anticipate continuing to do that. But I don't think a discussion of share buybacks is complete by looking at, without looking at the entire capital allocation factors as it relates to both M&A, our internal CapEx, the payments of dividends et cetera. So again, we wouldn't anticipate any particular guidance modifications relative to share buybacks compared to what we've done in the past at this point in the year.","Salvator Tiano","Okay, perfect. And one last thing little bit on working capital, what kind of assumptions are you making in the free cash flow guidance. And versus that $250 million, is there something, resins were brought up but the question been actually happened, so what kind of upside could we see from you the resin prices going down recently?","Bill Stiehl","Yes. So resins is, obviously an issue that we talk about a lot, it's very, very difficult to predict. I'll give you an example. We saw a [indiscernible] drop in resins in October of 2018, again in December of 2018, but then we've already heard and we've been told about announced price increases in the first quarter of 2019. So we really are using from a guidance perspective for 2019, a very, very flat approach. We expect the resin prices to stay flat throughout 2019. Relative to free cash and how we came up with that $250 million, the increase as you will see. Ted and I are very excited along with Emile Chammas, our Senior VP of Supply Chain to increase our capital expenditures in 2019 from a $159 million at '18 to $200 million in '19 as we focus on solving customer's problems and creating value and implementing our Reinvent SEE initiatives.","Ted Doheny","Okay, just, I want make sure Bill. I don't want to scare people we're excited to spend CapEx, maybe we put it to work. So we have had [indiscernible] with my finance team that, if we notice some working capital, we put to work velocity there. And that's what it's about the velocity. And the velocity is one that we did highlight that we think we have an opportunity on is inventory. And it's velocity because we think we could actually improve our on-time delivery and reduce our inventory. Inventory has been flat days on hand for the last three years.","I think we have an opportunity as we reinvent our processes, our four piece that I talked about. As we go to automation and improve our process efficiency, improve our cycle time, I think on the working capital, we have an opportunity there and you'll see that in the working capital as we go to a higher level of automation, another cash generation for the business, cash generator business.","Bill Stiehl","On the inventory, inventory did actually go down from the third quarter of '18 till fourth quarter of '18. They did go up slightly year-over-year as we look at our AFP acquisition and also looked at improving our on-time delivery statistics in the first half of 2018. We anticipate inventory to be a source of working capital in 2019.","Ted Doheny","I think we're not happy with that. We want to do better.","Lori Chaitman","Yes. Operator, I think we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","Okay. Our last question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Arun Viswanathan","Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a quick question on Food Care, maybe can you just your outlook on the beef cycle and I guess how transpires in North America for the next year and then if you could touch on Brazil and Australia, New Zealand trends as well? Thanks.","Bill Stiehl","So with respect to Food Care, in the beef cycle, I mean, the futures indicate that the herd expansion that we've experienced in the past is beginning to decelerate but it'll still be positive throughout 2021. And our Food Care as we look at our 2018 outlook, our sales guidance is having a 4% increase in our Food Care sales and that's primarily coming out from volume. We have seen some strong results in several of the countries that are the major beef producers, but US and Brazil are leading that. We have seen some decreases in Australia.","Lori Chaitman","The export market has remained strong and we expect to strong in Australia. It's interesting what's there in Australia. They did have some weather issues, the pasture conditions were poor and it did end up pushing them to slaughter far some their herds. So they will be in rebuilding heard mode as we head into '19 and that's kind of what we're expecting out of Australia. But we do think that in the rest of the world beef production is going to be up and we'll benefit from that and then we continued penetration of our core products in some of our newer markets.","So again, we are seeing in Asia some opportunity where a lot of unpacked meat is moving to packed meat, so we're benefiting from that and again, we continue to see some opportunity in our case ready platform, our sustainability films are during really nicely in the UK particularly and throughout Europe and that has been moving into North America and also in part Asia. So we're very pleased with that. ","Ted, do you have any closing remarks?","Ted Doheny","No, I want to thank everyone for their time and stay tuned as we reinvent Sealed Air. Thank you.","Lori Chaitman","Thanks to everybody. Operator?","Operator","Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for attending today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Good day."],"19231":["Sealed Air Corp. (NYSE:SEE) Q2 2018 Earnings Call August  2, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Edward L.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","It's now my pleasure to turn the program over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. The floor is yours.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future periods are forward-looking statements.

We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release and slide presentation, which applies to this call.","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors.

Ted?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Lori, and thank all of you for your interest in Sealed Air. Welcome to our 2018 second quarter conference call. I'll begin the call with a few brief comments on our financial results and highlight recent investments both internal and external that will drive high quality growth. Bill will then provide a more detailed review of our financials. I'll close with our 2018 outlook, key drivers for the second half of the year, and where we're making progress on longer-term growth opportunities and operational efficiencies.","So let me get started with a recap of our performance in Q2. We delivered solid results for the second consecutive quarter. Net sales increased 8% to $1.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA increased 11% to $218 million. EBITDA margin of 18.8% improved 50 basis points compared to last year and operating leverage or profit-to-growth ratio of 25%.","Our performance was attributable to strong top line growth, cost reductions, and pricing actions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.64, which is almost double what we delivered in the same period last year. This year-over-year increase was attributable to profitable growth, accretion from a share repurchases, and a more favorable tax rate. Year-to-date, we repurchased $530 million or 20 million shares. We have approximately $900 million remaining under our current authorization.","We expect to deliver on our full year 2018 objectives despite unfavorable currency weighing on our second half forecast. Our outlook for sales implies a 7% increase in constant dollars as compared to our previous forecast of 4.5%. This revised outlook assumes higher growth in our core business in five months of operations were approximately $50 million in sales from the AFP acquisition announced this morning.","We continue to benefit from strong fresh food and e-commerce markets and we're seeing increased demand for our essential and high-performing packaging solutions that extend shelf life, reduce waste, and drive customer productivity.","We're also executing on our targeted acquisition strategy. Constant dollar sales growth combined with additional cost reduction actions and ongoing productivity improvements will deliver operating leverage above our 20% target for the year. We expect reported adjusted EBITDA to be in line with our previously provided guidance even with FX headwinds.","Before we provide more detail on our results and outlook, I want to spend a few minutes on our AFP acquisition and the Kuraray plant-based resin agreement announced in June. AFP, a privately-held U.S.-based company, is a leading provider of specialized custom engineered packaging. AFP generated $125 million in sales in 2017, has 260 employees and operate six facilities across the U.S. with further presence in Asia and Mexico.","We see growth synergies with both the AFP acquisition and our recent Fagerdala acquisition that expands our fabricated design capabilities for the electronics, transportation, and industrial markets. AFP and Fagerdala align well with the Ship In Own Container, in SIOC trend in e-commerce. This trend is transforming e-commerce packaging as more distributors want manufacturers to have their primary packaging parcel ready.","Just last week, in support of Amazon's SIOC initiative, we announced our participation in the Amazon Packaging Support and Supplier Network, which certifies Sealed Air to test, design and supply packaging across the globe without additional testing or documentation from Amazon. AFP and Fagerdala also give us an expanded platform to broaden the application of our award-winning sustainable EcoPure solution. EcoPure is made from plant-based resin that we can now incorporate into a fully fabricated solution.","Our announcement of Kuraray, a Japanese material company, enables us to offer food packaging materials derived from its plant-based resins. This agreement expands our portfolio of sustainable solutions, enabling us to offer renewable packaging option as a higher barrier protection and as cost competitive with traditional rollstock films. We will invest in our own development and production capacity utilizing Kuraray's plant-based resin to broaden materials application across our end markets. We will continue to lead in sustainable solutions and packaging that include renewable, recyclable, reusable and recoverable applications.","Let me now pass the call to Bill to provide more details on our second quarter results. Bill?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Ted. Turning to slide 4, let's start with the review of our net sales by region. In the second quarter, net sales of $1.2 billion, increased 7% on a constant dollar basis with growth across all regions. In North America, sales increased 4% with Product Care up 6% and Food Care up 2%. Europe, Middle East, and Africa, or EMEA, increased 4% in the quarter. Our largest and fastest growing countries in EMEA were the UK, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Russia. Asia Pacific increased 22% as reported and 20% in constant dollars.","Excluding sales from Fagerdala, Asia Pacific was up 5%, primarily due to higher slaughter rates in Australia, increased demand for packaging proteins in emerging markets, and strength in e-commerce. Latin America was up 7% as reported and 19% in constant dollars. Volume in Latin America was up 12%, which was attributable to increased demand in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, where we benefited from new customer wins.","On slide 5, we present our first half performance. Sales were up 9% on an as-reported basis and 7% in constant dollars with positive trends across all regions.","Slide 6 highlights volume and price mix trends by division and by region. On a global basis, we delivered favorable price mix of 4%. Price mix was favorable in Food Care and in Product Care due to previously announced price increases, formula pass-throughs and continued shift to value-added solutions, all of which more than offset higher input and freight costs. We were able to get positive price realization in Latin America to offset the currency devaluation.","Volume, excluding the Fagerdala acquisition, was up 1% globally. Food Care volumes were up 2% with positive trends in all regions except North America. Volume was up 12% in Latin America, 6% in Asia Pacific and 1% in EMEA, reflecting new customer wins and favorable market conditions. Volume in North America were down 1%, as growth in materials was more than offset by a decline in equipment sales due to the timing of installations and strong prior year results.","First half orders are up compared to last year, as our customers invest in replacement equipment and capacity for new applications. As a result, we do expect growth to return in the second half of 2018.","Product Care volumes, excluding the impact of Fagerdala, were up slightly in the quarter. EMEA was up 4% and APAC was up 3%, which was offset by a 2% decline in North America. In North America, increased demand for our differentiated portfolio across the e-commerce and industrial markets was offset by declines in our utility products, including traditional Bubble Wrap and shrink film.","On slide 7, we present our sales and EBITDA bridges for the second quarter. I covered sales trends in the last two slides, so my comments now will focus on EBITDA performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% in constant dollars to $218 million, or 18.8% of net sales. Growth in adjusted EBITDA was attributable to volumes of $5 million, favorable mix and price\/cost spread of $20 million, and restructuring savings of $10 million. This was partially offset by $15 million in higher operating costs related to salary and wage inflation and investments across our global operations to support existing and future growth. Currency was favorable, $2 million. Adjusted EPS was $0.64, on average diluted shares outstanding of 161 million.","Our adjusted tax rate was 23% in the second quarter related to discrete items and earnings mix. We are now revising our estimated adjusted tax rate for the full year 2018 down to 28% from 29% before to reflect the lower rate in the second quarter of 2018. We continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize our tax posture.","Slide 8 displays our first half sales and EBITDA bridges. If we focus on EBITDA for the first half, you will see that higher volumes, favorable mix, and price\/cost spread and restructuring savings offset higher operating costs. Currency had a favorable impact of $8 million.","Turning to our results by division, on slide 9, we present Q2 and first half results for Food Care. In the second quarter, Food Care net sales increased 5% in constant dollars to $713 million due to favorable price\/mix and positive volume trends. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3% in constant dollars to $135 million or 19% of net sales.","Favorable mix and price\/cost spread turned positive in the quarter due to timing of contract pass-throughs and global pricing actions on non-formula customers. We do expect this trend to continue for the remainder of the year. The increase in operating costs was primarily related to salary and wage inflation and operational investments to support growth. This was partially offset by $7 million in restructuring savings.","While we are pleased that Food Care navigated well through unforeseen macro events, including the trucking strike in Brazil as well as currency devaluations, we would like to have seen more operating leverage come through on the 5% sales growth. We made investments throughout the organization to meet increased demands for our core products, particularly our case-ready platform.","We also invested in capacities to support our robust pipeline for new innovations, including our FlexPrep solution for the fluids market. These operational investments will improve our manufacturing efficiencies and will contribute to improve leverage in future quarters.","On slide 10, we highlight results from our Product Care division. In the second quarter, Product Care net sales increased 11% in constant dollars to $442 million. Excluding Fagerdala, Product Care sales were up 5%.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% in constant dollars to $79 million or 17.8% of net sales. This performance was driven by favorable mix and price\/cost spread, as well as restructuring savings. Our pricing actions are taking hold, and we are seeing a more profitable mix of business, particularly in the e-commerce and fulfillment segment. The increase in operating cost was primarily related to salary and wage inflation, offset by income from the Fagerdala acquisition.","Let's now turn to our free cash flow for the six months, which is on slide 11. Free cash flow for the six months ended June was a use of cash of $5 million, which included $42 million of a one-time payment we made in January of 2018 to an outside engineering firm in lieu of certain future royalties. CapEx spend was $74 million. Interest payments, net of interest income, were $86 million and cash tax payments were $97 million, including a $20 million transition tax payment related to the United States tax reform.","For the full year, we continue to expect CapEx to be $160 million. Interest payments, net of interest income, to be $175 million and cash tax payments to be $145 million. Cash restructuring, excluding payments related to stranded costs, is on track to be approximately $20 million.","Let me now turn the call back to Ted to review our 2018 outlook. Ted?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Bill. Turning to our total company 2018 outlook on slide 12, net sales are expected to be approximately $4.7 billion, an increase of 6.5% on an as-reported basis. We now forecast currency to have a negative impact on net sales of $20 million. This updated forecast assumes currency headwinds primarily on Food Care results due to exposure to Europe, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand.","For Food Care, we expect full year constant dollar sales to increase approximately 4%. This is 100 basis points higher than our previous forecast. We continue to see accelerated adoption of our innovations across the globe, including case-ready and OptiDure high-abuse bags. We have a healthy pipeline of equipment orders for customers that are upgrading aged assets and investing in capacity for new applications.","The cattle market in Latin America has rebounded and we gained share. In Australia, we benefited from a spike in slaughter rates due to dry weather conditions. While we do not expect this level of production to continue, the cattle cycle is bottoming and we expect modest growth into year-end.","For Product Care, we now expect full year constant dollar sales to increase 11%, which includes approximately $120 million of incremental sales from Fagerdala and AFP. Excluding these acquisitions, our outlook implies an increased sales of approximately 4%. We expect strong growth to continue for our new innovation across our Product Care portfolio. This will drive higher quality growth as our customers recognize the savings we bring to their operations.","Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA remains the same at $890 million to $910 million, implying a margin of 19%. This outlook now assumes unfavorable currency of negative $5 million as compared to our previous outlook, which was in positive currency of $20 million. Improved operating leverage in the back half of the year is expected to offset currency headwinds. We are reiterating our adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow outlook.","EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.55. Higher D&A and net interest expense offsets our lower estimated tax rate. We do not assume additional share repurchases in our guidance. For free cash flow, we are on track to deliver approximately $400 million.","As we look beyond 2018 into 2019 and 2020, we're focusing on opportunities that will drive margin expansion and higher returns. We're finding more productivity opportunities, where we can do more with less by investing and working smarter. Over the last three years, on average, approximately 70% of our capital has been spent maintaining our network, restructuring activity, and investing in a new corporate campus.","We're shifting our capital to growth in productivity driven by ROIC. We're investing in process improvements in our existing network as well as new capacity and high-growth regions to be closer to our customers. To create profitable growth, we are accelerating the adoption of our innovative solutions in high-value growth markets.","We're continuously investing and commercializing new solutions and leveraging our powerful brands around the world. We have and we'll continue to complement core growth with accretive M&A. We're targeting acquisitions that are not only core to our existing business but that expand our presence in high-growth geographies and accelerate our entrance into adjacent markets.","We are using ROIC as a guide to our investments, how we allocate our capital, and increase free cash flow. Our focus is on opportunities that will drive earnings accretion and long-term value for our customers, shareholders, and employees.","Now, let me pass the call to Lori to open us up for questions. Lori?","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, Ted. Please mark your calendars the Thursday, November 1 for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. Operator, we'd like to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'd like to take any questions you may have. In the interest of time, we ask that you please ask no more than one question and any additional questions to please re-queue to allow as many questioners as time permits.","And it looks like our first question in queue will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. You talked about the sales contribution from AFP. Apologies if I missed this, but could you talk about EBITDA contribution or maybe just the EBITDA margin profile in that business as well as purchase price, any color you can give there?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","We don't share the EBITDA or the purchase price. We did share that it's roughly $125 million in sales and it will be accretive, but we're not actually sharing for competitive reasons the profitability. It's a similar business to what we did purchase in Fagerdala. The margins are less than our core, but we are excited about the synergies, especially the growth synergies between this and Fagerdala to the business.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Anthony, do you have another question? Operator, let's move to next question, and Anthony will come back...","Operator","Okay. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Good morning.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Ted, I just had a quick question on Product Care. If I look at it, the volumes were a little light of our expectation in the quarter. And there's been some consolidation within the market in the quarter, I think Pregis bought the FP International and there was another, I think, Polyair got acquired in the quarter. Are you seeing anything around the competitive landscape in Product Care that gives you any caution around the go-forward view there?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Always cautioned, we're definitely aware of the FP acquisition. We were actually looking that ourselves. In our Product Care business, though, we're actually seeing strong, actually double-digit growth in our inflatable Bubble Wrap, our Korrvu, and some of the automations and even our mailer business. What we did not see on the growth is we do have some cannibalization of our legacy Bubble Wrap and shrink, but also that it's conscious (23:57) that it's very price sensitive into the market.","So, actually excited about some of the things we're working on in Product Care and with some of our newest sustainable solutions for growth going forward. So, not a concern on the growth going forward but the volume will be slightly up. Most of our growth in the second quarter is going to be on that price mix.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thanks, Ted. Operator, next question?","Operator","Absolutely. Our next question will come from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess, stepping back a little bit and first up, Bill, congrats on your permanent role as well. But did volumes come in where you thought they would during the second quarter for both Food and Product Care? And then related to that, was there any impact from tariffs on any part of the portfolio, Food or Product Care? And can you give us a sense as to the portfolio risks associated with tariffs that have been implemented and also those that are being contemplated? Thanks so much.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Do you want to take the first one?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. So, in terms of the volume, yeah, I think we were very happy with the volume. You noted some softness in the Food Care equipment business. We view that to be timing. We're very happy about the level of orders that have come in right now in our Food Care North America business and equipment and we certainly expect that volume to come back relative to that. We're happy with the volumes in Product Care as well. As Ted noted, we did get some softness in the traditional Bubble Wrap and shrink.","Some of the shrink deterioration is really in maturing markets, shrink packaging that would go around a CD, a DVD, a magazine, something like that. So some of that deterioration was really expected as that would go.","And as it relates to tariff, there's a lot of things happening on tariffs. Certainly, we're watching the political environment very, very closely on that. And relative to tariffs on imports, we're viewing that as much like a freight cost increase that we might get and have to absorb, which we would then pass along to our customers. And I think Ted would want to comment on the tariffs on the exports.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure. And just one other comment on Food Care, on the equipment. As Bill highlighted in our prepared remarks, we had tough comparables in the second quarter from how strong the equipment was a year ago. But that does give us confidence on the second half because we have visibility of the orders there on the equipment that will turn into sales. So that's part of our confidence for the second half.","And just adding to Bill on the tariff, we've been watching the news as everybody of the noise of what's going on with tariffs, what could be applied, what couldn't be applied, but looking \u2013 and also many conversations with our customers. So, first, as far as for our customers and where we export \u2013 or where our customers produce in the U.S., we do have access to the markets that will be affected outside. Latin America, Brazil and Argentina could pick up some of that if the price in the U.S., and we are positioned well with our global footprint to handle that around the world.","On the tariffs, as Bill already highlighted, we are seeing some of that pressure in the quarter and we expect to see it on our product \u2013 our materials that we ship outside the United States. And our plan is to pass that price on. Our competitors are seeing the same thing. So we need to be firm in that ensuring that is a pass-through price.","Operator","Thank you. It looks like our next question in queue will come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the details, too. Ted, my question is on expectations for the quarter, relative performance with two parts. In Food, you mentioned that you didn't quite have the operating leverage that you thought you were going to have, but then you also mentioned there were investments that were being made within the business, which, presumably, you would have known about going into the quarter. So help us or help me anyway understand how Food performed relative to your expectations with that investment and relative to your normal operating leverage target.","And then on expectations for Product Care, you talked a lot about machine installations in Food, but how did your machine installations do in Product Care on some of the higher value-add product lines you're trying to push into the market? Thank you.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. The short answer on the second on Product Care, net expectation, the real issue that you did identify on Food Care is some of the investments that we're making for additional capacity and new products. We are debottlenecking that, so the direct answer to the question, that was not to our expectation. We are making those investments. We spent more than we got in the quarter. It's a long-term investment, so we will see that in the future. We will pick some of that up into 2019. So we've got some efficiencies there that we're working on.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","So one follow-up comment to that would be, as you look at the comment that you raised and that we reiterated on the call relative to the PG ratio for Food Care being maybe a little disappointing to us, some of that you could understand by looking at our equipment business. We've indicated that that lagged a bit in the second quarter. That's high-margin business for us. And so as the equipment lags, the PG ratio would lag. But our PG ratio, we expect to double from what the total company ended 2017 at. And as those equipment orders translate into deliveries and sign-offs by customers, we expect Food Care's profit-to-growth ratio to increase in Q3.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thanks. Operator?","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Our next question in queue will come from Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your question, please.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, and congrats on the progress with the price versus cost there. My question was really on the sort of the headlines around plastic that we're seeing, that's been sort of in the crosshairs for a bunch of consumer trends. I know you guys don't do much or anything on the single-serve side, but just wondering if you're seeing customers show a preference away from plastic packaging. I know the partnership with Kuraray seems like it fits right in with where these trends are going. But in general, are you seeing a lot of activity today or is this deal with Kuraray sort of preparing for what might come down the road?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes. We're definitely seeing the plastic issue right in front of our customers. We actually had two of our majors in this last quarter discussing that with us of what we can do. Our customers are definitely quite interested as we bring in renewable materials. But our focus on plastics or even with our film business, our scientists refer to it as skin, where our plastics are used for critical-use applications, both in protecting the packages, saving tremendous amount of waste and then for food as well, extending the shelf life, bringing fresh food to places and the positive benefit there.","We're going to continue the investment there. We made an organizational change I shared on the previous call. We moved sustainability into our innovation team and we'll continue the investment, both in products and people and process. But it is definitely on the minds of our customers, and we'll be continually working to see what we can do to improve our sustainability efforts. And actually, the word we're using internally with our customers is to lead with them in that process.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Daniel Rizzo - Jefferies LLC","Morning. You mentioned briefly about freight cost or treating tariffs as freight cost. I was just wondering what your expectations are for freight in the second half as well as for input costs?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","The pass-through that we actually mentioned was the pass-through on the tariffs. But we got behind on the freight. Freight jumped up on us in the first half year, but our plan is to pass through the freight cost where we can with our customers. But the second element, the freight is actually giving us an opportunity to go and sit down with our customers. Can we do things to help them lower their freight costs? So, it's an opportunity. As I mentioned, our partnership with Amazon, it's a big issue on what we could do to help certify that our packages fit into the Amazon system. We got three new centers in place on that.","So, also on the resin piece, which is our highest input cost, seeing that go in, we saw that go up in the first half of the year. The trend still Q1 to Q2 has been flat sequentially. The first quarter was up 15%, second quarter approximately 10%. We're seeing and looking into the third quarter on resins to be somewhat flat, and our guidance has it flat to slightly up. There is some chatter and noise that this could be coming down. We heard that again last quarter. We didn't see it. So, our guidance has the resin input cost to be flat and slightly up.","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","So, specific to your question about the freight, Product Care was able to roll out a very successful price increase on April 1 in North America that covered a variety of input costs, and freight was a significant component of those costs. And those price increases were well received. They have stuck as we indicated. We've also indicated that if we have future freight increases that we fully intend to pass those along to customers as well.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Our next question in the queue will come from Adam Josephson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Adam Jesse Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple on your guidance. You mentioned that the expected better operating leverage in the second half will offset the incremental FX drag of $25 million for the full year. Can you just help me understand where that expected better operating leverage is coming from? And particularly, just given the magnitude of the $25 million of better operating leverage seems quite a bit relative to your expectation three months ago. And I'm assuming that AFP won't contribute much to your EBITDA for the year. And just relatedly, your FX assumptions for the second half related to the guidance. I appreciate that.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","You want to take it?","William G. Stiehl - Sealed Air Corp.","Sure. So, on this one (35:59), I would say that we're very, very pleased with where we ended up in price mix for both Food Care and Product Care. Product Care moved into a positive price mix at the first part of the second quarter, Food Care moved into a positive price mix in the middle to the later part of the second quarter. We anticipate both of our businesses to maintain positive price mix through the balance of the year. That will contribute to our improvements in operating leverage that we're expecting for the balance of the year.","You are correct that even though our acquisitions are accretive, they would not necessarily improve our operating leverage in the first year after the deal would close. But we see the price mix improving. I previously had mentioned the Food Care equipment sales, that will be picking up as we move through the second half of 2018. And then also you appropriately noted the FX movement. Our prior guidance had sales of $110 million impact on FX and EBITDA of $20 million on a positive basis. Our new guidance, as you will see, sales is negative $20 million, EBITDA is negative $5 million. Where that's impacting us most is, indeed, our Food Care business. And the specific currencies that are involved are the euro, the Brazilian real, Argentinian peso and the Australian dollar. And those are also the currencies that represent a large portion of our sales. The biggest one there would have been that I mentioned, the euro, which represents 14% of our total sales.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your question, please.","Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just had a question on the volume versus price kind of situation for the second half. You do face some relatively tough comps in both Food Care and Product Care in the 4% to 6% range. And your price is actually above us this quarter. So, what's the outlook for how price mix trends from here? I mean, should we remain in that kind of plus 4% to 6% range and then volumes should be back down in the 1% to 2% range? Or do you feel like you can comp in mid-single digits against those tougher comps in the back half? Thanks.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes. For the second half we still think it's going to be the same. It's going to be more on the price mix than the volume. We think we'll have volumes slightly up but we're going to do it mostly on the price mix.","On the Food Care side, we think we still have opportunities in our shrink bags, our top products that we think we have opportunities there. And as we keep highlighting, what we didn't get in that second quarter on Food Care was the equipment. We think we have an opportunity and good margin for that coming through. We also do believe we've got a pretty good pipeline of some of our new products coming through especially in the fluids and we think that's an opportunity for the second half of the year.","On Product Care, we still see a continued demand for some of our new products, our Korrvu, the e-commerce business is still strong. Yes, definitely, we think we have the right price mix on this. We're not anticipating gaining where we do have pricing issues, on our traditional Bubble Wrap and film, but we do have tough comps in the second half on volume. And right now, it looks like it's going to be a price mix coming through in the second half of the year.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. How are you?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Good.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. So my questions have to do a little bit with the acquisitions of whole list of (40:12) plastics. So, firstly, it seems like you're expanding to other \u2013 to, I guess, non-plastic resin areas. You mentioned AFP, they use a different type of raw material. And I was wondering, how do you see the challenges in your Product Care packaging segment with regard to plastic. You mentioned, for example, Bubble Wrap, shrink film had some challenges in the quarter. And while some of it is cannibalization, do you see any concern that going forward, some customers may want to switch away from, let's say, Bubble Wrap to something more sustainable? And are you doing these acquisitions to address these concerns?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yes. Well, first of all, on the AFP acquisition, we're actually \u2013 we'll be bringing our EcoPure into that line, which is a sugarcane-based resin. So that's actually in our current portfolio that's going to help the synergies there. On the M&A, though, some of the acquisitions that we're looking at are in the technology space that will help us with the Product Care business. So, as far as the push on plastics that we already talked about, we're definitely seeing that issue there.","But the sustainable, the reusable piece, we still think that's a growth opportunity because especially in the Bubble Wrap and e-commerce, the sustainability issue, we're replacing our products. We're replacing polystyrene, which is Styrofoam. We're reducing the amount of packaging material. So, there's still a lot to be gained on the sustainability footprint with our traditional Bubble Wrap. So we see that still an opportunity for growth. And actually that inflatable Bubble Wrap was up double-digit in the quarter, and we expect that growth to continue.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Gabe S. Hajde - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was really kind of thinking about your CapEx mix, and you talked about being more heavily weighted towards some restructuring efforts and maintaining the business and looking forward shifting to more growth\/return-type projects. Can you talk about just \u2013 I mean, you mentioned ROIC as a framework. What types of hurdle rates or targets that you look for in these projects and maybe where geographically they might be centered around?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. We're using \u2013 basically looking at the ROIC to possibly beat our cost of capital, which is quite interesting if we look at the $160 million of spend in the capital and where is that returning. I mentioned in the second quarter in Food Care, we're investing in some new technology that could, as we go into new markets, that we can offer looking for a step function change in our productivity. So looking at the CapEx hurdle rate, we've been scrubbing what we're looking, can we do 20%, 30% ROIC in some of our existing facilities, and maybe looking at it a little bit differently, can we get fully automated facilities instead of today, we have a lot of batch processing in our facilities.","So, I think we have an opportunity. Part of that 70% spend in the past was for various reasons. We don't have those reasons going forward. So, I think the investment internally on our CapEx, and especially in the productivity of our facilities around the world, we have some significant opportunity to drive productivity and to drive growth.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Anojja Shah with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your question, please?","Anojja Shah - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. My question is around capital allocation and how you're prioritizing the main buckets. I know you're \u2013 we've talked a lot about CapEx. And then you have another $900 million for share repurchases. And then clearly, you're interested in M&A. So just any sort of sense on your priorities there, which one you're focused on most or any comments around that?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Well, again, it ties into using it \u2013 our returns and where we can offer the most returns to the business. So, as we shared on the M&A opportunities, looking where we can get growth into our existing footprint, existing markets, and where we can get a higher return for growth. So, we're quite \u2013 but using ROIC there as a guide, we're not looking to overspend in that as well, and that's why the ROIC is a good guide for us. We're also looking not to go away from our core competencies. So, that's the guide there on the M&A.","As I mentioned internally, the capital allocation internally, I think we have some opportunities on our facilities and put our internal CapEx to get higher returns. Then the third piece there was on the share buyback. And putting all three of those in the mix, where we can create the highest returns, on the accretion of the share buybacks, we're looking at that very carefully, the $100 million, if we put out there on an M&A, that's got to beat the returns on a share buyback. So, we're looking at that quite carefully.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Our next question in queue will come from Edlain Rodriguez with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Just one quick one on that partnership with Amazon, like what does it really do for you? I mean, does it have any financial impact? Does it help you grow the Product Care business? I mean, if you could just elaborate on that a little bit.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah, it's a good question. What it allows us is we get to use our \u2013 we have three certification facilities that we take products and we can certify those products, similar to get a stamp of approval, similar to what you do in the equipment world, where you would have a UL approval. This would be the Amazon approved for this SKU that it has packaging material that will help them in their distribution centers and their packaging. And if you don't have that symbol, you could pay a penalty. What it means for us, for our three facilities, we have one in the U.S. that's been certified, one in Europe, and one in Asia that we do charge for this. And it's an opportunity part of that Amazon partnership that our brand will mean that it's Amazon-approved and should help the growth for our own products going through the Amazon network.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Yes, ma'am. We do have a follow-up question from the line of Scott Gaffner with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Yeah. Just a couple of quick follow-ups, first on Product Care, I think you would \u2013 company had bought or did a JV with an alternative product care company a few years back on the mycelium-based packaging, can you just update us on that?","And then, Ted, just focusing on \u2013 I mean, you sort of teased out the 2019-2020, sounds like there's a lot more to come there. But when we look at this CapEx that you're talking about moving more towards growth CapEx, should we expect volume trends then to accelerate relative to the market that you participate in? Thanks.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Okay. Scott, I hate to say, your first question, I don't know the answer to, so if we can follow-up on that one. I apologize at least in my nine months that I don't know the answer to that one.","But as far as the CapEx, first of all, just to make sure, taking a look at the CapEx that we described fitting into our cash flow targets and where our growth is but, yes, I do believe getting our facilities more efficient, our network more efficient, can help to drive our growth expectations going into 2019-2020 and beyond. So, some of these adjacent markets that are next to us that want our products, where we have bottlenecks today in our portfolio, I think it will help drive our growth into the future. And we'll follow up with you on your other question after the call.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Operator?","Operator","Yes, ma'am. Our next follow-up question will come from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your question, please.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, guys, Salvator Tiano again. Just a follow-up, I don't know if I missed, but I don't think Brazil was discussed in detail. And I know, obviously, it wasn't a big issue for you because you have Latin America volume growth in the double digits. But what was kind of the impact of the strike there? And did it hit your volume growth in any meaningful way, as we saw for some of your peers?","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Yeah. Brazil was actually a highlight for us in the quarter. Now, in the first half, as you highlighted, the trucking strike actually slowed us down. We've had issues with Brazil in the last year, but actually Brazil is a bright spot for us for a number of reasons. One, we got some significant wins in the quarter from our team, doing quite well there.","We also see Brazil as growth for us. The majority of the fresh red meat that ships out of Brazil, which \u2013 its export capability will increase, is frozen. But as see that shift going to fresh red meat, we're connected to that. And again, if this tariff does hit in the U.S., the growth there in Brazil to pick up some of the European and Asia protein needs will be picked up. So, we see continued opportunity. So, answer to the first question, yes, to this part, strong growth for us in the quarter, and we're looking for continued strong growth out of Brazil going forward.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Great. Thank you, Ted. I think, operator, we have one more question in the queue?","Operator","That is correct. Absolutely. We have time for one more question. Our final question in the queue will come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the follow on. Ted, could you talk a little bit about what trends you saw with foam-in-place packaging? And then more broadly within Product Care, recognizing that the volume losses in some of the more mature product lines, you attributed to cannibalization and pricing actions but from your nine months in the job and what you've heard from your colleagues, anything in that \u2013 weakness in volume in those categories concerning in terms of the economic outlook or purely one-off and strategic? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.","Edward L. Doheny II - Sealed Air Corp.","Thanks. Actually, really good question. We're not actually going to share specifically some of the M&A opportunities we're looking at. But looking at the Product Care space, the ones that we're interested in this integrated fabricator, we learned from Fagerdala having that direct access to these growth markets, where we've seen the integrators moving into the electronics and especially even some of the push back to the U.S. with some of the U.S. manufacturing.","So, we see an opportunity there, so some of the other growth opportunities for us, on the Product Care side, is internal development in the automation space. That's in my nine months that our customers are asking for help in automation in their facilities. We have products today but we see continued growth. We're developing our own in products internally but we're looking for Product Care opportunities that we can help our customers in the automation of their processes in packaging. So, that's where we see some opportunities.","Lori C. Chaitman - Sealed Air Corp.","Thank you, George, and thank you, Ted.

[Operator Instructions].","I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I would like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com. ","I would like to remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for future periods are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-looking Statements in our earnings release and slide presentation, which applies to this call. ","Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov.

","With that, I'll turn the call over to Ted Doheny, our President and CEO. Ted?","Edward Doheny","Thank you, Lori, and thank all of you for joining us for our third quarter earnings conference call. On today's call, I'll start out with a quick recap of our third quarter results and discuss how Reinvent SEE strategy is transforming Sealed Air to a world-class company. This is an exciting journey, and we're making great progress. I'll then discuss the status of the integration of Automated Packaging Systems and how this will accelerate our growth. I'll conclude with an update on the progress we are making on our sustainability goals in our 2025 pledge. Jim will expand on our financial results for the quarter and provide more details on our outlook for 2019. We will end the call with the Q&A session. ","Turning now to our third quarter results on Slide 3. In constant dollars, we delivered 12% adjusted EBITDA growth on 5% higher sales compared to last year. Our top line performance was largely attributable to higher volumes in food packaging and contribution from our recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 130 basis points to 19.8%, and we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.64, a 5% increase over last year. ","While we continue to face macroeconomic challenges around the world and within the markets we serve, our Reinvent SEE strategy is driving share gains and significant productivity improvements. This enabled us to deliver strong EBITDA growth in the quarter and position us to reaffirm our 2019 earnings and free cash flow commitments. More importantly, we are strengthening the structural earnings power of the company. ","Slide 4 reiterates our vision, our strategy and how we're making all of this happen. Our vision is to transform Sealed Air from the best in packaging to a world-class company servicing the global packaging industry. Today, we are the leading innovator in packaging and are making a difference in the industries we serve with automated equipment, service and materials. At the same time, we're reinventing the business from how we innovate to how we solve. Our Reinvent SEE work streams are designed to accelerate profitable growth, drive operational excellence, develop a high-performance culture and deliver long-term value for our customers, shareholders, employees and the society where we live and work. ","Let's turn to Slide 5, which illustrates how our team is taking our 4P'S of Reinvent SEE, performance, people, products, processes and sustainability to world class. We are investing smarter to accelerate the speed to market of our new innovations in food and Protective Packaging. We're making advancements in our materials for proteins, including seafood and plant-based protein alternatives in fluids. ","For Protective Packaging markets, we're introducing a new reinvented version of our Bubble Wrap brand in 2020 that contains more than 90% recycled material while providing the same level of protection and air retention as our original Bubble Wrap brand. We continue to invest to strengthen our capabilities in automation, sustainability and digital. ","We've been making changes across our manufacturing and distribution network to enable us to drive the best products at the right price and make them sustainable. We have seen gross margin improvements from our Reinvent SEE work streams in plant productivity, network efficiencies and procurement savings. Throughout our global operations, by acting as 1 Sealed Air, we have been able to realize savings in multiple functions throughout the organization. This has given us the ability to move and respond faster to the markets we serve and the adjacent markets we are targeting. ","As we head to year-end and plan for 2020, we're adding new reinvent work streams on revenue and service to drive top line improvements. We're focusing on driving integrated customer solutions with our automated equipment, service and materials. We're expanding the capabilities of our commercial teams by providing them with more resources, launching new campaigns to drive market share gains and accelerate commercialization of our newest innovations. ","We're enhancing our service leadership by leveraging Automated Packaging Systems' technical service excellence and expanding our own best practices globally. ","I want to share the integration of Automated Packaging Systems is going very well. Our sales teams have attended training and collaboration meetings, verifying cross-selling prospects around the world. We collaborated at 3 major trade shows in the U.S. and Europe, and held a summit to accelerate innovation projects and growth. ","While it's still early, we had a handful of cross-selling orders in North America, Europe and Asia in the quarter and are optimistic about our opportunities in 2020. ","Now let's turn to sustainability on Slide 6, which is at the heart of our purpose statement: To leave the world better than we found it. Looking back over the last year, sustainability concerns across the packaging industry have increased around the world. We have made progress on our internal operations and our 2025 sustainability pledge. These investments have been driven by our focus on operational excellence and by increasing market demand for more sustainable packaging solutions. Our goal is to deliver the best products at the right price and make them sustainable. ","Recently, we published our 2019 sustainability report where you can learn more about how Sealed Air is working to move the needle on sustainability and build a more circular economy. We're proud to report that we've exceeded our 2020 sustainability goals 2 years ahead of schedule on resource intensity, which includes greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water. On waste, we've been diverting nearly 80% of our waste from landfills. More than half of our facilities today are delivering on our 2020 goal of achieving 100% waste diversion. ","Employee safety is paramount to us. Our goal is to achieve zero harm across our global facilities. Year-to-date, we're pleased to have reduced our total recordable incident rate by 10%, with more than 65% of our facilities achieving zero harm. ","On our 2025 sustainability pledge, we're making meaningful progress towards delivering solutions that are recyclable or reusable and contain post-consumer or post-industrial recycled content. Investments in our portfolio are geared towards our 2025 commitments. ","In the third quarter, we had 3 Protective Packaging solutions to our list of recyclable offerings. Our reinvented Bubble Wrap material and StealthWrap shrink film have been recently certified for store dropoff recycling. The new version of Bubble Wrap is not only made from recycled content but also has a 40% lower total carbon footprint than our existing product. Our StealthWrap Automated Packaging System replaces larger, heavier secondary boxes and provides improved efficiency by reducing dimensional weight during distribution. ","We also received third-party certification for curbside recyclability for our paper-based TempGuard biothermal assurance product. Across the packaging value chain, we are widely recognized as a leader in essential, flexible packaging committed to build a circular economy and reducing our customers' carbon footprint through innovation and collaboration. We strongly believe our investments will accelerate our growth trajectory. Looking ahead, our product road map puts us on track to achieve our 2025 objectives. ","I'll now pass the call to Jim to review our results in more detail. Jim?","James Sullivan","Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 7, we'll start with a review of our net sales by region. In the third quarter, sales increased 3% as reported and 5% in constant dollars. We delivered growth across all regions, which included 2 months of sales contribution from Automated Packaging Systems. In constant dollars, North America, our largest region, representing 60% of the company sales, grew 4% year-over-year. EMEA was up 5%, and Asia Pacific was up 3%. South America, where we have U.S. Dollar Index pricing, was up 21%. ","Turning to Slide 8. Here, we highlight our volume and price trends by business segment and by region. In the third quarter, overall volume, excluding acquisitions, was down 1%. Food Care volume was up 2%, with favorable trends across all regions. This was more than offset by a 5% volume decline in Product Care. ","The industrial manufacturing slowdown and ongoing trade disputes hit our Product Care business the hardest in North America and Asia Pacific, where we had organic volume declines of 7% and 5%, respectively. In EMEA, Product Care volume was up slightly, with growth in automated equipment offsetting economic softness in Europe. Favorable overall price performance was driven by the U.S. Dollar Index pricing in South America. And as we anticipated, price in North America was down 1% primarily due to resin-based formula pricing in Food Care. ","On Slide 9, we present our year-over-year sales and adjusted EBITDA bridges for the third quarter and year-to-date. Starting with the quarter, organic sales, which exclude acquisitions and currency translation, were essentially flat year-over-year. Automated Packaging Systems accounted for $48 million of the $62 million of sales from acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA of $241 million increased $22 million or 10% compared to last year, with margins up 130 basis points to 19.8%. This increase was largely attributable to our Reinvent SEE initiatives and favorable price\/cost spread. ","In price\/cost spread, we benefited from Reinvent SEE actions that are structurally lowering our direct materials and transportation costs and increasing value capture. We also benefited from market-driven lower input costs relative to last year. Higher operating costs were largely due to labor and indirect material and services inflation, increased incentive compensation and incremental investments in the business, partially offset by Reinvent SEE benefits from network optimization, manufacturing supply chain process improvements, procurement savings and other organizational efficiencies. We also realized $21 million of savings from restructuring actions. ","Operational EBITDA from the addition of Automated Packaging Systems for 2 months in the quarter was offset by a $7 million noncash purchase accounting inventory charge, and currency translation was also $4 million unfavorable to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter was $0.64 on average diluted shares outstanding of 155 million. This compares to $0.61 in the third quarter of 2018. Automated Packaging Systems was $0.04 dilutive on adjusted EPS in the current quarter and included $0.07 of noncash purchase accounting items. ","The adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 28.5% compared to 27.8% in the third quarter 2018. Year-to-date, the adjusted tax rate was 25.5%. And for the full year, we continue to expect the rate to be approximately 26%. Turning your attention to our year-to-date EBITDA bridge. You can see we have realized approximately $123 million of Reinvent SEE benefits, with $47 million coming from restructuring. Reinvent SEE has exceeded our expectations, and we are now on track to achieve approximately $150 million in total benefits for the year, with approximately $65 million coming from restructuring savings. This is a $15 million increase in our full year outlook for Reinvent SEE benefits, which has positioned the company to reaffirm its adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow guidance despite lower projected sales. ","Turning to our results by segment on Slide 10. We present third quarter and year-to-date results for Food Care. For the quarter, Food Care net sales of $730 million were up 2% organically and up 3% in constant dollars. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $160 million, with margins improving 190 basis points to 21.9%. Global protein markets were up about 1% in the third quarter compared to our Food Care volume, which was up 2%. By region, our volume was up 3% in both South America and Asia Pacific, up 2% in North America and up 1% in EMEA. Overall, our volume of materials was up 3%, which was partially offset by a decline in North American equipment sales due to a tough year-over-year comparison. ","Our top line performance was driven by local protein consumption, strong exports and continued adoption of sustainable solutions. Increased consumer demand for fresh protein continues to drive penetration of our case-ready platform across all proteins. The export market for beef, poultry and pork continues to strengthen, particularly in North America and South America, largely due to the impact the African swine fever is having on pork production in China and surrounding countries. ","In sustainability, we are gaining share globally with our solutions that contain recycled materials and offer post-consumer recyclability. It is also worth noting that we are seeing incremental growth opportunities in adjacent markets, including fluids, seafood and alternative proteins. For the full year 2019, global protein production is projected to be up 1.5%. Our Food Care team has been outperforming the market, and we expect this trend to continue going forward. However, due to the timing of certain new equipment deliveries and a weaker macroenvironment in Europe, we are revising our full year 2019 constant dollar sales outlook for Food Care to 3.5% versus 4%. ","On Slide 11, we highlight results from our Product Care segment. In the third quarter, Product Care net sales of $489 million were up 8% in constant dollars. Excluding Automated Packaging Systems acquisition, Product Care net sales were down 5% due to volume declines on essentially flat pricing trends. The volume decline in the quarter was primarily with our specialty industrial applications and traditional packaging solutions. Adjusted EBITDA of $84 million or 17.2% of sales was up 10%, and margins expanded 60 basis points. Restructuring savings, favorable price\/cost spread and other benefits from Reinvent SEE were partially offset by lower volumes, higher operating costs and the inventory purchase accounting charge associated with the Automated Packaging Systems acquisition. ","In Product Care, we continue to work on our portfolio to focus on automation and sustainability. Value-added solutions, which include automated equipment, inflatables, paper systems, core view and temperature assurance, were up 6% on an organic basis in the third quarter. When you include the contribution from Automated Packaging Systems, this segment of our business now accounts for roughly 1\/3 of Product Care. Our traditional packaging solutions, which includes Bubble Wrap, standardized mailers, shrink film and void fill, were down 7% organically and still account for 1\/3 of our Product Care sales. This part of the segment has been adversely impacted by the market shifting to automation and sustainable solutions and the global industrial manufacturing slowdown. ","As Ted noted, we are bringing more recyclability to this portfolio with a new version of Bubble Wrap in 2020 and recently, a recyclable cushioned mailer. Our specialty industrial applications, which include the Instapak platform and integrated fabrication solutions, account for the remaining 1\/3 of our Product Care sales, and this part of Product Care was down 7% organically due to lower global industrial demand and the ongoing trade dispute with China. While the market cycle has been challenging, we are working with customers to upgrade their packaging to be parcel-ready, which brings more efficiency and less waste to the distribution channel. ","For the full year, we now estimate Product Care constant dollar sales growth to be 6% compared to our previous guidance of 7%. Organic sales are now expected to be down approximately 4% compared to our previous forecast of down 3%. It is important to note that while our top line outlook has come down throughout the year, a more favorable sales mix, combined with Reinvent SEE benefits, have resulted in higher margins in Product Care. ","Now let's turn to year-to-date free cash flow on Slide 12. In the 9 months ended September 30, we generated $110 million of free cash flow compared to $35 million in the same period in 2018. The year-over-year improvement was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower cash tax payments, partially offset by increased investment in CapEx and our Reinvent SEE programs. Net debt at the end of the third quarter totaled $3.7 billion. Net debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis for the Automated Packaging Systems acquisition was 3.8x. As we previously communicated, we expect pro forma net leverage to be approximately 3.7x by the end of 2019 driven by cash generation and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. ","Turning to our updated outlook on Slide 13. We now anticipate net sales to be approximately $4.8 billion or about 1.5% growth for the year as reported. On a constant dollar basis, net sales are expected to increase approximately 4.5%. Food Care growth of 3.5% includes just over $10 million from the smaller strategic acquisitions completed in the second quarter. Product Care growth of 6% includes $180 million from acquisitions, of which approximately $120 million is expected to come from Automated Packaging Systems for the 5 months ending December 31, 2019. ","We are reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA for the full year in the range of $950 million to $960 million. This outlook includes $10 million to $12 million of adjusted EBITDA from Automated Packaging Systems, which is inclusive of the $7 million noncash inventory purchase accounting charge. It also includes unfavorable currency translation for the year of $30 million, which is up about $5 million from our previous guidance. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA -- or adjusted EPS, excuse me, to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.80. Our guidance assumes approximately $0.07 of dilution from Automated Packaging Systems. Our outlook for adjusted EPS is based on roughly 155 million shares outstanding and does not assume additional share repurchases for the remainder of the year. ","We are reaffirming our forecast for free cash flow of $180 million. Our CapEx for the full year is on track for $210 million, which includes $10 million for Automated Packaging Systems. We continue to expect to Reinvent SEE, restructuring and associated payments to be about $115 million in 2019. ","Let me now pass the call back to Ted for closing remarks.","Edward Doheny","Thank you, Jim. We will continue to push forward on our journey to world class and aggressively go after opportunities with Reinvent SEE. Reinvent SEE is about accelerating profitable growth and increasing earnings power. As illustrated on Slide 14, you can see how we are reinventing our powerful brands in operating as one company. Our 4P'S of Reinvent SEE are increasing efficiency in an unleashing growth. We're excited for what's ahead, and we'll continue to focus on what's in our control to drive our success and create value for our shareholders. ","With that, I'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.","Tyler Langton","Just on the Reinvent SEE there, I guess, sort of the savings have kind of steadily moved up throughout the year. I guess just in terms of offsets with EBITDA sort of not moving up as much, is it Product Care volumes, FX, higher operating expenses? Just wondering if you could provide any sort of color on what have been sort of the biggest offsets sort of versus your estimates.","James Sullivan","Well, when we started here -- this is Jim. When we started the year, we certainly had greater expectations for volumes across the business. And where we're at right now with increasing the benefits from this program, we're able to drive EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA to a higher level than when we started the year and have seen an awful lot of margin improvement. So I think at the most basic level, what's going on with Reinvent has more than offset the volume declines for the year and the currency translation drag on the business.","Operator","Our next question is George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","I guess my first question, and obviously, we'll turn it over there, can you give a bit more color in terms of the volume decline in Product Care? In the third quarter, it was down 5%. Considering that last year was a relatively challenging quarter is an easy comparison for Product Care. And as you move into the fourth quarter, the comps get a bit tougher. Can you give us some additional color in terms of how the volumes are progressing year-on-year in Product Care, especially in the categories as you laid them out?","Edward Doheny","Thanks, George. This is Ted. Looking at Product Care, and if we unpack what's going on and if we compare it to year-over-year, the third quarter, as you highlighted last year, we saw a drop. In the third quarter of last year, we had an issue with an automated piece of our portfolio that was going away. That's still leaking away in business and probably won't be out until the end of next year. ","But if you look at the portfolio, as Jim highlighted and I highlighted in our prepared remarks, if you break it up in pieces, the market being down 5% in the industrial -- our industrial portfolio that matches that with the Instapak and our specialty foams, et cetera, that's matching pretty well with the market. If we look at the utility products or the commodity products where we talk about the Bubble Wrap -- traditional Bubble Wrap, we've also seen that's matched with the market going down, in some cases, even more. Where we've seen -- if we look at the portfolio, though, we've seen some strong growth. And actually counter to the Bubble Wrap traditional, it's been our Bubble Wrap on demand. It's actually been our fastest-growing product as we continue to focus on automation, and that's what the market is asking for. How do we automate fulfillment centers, our customers' operations? And that actually has been growing at double-digit, and we've had margin expansion in that piece. So we're looking at that whole portfolio and unpacking it, focus, and we keep talking about the automated equipment. That actually is up also double-digit. We're working with the portfolio, though, to get that connected to materials. In some cases, it's not connected to our materials, and we're working very aggressively to get that connected. ","And then looking at globally, we have some positives. Our European team has actually had flat to growth in -- but with some of the new products. They're seeing that sustainability push much tougher than anywhere in the world. And we've seen our new mailer come online quickly. I was pretty impressed how quickly they brought that new product to market. More to come in this quarter and in 2020. So we're aggressively going after the Product Care portfolio. We have things that are growing. It's got hit by the market. We don't want to be an excuse, but we've got to address that. We've got to move the portfolio quicker, and we've got to get the new products to market fast, and that's what we're working on.","Operator","Our question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.","Arun Viswanathan","I just wanted to ask a little bit of a higher level strategy question. A couple of years ago, the company sold Diversey, and the path forward looked like differing the stranded costs and then continuing to kind of invest in your Food Care and Product Care business. When you look back -- and that sale, unfortunately, was dilutive to earnings, and we were at a $3 base, and we went down to about $2.50 base. So it seems like you're digging yourself out of that hole, but I just wanted to get your own perspective on kind of where you stand in the transformation. And if you could just tie in how much of your product base that you would consider specialty or potentially noncommoditized at this point, that would be helpful.","Edward Doheny","Okay. But I appreciate your summary. And if we look at the strategy of the separation of Diversey, the only comment I'll make on that from the past, it really didn't feel like with a similar business to us. And one of the things with our strategy on Reinvent is how do we act as one company and focused on our purpose statement that we're in the business to protect, focusing on our customers' most challenging packaging issues in making the world better, and we found that. So if we looked at the portfolio of Food Care and Product Care, we're actually acting as one. We actually have many, many market verticals to meet that. And that's where our focus has been, our strategy. ","And then on the operational side of that, focusing on automated equipment. That is in both businesses. That's been part of the growth of our Food Care, and more to come. And the same thing with the automated equipment on Product Care. So we see that synergy there. The acquisition of APS was how do we go faster into that space. ","The other piece is we're focusing on things -- even with our sustainability, focusing on things that are -- the plastics world of essential versus nonessential. So we see that -- our two portfolios having the same issue there. ","Even in the packaging of Food Care, we're looking at can we bring our Protective Packaging solutions? With Product Care, can we bring some of that material expertise that we have together? So strategically, we see a lot of similarities. The adjacent markets, we're seeing quite clearly. We've talked about some of our growth in temperature assurance. With APS, close to 20% of their business was in food, and we've learned a lot of things of how they do high-speed loading of bags, great synergies that we see already with our Food Care business. ","So the strategy is to focus on packaging, focus on the critical packaging, focus on having the best materials, having multiple materials in our sustainable world, if it's paper, if it's plastic or if it's a protective material that no one else has, that's what we're focused on. And then also the strategy is on the operations side. Let's be more efficient on how we go to market. And so that's the backbone behind Reinvent SEE as well. So I think we're making good progress, and I think more good things to come.","Operator","Neel Kumar with Morgan Stanley.","Neel Kumar","The $150 million in Reinvent SEE benefits you're now expecting for the full year implies about $27 million for the fourth quarter given you've done $123 million year-to-date. It seems that it's been about $50 million of benefits for the last 2 quarters. So I was just wondering if there's any reason why this was slowed down in the fourth quarter or perhaps you're may be incorporating some conservatism.","James Sullivan","Yes. This is Jim. I think we like to see it coming through. We've got a very strong pipeline, and we've been really accelerating that pipe given the volume challenges that we have. So you're right, that math is exactly right. And hopefully, we beat it. But I would say that we pushed up a lot of that early in the year, and some of that will carry into the fourth quarter, and the new restructuring actions will be launched in the fourth quarter that will then help us as we lean into 2020. We still think we have a lot of opportunity, broadly on productivity and efficiency across our business that will position us well for next year. But yes, we like to underpromise and overdeliver when it comes to those kinds of things. But the team is working really hard. We talked last quarter about the governance structure and the culture change that this is driving within the company to, really, from idea generation to accountability making that fall through. So I don't think we want to put too much more in the fourth quarter than what we have, but I think we feel confident that -- enough that we were able to raise the forecast to offset the volume decline that we have in the business.","Edward Doheny","Yes, Neel, this is Ted. As Jim's point, I'll tag team on the underpromise, overdeliver and also to touch on the cultural piece there. Me being the optimist here, seeing really some good things that are happening. We had the whole management team in Europe and looking at the change in listening and watching and walking the shop -- the floor, seeing this Reinvent being lectured by where the opportunities are, seeing the plants work together, so the productivity -- I think we've just -- we're on a journey. And I think many, many more good things to come. ","The tough market is out there. We just have to fight through and go faster. But I think there's more opportunity to come that may not be seeing in our numbers in the fourth quarter and beyond. But I'm pretty positive. We got a lot of legs here.","Operator","Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Bryan Burgmeier","This is actually Bryan Burgmeier sitting in for Anthony. Do you guys include the postconsumer and bio-based resin products in the value-added portion of Product Care? And can you provide some color on the growth rate of your sustainable products in 3Q or year-to-date?","Edward Doheny","Yes. I think if I understand your question, yes, if it's the post the recycled content and postconsumer is in the Product Care numbers. I'm not sure if I understand, if you had more detail on that.","Bryan Burgmeier","Well, I'm just wondering if you guys broke out the growth rate of the sustainable products that you've highlighted throughout the year in your slides, if you can just provide any color on how those products are selling year-to-date.","James Sullivan","Yes. The year-to-date for that value-added segment of the business is up high single digits year-on-year. In the third quarter, we talked about that being up about 6%. So it's down from what the year-to-date is. So we saw a little deceleration in that segment of the business in the third quarter. But overall, year-to-date, I would say, high single digits. And again, a piece of this business, I mean, is in -- we're in a bad cycle. Certainly, this is part of the business, even though we're -- it's value-added, has been impacted by a very difficult global manufacturing environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with G. Research.","Rosemarie Morbelli","I was wondering, Jim, if you could talk about the free cash flow expectations for 2020. If I look at the $115 million of restructuring, plus the Novipax settlement of $59 million this year, should we anticipate free cash flow just from those 2 items to increase by $174 million next year? Or are there some residuals?","James Sullivan","Well, that's a loaded question because one of the key drivers of free cash flow is adjusted EBITDA, and we've been able to demonstrate we can grow adjusted EBITDA even in a flat organic environment. So our hope would be even leading into '20 with the trajectory coming out of the back half of '19 that we're going to have some EBITDA improvement. So I think that will be a positive on cash flow year-over-year. ","You're right about the Novipax. That won't repeat. Let's call that $60 million in total. The investment side of Reinvent, which is driving the substantial benefits for the company, we're seeing the investment was $115 million this year. That will repeat not at that level next year, but think about that being $100 million-ish. Remember, this program on a cash basis, cash-on-cash was about a 3-year payback. So we've said when we launched this program that we expected $250 million of benefits over 3 years with about the equivalent amount -- a little less, maybe, on the cash side. So we'll have some more cash outflow next year in Reinvent. But hopefully, like we did this year, we're positioned well to overdeliver on the total benefits for the program. ","And then CapEx. CapEx, we did bump a bit for APS. I think -- think about 4% of sales for CapEx is a good number, and it gives us some good projects to continue to drive the inflation fighting productivity that we're going to see year in and year out in the business.","Operator","Adam Josephson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Adam Josephson","Jim, one more cash flow question. If I go through the bridge to all the items you laid out, I think the implied working capital drag for this year is about $70 million, correct me if I'm wrong, or perhaps there's something else in that $70 million besides working capital. Can you talk about what that missing piece is, the $70 million? And if it's all working capital, what exactly is going on there? And to the extent you're expecting a working capital drag this year, do you expect another one next year? Do you expect the working capital to flatline next year?","James Sullivan","Yes. I think the -- if you look at the underlying metrics with working capital and the key working capital items, as you know, our AR, if you look at the DSO of the business as we sit here at the end of the third quarter, we're like, call it, just over 38 days. And last year, we were at 39. So we're actually seeing some year-over-year improvement in that metric, excluding APS. APS, as a business, probably has about a day higher DSO. So that APS inclusion for the full year will put a little bit of a challenge into the metric. But overall, that's looking really good. And so I would expect that to be moving with that kind of 30 -- high 30s of DSO, and that will change with sales. ","AP probably is where we see the biggest year-over-year change from a cash perspective. The company accomplished a lot of really good things in terms of terms extension in 2018 that didn't repeat in 2019. So if you kind of look at the cash flows from that in '18 versus '19 with AP, it's -- the cash outflows are up. ","If you look at the underlying metric with AP, let's call it, 87 days a year ago, and we're sitting at about 79 days. So we've lost a little bit on the DPO metric. And I would say some of that is related to tradeoff that we're making in terms of as we deal with our suppliers. We talked a lot of benefits coming from things with procurement and that sort of thing. So there's a little bit of a tradeoff we're making on DPO to drive some of that supplier-related benefits that we're seeing in the business. ","I mean -- but if you look at the absolute level of the DPO at 79 days as we sit here today, that's a pretty good number that we'd stack up against most companies and say that, that's a good accomplishment. ","And then finally, inventory, we're up about a day year-on-year. So we're about 67 days as we sit here today. Certainly, some of the volume declines that we've experienced on the top line, we're adjusting the manufacturing to be in line with that and to drive structural inventory reduction. We're falling a little bit behind there, but we've got a lot of people that are focused on improving that as we go forward. ","And then really, with some of this CapEx that we're going to unleash on the business, the incremental CapEx above the maintenance level, I think, over time will drive really good improvements in the process flow within manufacturing that will structurally take out inventory. But that will take us a bit of time. I think as we think about next year, hopefully, that's an opportunity with what where we're at this year. But hopefully, that gives you a good sense. ","The number you quoted is directionally correct in terms of the outflow associated with our working capital. It may be a little bit higher than that, but you're in the ballpark.","Operator","Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde","So I wondered, Sealed Air has had a lot of restructuring programs over the years, and we're working on some pretty healthy numbers here with Reinvent SEE. I wondered if you could help us from just a big picture standpoint, how much of that do you think you can really hold on to? And how much of that cost takeout is just the price of kind of staying in the game every year of kind of running even with your competition who's also working on reducing costs?","Edward Doheny","Yes, good question, Mark. As we're looking -- part of this Reinvent SEE, I get asked the question even internally, when is it over? I believe this is an ongoing journey. So we're looking very carefully for structural change. [Indiscernible] even use those words. We're looking for a structural change of the business. Some of our investments will come back. But to -- the strategy that we're working on is how do we drive a productivity engine that is sustainable year-over-year. We're benchmarking all our processes, and we're looking at our cost structure. And the marketplace is expecting that we have a productivity improvement year-over-year.","As I think I shared on one of the previous calls, we looked over the last five years, and we saw the costs go up over five years and year-over-year and how do we build a structure that we're continuously bringing productivity? Also, productivity into the organizational structure. So we're changing the structure. We're looking at the layers and looking how we're effective and efficient so that cost doesn't come back. Where the cost is coming back, as Jim even highlighted on the CapEx, is where we're investing into automation, where we're investing into new tools, investing into digital, investing into e-commerce so that we can compete in this marketplace more effectively and efficiently so that we're not considered a serial restructure. I'll just say it, that's what people are saying? No. This is a fundamental transformation, changing the business for how we do business in the future. It's on a journey. We're making good progress. We've got more to come, more to come even after 2020, '21, 2022, and that's the culture change that we're driving.","James Sullivan","If I could just to add on to that a bit. And I'm the new guy kind of looking at this. When I came in, I heard an awful lot about Reinvent SEE all the way down the organization. And certainly, people understand this program. But I would say that tucked in to Reinvent SEE are the normal productivity type of continuous improvement actions that any company would take to fight inflation. And our inflation will run about $50 million a year. So $50 million of that $150 million that Ted talked about is really inflation fighting, continuous improvement. I wouldn't classify that as structural, but a lot of that where the other stuff is. And so that just would be a little bit more perspective maybe as a new person coming in that could be helpful.","Operator","It's Salvator Tiano with Vertical Research.","Salvator Tiano","So I wanted to clarify a little bit about how you see Product Care developing in the next few years. Firstly, if you can clarify a little bit when you provided the breakdown between the three buckets, I guess, utilities, industrial and the value-add, you mentioned, it's roughly 1\/3 each. Is that pro forma for APS? Or is it with a two month contribution? And how do you see this developing in the next couple of years given more secular headwinds in some parts of the business and the secular tailwinds to the value-add segment? And as a last point, can you let us know a little bit about kind of the margin differential between the three buckets there so we can a little bit understand how margins should progress, all else being equal, as the segment transforms?","James Sullivan","Let me take a few pieces of that type of question, and then I'll let Ted take the rest. I'll start with the last question because I remember it, it's margin differential. So the highest margin business would be the specialty Instapak integrated phone [indiscernible] in the value-added category, and those are very nice margins. The lower would be the -- what we call the traditional packaging systems, and that's where we're seeing probably the most structural loss of the business. I mean that business is being impacted by the manufacturing environment that we're in, but probably some of it is shifting into the value-added component where we're seeing that nice growth. ","The first part of your question was that as I broke that segment down and the results for the quarter, I was using only organic volume. So APS was not included in the growth rates that I quoted there. However, when I split the business between 1\/3, 1\/3 and 1\/3, simply, I did pro forma on an APS, and APS will be in that value-added part because, really, it's driving the automation and the sustainability the company seeks in this area. Ted might want to comment on how this is going to develop going forward.","Edward Doheny","Right. And so if I follow the beginning part of the question, if we look at the portfolio. If we look at, again, what is our automated equipment and let's just explain that. That's where we're loading a package, whether it's loading a bag. That's where we see the portfolio actually doing quite well. That business is growing double digit, but it's a small percentage. ","What we'd like about that business and on driving the strategy, that's where the stickiness is. Putting those assets in, helping our customers try the automation, APS does actually a much higher rate of that than our current Product Care portfolio. Then it's matching the materials to that. So higher speed, higher packaging. Again, looking at APS, they have a different material structures. They have a high recycled content, et cetera, but also looking at the whole company, we can help APS with some of our operational improvement, and we've already had our operations teams working together in seeing some of those efficiencies. We drive this portfolio to have the automated equipment. We really like that, but then also to have that materials that are dedicated to that equipment so we see some opportunities. ","So the portfolio is shifting and where we don't have the right margins -- and we've talked about mailers before. Mailers is a business that has been on the decline for us. But as I shared within Europe, as we reinvent that mailer with a sustainable product, we brought our operations teams in to get the price right. And that's why we're carefully using that strategy, best product, right price and make it sustainable. We've seen them pretty quickly stop that drop in a tough market in Europe. And we think we can do more of that on the mailer side in the U.S. market, in the Asia Pacific market. So we're attacking the portfolio. APS, I think, can help us go faster. And so we think we can grow it and grow it profitably, and that's what we're working on. It's going to take some time. Right now, we're doing it without market help. But actually, that's helping us go faster. So we feel good about that.","Operator","We have a question from Gabe Hajde with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gabrial Hajde","Ted, if I go to Slide 9 and I look at the EBITDA bridge, specifically, operating costs with the little asterisks, it's -- does that imply that there's $81 million of incremental operating cost because you saved $52 million, plus the $29 million? Is that -- I guess, help me -- is that the right way to think about it? And if it is, it sort of implies $100 million of nonmaterial-related inflation within the business versus what I used to think was around $30 million to $35 million. So -- and I guess maybe compare or contrast that with the comments that you made about making incremental investments in commercial and technical support.","James Sullivan","Yes. Let me jump in there. This is Jim. And the math you did there is absolutely spot on, so let's focus on that $80 million. If you gross up the operating cost bucket on the year-to-date bridge for the company, you get that $80 million number. We talked about inflation being $50 million for the year through 9 months. Think about that number being about $37 million. We also have, let's call it, about $8 million of increase associated with volume variance. As we work to bring our inventories down and more in line with the end market demand, we are seeing some uncovered fixed costs that are flowing through that bucket. ","We talked about incentive compensation. The company is driving very strong margin and leverage metrics, which are key components of the variable compensation plan for the company, and that is driving some year-over-year increases in that, which, again, are variable, they come in this year and then we reset for next year. ","And then probably the last big bucket there is what I'll call investments. Think about $15 million on a year-to-date basis and maybe $20-ish million for the year. And these are select investments the company is making to try to drive ROIC for the future. So these are longer-term investments that are flowing through the P&L where we hope to get good returns. Our ROIC goal is 15% or above, and so this is the pocket of money that we're selectively using to drive that. ","And so I said $15 million year-to-date. A big chunk of that Ted hit on earlier is digital and e-commerce. So we're wanting to put that capability in more broadly than the company that we have today. And then we have some other investments that are going on in there. But -- so your numbers are right, and this gets back to what I said to the prior question, which is Reinvent is the banner we use for all of our improvement, structural and inflation fighting. And that $50 million of inflation for the year, we've got to get that year in and year out. At least until we -- maybe Reinvent will be here forever, but we kind of teed it up as a three year type of thing. We'll fold it in there. But beyond that, we're going to have things that are going to drive that productivity improvement to at least offset inflation and hopefully more.","Operator","Daniel Rizzo with Jefferies.","Daniel Rizzo","You mentioned that both poultry and beef demand was fairly strong in the quarter. I was wondering how the trade war is affecting that and how you see it playing out going forward.","Edward Doheny","Yes. What's interesting, the biggest concern, I think, we shared with you last quarter was what was going on with pork. So if we look at our protein market, the pork actually issue in the quarter. We said for the year, it might be a $3 million headwind. Actually, we're fighting through that. It's a huge issue in China right now. We were in Brazil. We were in Europe, and we're seeing what's happening in the market. So we don't think -- we think we can fight through that headwind and actually maintain the growth in the protein market specifically, cover that, but it'll be covering China through Latin America, Brazil, mainly in the U.S. We've also seen some benefits because the customer is working with us to aggressively how can we ship pork quicker from the U.S. and from Brazil. The good news is their -- it was going frozen, but for them to go quick, where frozen, we don't really necessarily always get the bags, but since they want to go quick and they want to have a high level of protection, that looks like that's an upside opportunity for us going forward. ","We also think in -- we also think on the beef side, we do have challenges coming in with Australia right now with the droughts and the herd, that's an issue. But the U.S. right now so far is looking -- we'll maintain it. And plus, we're developing new products going beyond the beef, the poultry, the cheese markets with our liquids. So we think on the Food Care side, we have opportunities going into the end of the year into next year to fight -- you opened the comment with what's going on with the trade wars, et cetera. So those are challenges ahead, but we think those will actually turn opportunities for us in the long term. And the long term is in the next 6 months.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you.

My name is Matthew, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lori Chaitman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.","Lori Chaitman","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin our call today, I'd like to note that we have provided a slide presentation to help guide our discussion. This presentation can be found on today's webcast and can be downloaded from our IR website at sealedair.com.","I would like remind you that statements made during this call stating management's outlook or predictions for the future are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the information in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings release, which replies to this call. Additionally, our future performance may differ due to a number of factors. Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com.","We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP in the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release.","Please note that we will end the call by 11 a.m. today.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?","Jerome A. Peribere","Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. 2013 was a solid year for Sealed Air. We made significant progress on our Get Fit strategy. We increased EBITDA, excluding SARs, on a year-over-year basis by 7% in 2013 and this is only the second time the company has delivered EBITDA margin growth in 11 years and that should speak for this leadership team. I'm also very pleased that we held firm on our pricing initiatives, reinforced our efforts in the fourth quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we delivered favorable price\/mix trends in every division in every region. Our free cash flow performance was outstanding. In addition to our forecast on reducing working capital as the Grace settlement became more likely, we put forth a tremendous effort over the last few months of 2013 to generate cash. We generated $509 million of free cash flow.","The Grace settlement is a significant development and what I would call a major milestone. It brings closure to an important legal matter after more than a decade. We will no longer incur interest on the settlement liability and we anticipate meaningful cash tax benefits. This will provide us with additional financial flexibility and cash generation in future years.","And we're very happy with what we have accomplished in 2013. Not only have we started to change our go-to-market strategy, but we also rebranded the company, reorganized Diversey Care, reengaged our employees and set the foundation to reimagine the company. Along the way, we are improving the delivery on our objectives. Since we started this journey, we have heard -- we have heard -- you have heard us back -- talk about a more disciplined pricing strategy and passing on our raw material cost increases. We started that initiative in Q1 and Q2 with moderate success, but fully executed in Q4 with our price increase in North America effective as of November 1. You can count on us to continue to be very disciplined on this in the future and in light of the recent and announced cost increases in benzene, propane and polyolefin.","Let's now turn to our performance by region for the quarter and the year, which you will see on Slide 4 and 5 of our presentation, for a quick look at our fourth quarter and year-end performance. In the quarter, we continued to see solid sales growth in AMAT and Latin America, with constant dollar growth of 8% and 7%, respectively. Developing regions in total increased 9% in the quarter, accounting for approximately 26% of our sales. Sales in North America increased by 4% in constant dollar, which was mostly from our Food Care and Product Care divisions. Trends in developing regions have been consistent all year. North America performance has also performed relatively well.","In Europe and in Japan, Australia and New Zealand, or JANZ, we experienced more positive trends in the fourth quarter compared to the first 9 months of the year. In Europe, constant dollar sales increased 3%, led by 5% growth in both France and Spain and 2% growth in the U.K. Holland was essentially flat. Germany declined very slightly and Italy declined by 5%. But these 6 countries combined accounted for approximately 22% of the fourth quarter sales and sales in JANZ increased 3%, which was led by a 5% increase in New Zealand.","Slide 6 outlines our price\/mix and volume trends for the quarter and for the year. Overall, as I said earlier, we delivered positive price\/mix and increased volumes in Q4 for the whole year.","Let me now take you some more details by division. And turning to Slide 7, Food Care sales increased 4% in constant dollars with approximately 4% growth in packaging and nearly 5% growth in hygiene. We reported growth in all regions, led by 11% in AMAT and 7% in Latin America as these volumes continued to increase in the high single-digit low double-digit levels in this region. In North America and Europe, we increased sales approximately 4% and 3%, respectively, despite the ongoing single-digit declines in base production. And JANZ also increased sales by 2% with 11% growth in New Zealand. On a global basis, we are seeing strong growth in the fresh red meat and smoked unprocessed market segment, primarily driven by an increase in demand for our case-ready, quick and easy open solutions. In hygiene, we delivered 4% growth driven by strength in emerging markets with our clean-in-place solution and in beverage and brewing, despite the overall market conditions.","The trends we experienced in the fourth quarter and for the full year on a regional basis and market basis were very similar, with the exception of Europe and JANZ. For the year, Europe is -- was essentially flat on a constant currency basis, but delivered positive growth trends in the fourth quarter. Despite continuing negative trends in certain European countries, we gained share in the quarter and increased demand for our advanced product solutions and started to see a more stable economic environment. JANZ was also flat for the year, but delivered positive trends in Q4, as growth in New Zealand accelerated from Q3 to Q4.","Our favorable price\/mix performance was -- of just over 3% in the quarter, was attributable to our focus on driving pricing discipline within Sealed Air and our continued shift toward a more favorable product mix. For 2014, we expect beef production in Latin America and AMAT to continue at a similar growth rate that we experienced in 2013. This is expected to be offset by expected single-digit declines in North America and Europe.","As it relates to our Food Care business in developing -- in the developing regions, we will continue to benefit from not only rising beef production, but also increasing hygiene standards and demand from our innovative solutions. With the protein market expected to decline again in 2014 in North America and Europe, our growth in these regions will continue to depend on driving demand for our value-added services, including integration of systems automations, advanced food safety solutions and new products that provide convenience and drive consumption.","I wanted to briefly highlight the EBITDA margin performance that Food Care delivered in the quarter. While unfavorable supply chain costs and catch-up on incentive compensation for strong full-year performance negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, Food Care adjusted EBITDA, excluding SARs, increased by 8% for the full year 2013 and full year margin improved to 15.2% from 14.3% last year -- the year before, in 2012.","Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant currency basis were up 3%, driven by another strong performance in the developing regions and growth in all of our core sectors led by building care services. On a regional basis, constant currency sales growth in Q4 was up by approximately 13% in Eastern Europe, 8% in Latin America and 6% in AMAT. We have experienced similar growth trends in developing regions throughout the year. In Europe, constant dollar sales increased 3%, led by double-digit growth in France, Spain and Sweden. And this is our first quarter in 2013 where we saw positive trends in Europe while -- and while the recovery is fragile, this performance is worth noting.","As we experienced volumes -- as we anticipated, volumes in North America improved from the decline we experienced last quarter and sales were essentially flat in Q4 on a year-over-year basis. For the full year and for the first time in 10 years, Diversey Care in North America delivered top line growth. As we anticipated, volumes in North America improved from the decline we experienced last quarter and sales were essentially flat in the fourth quarter.","For the full year, again, we have experienced this top line growth. These trends -- this performance was attributable to growth across all core sectors as a result of new customer wins and product launches. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted EBITDA, excluding SARs, increased 10% in the quarter and 6% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter and for the full year was just north of 10%. This improvement was primarily driven by a more favorable mix and price cost spread, realization of cost synergies and our rightsizing initiatives.","Looking forward now for Diversey Care, we believe that we will continue to deliver strong performance in developing regions, albeit at a slower pace due to currency devaluations in many of these countries relative to 2013 and see more stability throughout Europe. As it relates to our strategy for Europe, we will continue to focus on bottom line improvements and eliminate business that is not aligned with our profit expectations. Our growth in North America will be driven by our ability to successfully execute on our targeted growth strategy. I want to reiterate what we said last quarter, which is that we are very focused on improving the earnings or quality of this division, including the ongoing cost savings initiatives and eliminating customer and portfolio bleeders.","Turning to Slide 9. Product Care delivered 5% constant currency sales growth with 5% growth in North America and approximately 2% growth in Europe. We had a mid-single-digit growth in the U.K. and Italy and Germany was essentially flat, but France declined by 2%. These year-over-year trends in Europe are an improvement from last quarter again. We are encouraging, but we are -- but at the very same time, the recovery is slow and we are planning appropriately.","In terms of pricing and product mix, I am pleased to report a positive impact of 1.7% in the quarter on a global basis. This is a direct result of our decision to hold firm on pricing, walk away from low-margin businesses and focus on growing our packaging systems and cushioning business, which is benefiting from our focus on the e-commerce market. I also want to point out that U.S. Product Care delivered 3% in favorable pricing in the quarter despite our price increases being effective as of November 1. And I'm very pleased with this performance and reaffirm our resolve as we face new resin and raw material increases in the first quarter.","The decline in adjusted EBITDA margin on a year-over-year basis for the year was primarily due to raw material costs increases not fully offset by price increases and favorable product mix and higher supply chain cost. This suggests that we still have a lot of opportunity to improve on each of the items that I just mentioned.","And now, I'll turn over the call to Carol, to provide additional comments in the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2014.","Carol P. Lowe","Thank you, Jerome, and good morning, everyone. If you are following along with our presentation, Slide 10 provides a bridge for net sales growth on a year-over-year basis for the quarter and full year. We delivered 3% growth in the fourth quarter and 2% growth for the full year. Currency had a 1% unfavorable impact on the quarter and full year 2013, primarily due to declines in Latin American currencies, most notably in Argentina and Brazil. For the quarter, volumes contributed $27 million and price\/mix was $52 million positive, driven by favorable trends in all divisions and in all regions. For the year, volumes contributed $114 million and price\/mix was $94 million positive, primarily due to favorable trends for Food Care and Diversey Care.","Slide 11, just like the adjusted EBITDA bridge, excluding SARs, for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, for the quarter, adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat compared to last year. Favorable mix and price cost spread of $26 million and cost synergies of $28 million were largely offset by $31 million in unfavorable supply chain cost and $17 million in performance-based compensation. The unfavorable supply chain costs were primarily related to $12 million of nonmaterial inflation, $8 million of LIFO adjustments and $4 million for timing of inventory adjustments. We recorded additional performance-based compensation of $17 million in the fourth quarter. This is in recognition of our strong year-over-year performance for the full year 2013 in the areas of adjusted EBITDA, working capital management and other key financial metrics.","For the year, adjusted EBITDA, excluding SARs, increased to $1.07 billion from $1 billion in 2012. The 7% increase in EBITDA was attributable to $112 million of cost synergies, $41 million of favorable mix and price cost spread and $40 million in volume. These increases were partially offset by $25 million in performance-based compensation, $34 million in selling, general and administrative expenses and $61 million in the Other category you see on the bridge. The Other category includes $46 million of unfavorable supply chain cost primarily related to nonmaterial inflation. As a reminder, we have previously communicated that our annual salary, wage and benefit inflation is approximately $55 million to $60 million. The increase in SG&A expense and approximately $25 million of the unfavorable supply chain costs are related to this compensation inflation.","In 2013, SARs expense was $38 million, as compared to $18 million in 2012. As of December 31, we have 1.3 million SARs outstanding, which compares to 1.9 million I shared with you on the October earnings call for Q3. Of the 1.3 million SARs outstanding, 800,000 are unvested. In 2014, 500,000 will vest with the remaining 300,000 vesting in the first quarter of 2015. Based on our recent experience, we expect SARs to be exercised within a few months of their vesting date.","Now, turning to Slide 12. We generated $509 million of free cash flow, a $238 million improvement over 2012. As Jerome indicated earlier, we put forth a tremendous effort in the last few months of the year to accelerate cash generation in preparation of the Grace Settlement. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow is primarily due to higher net earnings and significant net working capital improvements. We made meaningful progress on collection of customer past dues and we reduced our day sales outstanding by more than 3 days. We also reduced our days on hand inventory by 4 days and increased our days payable by 2 days. Our simple working capital, as a percent of net trade sales, improved from 19% at the end of 2012 to 17% at the end of 2013. We are confident that we can not only maintain this improvement, but can continue to leverage improvements in our investment in working capital.","Cash restructuring payments were $107 million in 2013, which was less than the $140 million we guided to in our October conference call. As we have shared in the past, timing of execution of certain restructuring activities can be uncertain especially in Europe. Our CapEx in 2013 was $116 million, compared to $123 million in 2012. SARs cash payments totaled $46 million for the full year 2013, as compared with $24 million in the prior year. Looking forward, our primary use for free cash flow generation continues to be focused on reducing leverage.","Our outlook for the full year 2014 is summarized on Slide 13. Net sales are expected to be approximately $7.7 billion, with organic growth of approximately 3% to 4%, which is due to positive trends in both price and volume. This will be offset by product rationalization of approximately 1% to 2% and an estimated unfavorable impact of more than 2% from foreign currency translation.","Going forward, we will provide our outlook with a few changes from past practices. For adjusted EBITDA, we will include the noncash profit-sharing expense in our guidance, as it is an actual expense for the company and it's estimated to be approximately $40 million in 2014. Additionally, we are providing guidance for adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share excluding the impact of SARs. We anticipate adjusted EBITDA, excluding SARs and including profit-sharing expense, to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion. This compares to $1.038 billion in 2013 or an increase of 1% to 3% on flat top line. We expect adjusted EBITDA to improve in each of our 3 core divisions.","We expect depreciation and amortization to increase to approximately $315 million from $307 million in 2013. This increase is due primarily to bringing our long-term incentive compensation in line with market. We are committed to align our employees with our shareholders and this includes providing market-competitive share-based compensation.","Now that Grace is behind us, we estimate interest expense to be approximately $295 million. The core tax rate for 2014 is expected to be approximately 25%. We estimate adjusted earnings per share, excluding SARs, to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60, an increase of 8% to 15%, as compared to 2013 adjusted earnings per share of $1.39, also excluding SARs. Please note that our guidance for earnings per share has always been net of profit-sharing expense.","Now, let's turn to our guidance for free cash flow. We anticipate 2014 free cash flow to be approximately $410 million. CapEx is estimated at $170 million. Our restructuring payments are estimated at $150 million. We expect cash interest to be approximately $280 million. Cash taxes are estimated at approximately $100 million.","To wrap up, I want to say that we made a lot of progress in our financial performance and disciplines in 2013. The entire company is committed to continuous improvement and we very much look forward to the year ahead.","And now, operator, can you please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two-part...","[Technical Difficulty]","Lori Chaitman","Operator, if need be, you could move to the next question, then we can go back to George.","Operator","Next question then comes from the line of Alex Ovshey, who is from Goldman Sachs.","Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Usha Guntupalli on behalf of Alex. A quick question on the pricing growth. Could you remind us how much pricing growth is factored in your 2014 EBITDA guidance?","Carol P. Lowe","So, what -- the amount we gave for the organic growth, it's slightly more on pricing than it is on volume, but we will benefit top line for both price as well as volume. But again, that's being offset by currency, negative currency impact, as well as very intended product, customer and geographical rationalization to improve the quality of the business. So again, we said 3% to 4% organic growth with that more heavily weighted on pricing.","Usha Chundru Guntupalli - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And is your target to mostly offset resin inflation? Or is your target to get pricing over and above resin inflation?","Carol P. Lowe","The minimum is resin inflation, but we also have inflation above just our resin cost. We have other nonmaterial inflation, whether it's utilities and things like that. And our expectation is to be more than whole, so that we see margin expansion. Jerome, I don't know if...","Jerome A. Peribere","So let me repeat what I said 1 year ago and not wavering an inch on this. We have, in Sealed Air, we have a very clear and determined left brain and a very clear and determined right brain. The left brain is about discipline and Get Fit. A very clear element of the Get Fit component is to start by recouping our cost increases. And you heard in my prepared remarks that we have not been very successful in Q1 and Q2 with our price increases compared to our cost increases. Remember that in the U.S., resin prices went up by $0.12 in January of last year. And we have implemented those cost increases, but -- those price increases, but not fully. I was dissatisfied toward the year as to the rate of implementation. And I must clearly say that I was quite happy with our result, determination and the systems that we have put in place with regards to our October announcement effective November 1. And there is -- there's all kinds of things, including a cultural change that we needed to make sure was happening in our various markets. And I must admit that our people saw that it was possible and we're not here in the business of absorbing those costs. So we need to make sure that our people start by understanding that very clearly that we are not in the business of absorbing it completely or partially. And for 2014, we're going to continue to raise this. The resin suppliers have announced $0.04 for February. There's a very large supplier who has announced a $0.06 for March and we're not going to be waiting. You're going to see very soon that we are announcing officially price increases to cover for those costs because we can do that. So that's the left brain, or that's the part of our Get Fit, which belongs to the left brain. The right brain is about changing the game. And this is where we are also determined to improve and change our go-to-market strategy where we are going to -- or in where we're starting to make progress in charging our customers for the value that we create. That is if you have attended our Investor Day in September, you saw 2 arrows. There was a dark one starting very dark and lightening up with our Get Fit because we will have achieved the discipline, the cost control, et cetera, et cetera, over the years. And there's another arrow, which was starting light in the shade and going darker and darker in -- for our Change The Game. This means that as we become very, very focused industry by industry, as we're here to add value to our customers, we are then going to be able to charge for the value we create. If you want just one example, in the meats business, I was last week at a conference with a very large meat producer. And I told him that in essence, we are in the business of helping them value their meat more expensive. This goes to better shelf life, to better hygiene, to improved packaging. That's what we are in the business of. And they say, \"If you can do that, we're onboard.\" We're onboard because we are going to make sure that we are going to be -- that as we add value to them, we're going to be able to add value to ourselves.","Operator","Your next question is now from George Staphos of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm not sure what happened before with the transmission, but thanks for getting me in the queue. Real -- just brass tacks kind of question here in 2 parts. You, I think, said your adjusted earnings pre-SARs is $1.39 for the year that just passed. I think in the past, the benefit of Grace would be something in the low teens from an earnings per share standpoint and realizing that's a full year number, but we'll use it to start. If I just add the 2 together, I get in to the low end of your guidance range for the year. And","[Audio Gap]","Carol P. Lowe","the low end. We will have benefit on cost savings that were estimating additional synergy costs. Those, we have factored in approximately $80 million that will benefit in 2014. However, a lot of that is utilized by that $55 million to $60 million in annual inflationary costs that we see. Now, a lot of you would say, \"Carol, you told us last year, it was $55 million to $60 million. Why is it still $55 million to $60 million when we've had headcount reductions?\" One of the challenges that we faced is that we do have a pretty large employee base and some highly inflationary economy specifically in Latin America. And that has created a drag where we're not realizing quite as much of a reduction in that annual compensation increase. What our forecast represents in total is we've conducted a very detailed bottom-up forecast that our divisions have put together, they believe in, they have high confidence in. We've always said that this new management team for Sealed Air, we're going to be very prudent","[Audio Gap]","...in our expectations. Please rest assured, we clearly have internal stretch goals, but what we're presenting to you today is something we feel very confident about.","Jerome A. Peribere","So let me add just a little bit of","[Audio Gap]","Operator","Next question is from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.","Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just given the increase in Europe from a volume perspective, understanding that comps are easy. Jerome, should we start to expect that the next leg of pricing for the company starts to focus on that region? I assume that raw material prices could start to book higher if the recovery there is sustainable.","Jerome A. Peribere","So, Ghansham, good to hear from you. The pricing -- the cost raw materials increases right now are fairly widespread but depending on the region and depending on the raw material. Benzene prices have gone -- have been shooting very high and this is affecting MDI and this is affecting the propylene chain. So our Instapak business is affected and we are announcing price increases. We have announced price increases in Europe. And we are announcing price increases in North America to that effect. The polyolefin business prices are mostly coming from -- in North America and the market is somewhat softer in Europe. But we also have announced some price increases in our films and polyethylene-based products. Bearing in mind also, there are some price increases affecting the nylon base. So the reality is that the raw materials are increasing in different areas at different levels, but what has been a very clear trend is that the benzene prices have been very firm, and this is -- and therefore, we need to react quickly in that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","At your Analyst Day in September, you guided to 2016 sales of, I think roughly, $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. And when I think about sales guidance for 2014 being basically flat and that top line growth guidance maybe being back-end loaded to 2015, 2016, I'm just wondering how we should think about that. Is 2014 just really impacted by the FX headwinds? Or are you expecting some sort of contribution from emerging markets or a price that you expect to really accelerate in 2015, 2016?","Jerome A. Peribere","So 2 points here. One is that you need to compare at equal, equal","[Audio Gap]","is that I would have done faster in 2013 in retrospect is go stronger at the low-quality businesses. We need to continue and we will this year continue to streamline for bleeders or for low-return customers. This is applying to every single of our product line in every single of our 3 divisions. So I am -- I want growth, but I don't -- I first want quality growth. And to have quality growth, you need first to have a streamlined and clean portfolio. And that's going to continue in 2014, which is affecting our top line growth in general. So we really take at heart this Get Fit. We're taking it very, very seriously because it is our disciplined approach, which is going to make a different company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Question on working capital, or maybe 2 related questions on it. The first is it looks like you took a really serious push on working capital, especially in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering on the inventory side or the inventory reduction side, if that reduction had any operating issues or resulted in any operating issues, or maybe you didn't run at optimal rates across your normal platform and if that had any impact on, say, the margins? And then just as a follow-up, how should we think about working capital improvements and the potential for that in 2014? Because it did seem like you had some really, really big improvements in the fourth quarter in 2013 overall.","Carol P. Lowe","John, great questions. In terms of unabsorbed overhead, which is what we would have experienced if we had a lot of inefficiencies, in total for the company, no, on a collective basis, we did not. The negative impact that we did see is the LIFO adjustment that I referenced, because it spoke specifically for our Product Care business, as we reduced some inventory levels and because of the way LIFO works, we ate back into levels as far back as a basis to 1994. And because of that, we had that LIFO -- negative LIFO impact. So that's really the main obvious thing that we saw. We're very confident about our ability to continue to monetize working capital to create good cash flow for the company. One thing we were able to push really hard on the last couple of months of the year was accelerating collection of past dues. We've shared publicly in Q3 that our past dues were approximately $200 million. We still have $160 million of past dues. So we still have opportunity. Our cash flow that we're forecasting, if you do the walk, you'll see that the primary difference going from the $509 million for 2013 to the $410 million that we're forecasting -- for 2013, $410 million for 2014, is driven by the increase in restructuring charges to $150 million, as well as the increase in CapEx. So those are the 2 primary drivers for the decrease. We do believe we have additional opportunity in working capital and that will be part of our stretch goal internally.","Jerome A. Peribere","So remember what short-term incentive compensation is based for our people. It's based on EBITDA and we almost reached our objective there; on productivity improvement, which is measured as expense to gross profit; and on working capital as a percentage of net sales too. As Carol said in the prepared remarks, we have improved 200 basis points, from 19% to 17%, and we're going to continue to improve. We can do that. Have we put a very strong stretch goal in Q4 internally? The answer is yes. And it is yes because the Grace settlement was coming and we wanted to come with a lower debt situation. So there's been a very strong push. But we are organizing this improvement, and our internal goal for this working capital to net sales is to improve over 17%. And that's a pretty nice thing. You mentioned also the quality of our business in Q4. At the end of the day, there are 2 things which have affected our cost base there. Number one is that our incentive compensation in 2012 was slightly below 70% for the incentive compensation was paid at slightly below 70%. And in 2013, it has been very slightly above 100%, so there's been some catch-up and which generated $17 million in there. And then the elements of inventory reduction and all of those things have played a small part in it also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Josephson of KeyBanc.","Adam J. Josephson - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Back to -- a follow-up on George's question earlier about your guidance. So EBITDA was up about 8% last year. You're guiding to up about 2% this year. And I just want to make sure I understand the puts and takes. FX was about a 1% drag on sales last year. This year, it will be 1% to 2%. $30 million lower cost savings this year compared to last year. And anything in terms of price over costs that you're assuming in '14?","Carol P. Lowe","So that -- Adam, the currency impact is actually more than 2%, not 1% to 2%, on the top line and the impact on the bottom line on the EBITDA as well. We do -- we -- again, I reference the salary and comp and benefit inflation. We obviously have expansion in margin, which is what we're forecasting. We do have to have positive mix and price cost spread and that's factored in our EBITDA as well. And I also -- I talked about the approximately $80 million in cost synergies and we'll also have volume growth that will positively impact. But we will have, in addition to the salary labor wages and benefit cost increases, we will have some other nonmaterial inflationary costs also.","Jerome A. Peribere","So you see, the currency thing here will depend on, at the end of the day, altogether, as to what the euro is doing. We had an Australian Dollar, peso or real or Canadian dollar and a U.K. pound devaluation in 2013 compared to 2012, but this has been partially offset by a slight strengthening of the euro when you compare to '12 and '13. We are -- you have seen all of these emerging countries devaluation happen in the last 4 to 5 weeks or even less than that, but we don't anticipate that the euro is going to revalue compared to the U.S. dollar. And therefore, we are a little bit prudent in that sense. What are we doing? Well, in the emerging countries where we can move to -- when we can move to dollar base, we're moving to dollar base. And In several countries in Latin America, we're moving to dollar-based pricing. And when we can't move to officially dollar-based pricing, we are implementing major price increases. This is what has happened in Q4, in our Brazilian market, for example where we went for major, major price increases in real in order to offset this kind of situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Al Kabili of Macquarie.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Just wanted to clarify, Carol, on the '14 outlook, how you're thinking about pension expense. Because I would think that's a tailwind there. And so with the tailwind, I'm trying to understand what other offset might be to that.","Carol P. Lowe","Okay, so Al, I'm going to look real quick, I don't have the number right in front of me. But it's pretty much in line. It was a -- just not even a noticeable increase when we put together our 2014 plan.","Lori Chaitman","Do you have another question, Al?","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Pension expense is going to be flattish. And then are you -- and then as far as incentive comp, which was a big headwind in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about incentive comp '14 versus '13? Is that -- a headwind, flattish on the base guidance?","Carol P. Lowe","So if we perform the plan, which we've shared with you, it would be flat because we were just slightly above 100% payout factor for 2013 and we would -- we expect and plan to be no less than 100%. So in terms of the numbers we've shared with you, it would be about flat.","Albert T. Kabili - Macquarie Research","Okay. And target is -- and the target comp -- incentive comp, the target bogey is the EBITDA that you communicated...","Jerome A. Peribere","We don't normally give that.","Carol P. Lowe","Our plan that we've communicated in the past, it's weighted, a portion on EBITDA and as Jerome talked about, a portion on working capital improvement and a portion on a support expense as compared to gross profit. So...","Jerome A. Peribere","So we're going to keep having these same 3 criteria, which are EBITDA to our internal plan, which is -- and then, our productivity improvements as measured by expense to gross profit ratios and our working capital as a percentage of net sales improvements. Same criteria as last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Manuel of Wells Fargo.","Christopher D. Manuel - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I kind of want to come back to the same -- because I'm still, I think, missing a couple of elements when I think about the EBITDA bridge '13 to '14. If I started the $1.04 billion that you did this year and I look at the movement to next year, it's kind of in that $12 million to $32 million of higher EBITDA. And if I start from the earlier comment you made that price would be more of a component of the organic revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, if you have a couple points of price within there, that could be upwards of $150 million of improvement. The $80 million of cost savings, I get something that should be in the kind of low mid-200s is where you could improve. And I recognize you had the offsets of -- you've talked about $60 million of inflation, et cetera. But there's still, Carol, seems to be a gap that I'm having a difficulty bridging. Can you maybe give us that...","Carol P. Lowe","I think you're a little high on the mix and price cost spread that you're looking at.","Jerome A. Peribere","One thing is the price. The other thing is price cost spread.","Carol P. Lowe","Yes, because it has to fall down...","Jerome A. Peribere","We are anticipating some cost increases again for resins and other type of raw materials. So that is the situation. So the first question in the Q&A was about margin expansion and, one, is pricing discipline to recoup our cost increases; number two is margin expansions through what I talked about. So we are anticipating price, but not very much margin expansion. That's one. The second thing is that you have seen that we are talking about product rationalization. And in product rationalization, you are -- we're going to be weeding some product lines or some products. And as a result of that, our overall volume projection is not very large.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gaffner of Barclays.","Scott L. Gaffner - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just going back to the guidance here for a minute. If I look at the EBITDA growth year-over-year on a percentage basis, it looks like your -- you think you'll grow at about 30 basis points year-over-year. But if you continue to do that in 2015 and 2016, it does look like you'll come up short of the 14.5% to 15.3% EBITDA margin that you outlined for 2015.","Carol P. Lowe","So one thing, Scott, and it's a good point, but remember, we have $150 million in restructuring items that we're looking at that we'll start getting additional benefit for that as we move forward. And we haven't realized all of that benefit at this point. We continue -- we'll have $80 million. We'll have additional benefit as we move forward in 2015 and 2016. That will also help us. But we -- we're very confident in the 2016 numbers that we've provided. There's -- we wouldn't back off of those at all from a margin standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli.","Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.","If we look at the debt repayment, Carol, you paid down about $400 million in 2013. Could you give us a feel for how much you expect to pay -- to repay in 2014? And the timing of the cash going into Grace's asbestos fund, as well as the tax credit in 2014.","Carol P. Lowe","So we -- the timing was that we actually funded on Monday. So that's -- this past Monday, that's when the funding went in for the Grace settlement. We have $150 million for the 12% bonds that are outstanding that we'll pay middle of this month, actually on February 14. So we'll make that payment. With the cash flow generation, the free cash flow of $410 million, again, principally, all of that will be utilized to reduce debt. So it will be around that $400 million that we'll reduce debt in 2014. As it relates to the tax refund, that actually will come in 2015, because we made the payment in 2014. It will be based when we file our 2014 tax return in early 2015 and we will get more than $200 million in 2015 that we'll also use for leverage reduction.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of analyst Chip Dillon.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","A couple of questions, actually to follow up on that one on the tax benefits. If you look at the total value of the -- what you gave, $200 million would be certainly well below the corporate tax rate of 35%. So I'm kind of wondering, are there other sort of less visible benefits, whether you're paying less in estimated taxes in '14 or less in cash taxes than you otherwise would? And then on a separate basis, there was a great rundown on the SARs. And it would seem like this year, let's say 800,000 were actually exercised. Would that be roughly about a $40 million guesstimate as to what that number could be for this year?","Carol P. Lowe","So, Chip, as it relates to the taxes -- and we've said it's more than $200 million, part of the challenges we have -- in terms of carrying -- how much we'll carry back versus carry forward, we have to take into consideration where we're at on certain foreign tax credits, how those have been treated. And our tax department does a phenomenal job of making sure they get the most benefit for us that they can. So as we move forward and when we file the 2014 return, they'll look at our position for all of those. So that's why we're saying more than $200 million. We've previously communicated it could be up to $250 million. Again, it's going to depend on our position on other tax credits and certain tax initiatives. With respect to the 25% tax rate that we're guiding to for 2014 versus where we're for the 22% for 2013, one thing that's impacting that right now is that the U.S. Congress has not approved certain things such as R&D credit and look-throughs for intercompany transactions. We expect them to go back and do that retroactive. But right now, we have no assurances, so that's also negatively impacting our core tax rate that we're presenting. So you see a little bit of that happening as well. And then the second part of the question, remind me, Chip, again, what you were asking, I'm sorry. I got going on taxes so much, I forgot the second part.","Lori Chaitman","Operator, can you unmute Chip please?","Carol P. Lowe","Right. Okay, we'll put you back in the queue. My apologies.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Credit Suisse.","John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Just one follow-up question on the shares that you're transferring over as part of the -- or transferred over as part of the settlement or trust with Grace. Is there any lock-up period on those, or can those hit the market at any specific point? Are there any restrictions on how quickly those can be transferred out of the trust? Can you give us some color on that?","Carol P. Lowe","So John, it's 90 days -- 60 days, I'm sorry, that there'll be a lock-up on that. They have to be registered and everything. So we -- they've transferred and issued and they've always been in our outstanding share count. So it's not a negative impact from that standpoint, but it will be 60 days.","Operator","We now have Chip Dillon again.","Lori Chaitman","Sorry, about that Chip.","Carol P. Lowe","All right, Chip...","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","No worries at all. It was great, the rundown on the SARs and it looks like that's going to be finally behind you in 1 year or so. But I think you mentioned, Carol, that about 800,000 would likely vest this year. And if we guessed -- is the way to kind of think about it is where we just sort of take that number, if they were all exercised and multiplied times the stock price? Or just kind of remind us. Because of I did that, I would get to about $40 million in expense this year.","Carol P. Lowe","Yes. So it wouldn't be expense. That would be -- your math is correct, but that's the cash impact because they are converted to cash when they're exercised. They don't actually get Sealed Air equity, it's cash settled. The expense is already recorded up to the current stock value. There is a slight discounting we do for any unvested shares because some shares end up being forfeited if people leave and what have you. But generally, the way to think about it is whatever shares are there for the SARs, it's the change in the share price that impacts our expense.","Operator","Your next question comes from investor Scott Hendricks [ph].","Unknown Attendee","The strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet de-leveraging gives you more options for capital allocation over the coming years. My question is, with shares trading at a low teens multiple on cash EPS, how do you weigh buybacks versus dividends versus further de-leveraging, both philosophically and in terms of the timing?","Jerome A. Peribere","So priority number one is de-leveraging. And when we will achieve the ratios we have talked about previously, then we -- then the board will decide how much of share buyback and how much of dividend distribution.","Carol P. Lowe","And as a reminder, it's about 3.5x to 4x that we feel comfortable that we would be able to look at options to return value to shareholders.","Operator","Do you have time for one more question?","Lori Chaitman","No. Operator, we're going to move to Jerome closing out, please.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for that. Thank you for your questions. I know hand over the call to Jerome Peribere for the closing remarks.","Jerome A. Peribere","Well, thank you very much to all for your very active and very insightful questions. I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers and our shareholders for their ongoing support. I would also like to thank our employees around the world for their commitment to improving the operating and financial performance of Sealed Air. And the progress that we made in 2013 was no short of being remarkable, but there's still a lot of work to be done.","Confident that our plan to improve Sealed Air's quality of earning is well underway and we expect to see continuous improvement throughout 2014 and the future years. 2013 performance is a true testament to our leadership team and their commitments, with very clear direction for our business. And we are very confident that we have the right strategy in place, focused on providing significant value and innovative solutions to our customers, becoming more nimble and, in the end, creating a better way for life.","We look forward to speaking with you on our next meeting call, currently planned for April 30 of this year. Thank you so much and have a great day. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you."]}}
