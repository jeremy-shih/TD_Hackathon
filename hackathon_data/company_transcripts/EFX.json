At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Trevor Burns. Please go ahead.","Trevor Burns - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including fourth quarter and full-year guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the third quarter of 2018, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets.","Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incidents, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance technology and data security.","This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as our projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security are expected to occur throughout 2018, 2019 and into 2020.","Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes the cost related to the agreement in principle to settle class action lawsuits related to reporting a civil judgments and tax claims on our credit files.","We reported a charge of $18.5 million in the third quarter with an adjusted EPS impact at about $11.50 per share. Details of this agreement will also be included in our third quarter 10-Q.","Adjusted EBITDA is also defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization; income tax expense; and also as the case for adjusted EPS, excluding certain one-time items including cost related to cybersecurity incident, cost related to the agreement and principle to settle class action lawsuits and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets.","These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In the Form 10-Q, which we will disclose that future losses from litigation and regulatory investigations associated with last year's cybersecurity incident are reasonably possible, but not yet estimable at this stage in the proceedings.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks, Trevor. Good morning. We continue to make positive steps in the third quarter towards returning to a normal selling relationship with our U.S. customers, while investing heavily in technology, security and customer support and transformational investments. Our significant multiyear investments in technology and data security are critical to our long-term success and will differentiate Equifax in the future.","Our financial performance in the quarter was solid as we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.41 per share which is at the midpoint of our range. Revenue for the quarter of $834 million reflects local currency revenue growth of 2%, which was consistent with the second quarter, but below our expectations and yours for revenue growth in the quarter. In excess of a-third of this revenue growth versus our expectation reflects the weaker-than-expected U.S. mortgage market as well as weaker credit markets in Australia and the well-known economic conditions in Argentina.","Importantly for us in the quarter, USIS posted positive revenue growth for the first time since the cybersecurity incident despite the weakness in the U.S. mortgage market. And equally important EWS growth approached to strong 9%, a really strong performance by both businesses as they continue to focus on the future.","Currency continues to be substantial headwind for our business, negatively impacting revenue by over 200 basis points and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04 a share versus third quarter 2017. Versus our expectations for the third quarter, currency negatively impacted revenue by about 50 basis points or $4 million and adjusted EPS by over $0.05.","USIS revenue was up slightly versus last year compared to the down 1% to 2% we saw in the last three quarters. This is a solid performance in a very positive step forward for our U.S. business as we work towards returning to a more normal growth mode with our customers.","We also saw growth in online information services, which was also up 1% versus last year. These are both really important milestones for us, which were achieved despite the mortgage market headwind, where inquiries were down over 10% in the quarter, which negatively impacted overall U.S. revenue by 3%. So that positive performance with that headwind was a real positive for us.","While we show this momentum in sequential improvement the USIS revenue, the performance was below what we expected and John will provide some more details on that later in the discussion.","In the third quarter, the vast majority of our commercial relationships in the United States returned to more normal growth mode, which is allowing us to return to working collaboratively with our customers to pursue expanded and new solutions that will drive their business forward and create revenue opportunities for Equifax.","We have now a very small handful and I would say less than one hand of customers where we're still completing security reviews to address any remaining open items from the cybersecurity incident in 2017.","Our sales teams are successfully re-engaging and our pipelines are building in the U.S. However, as expected and as we discussed previously, sales cycles are extended and can be unpredictable. Sales cycles historically have range from 6 months and can be as long as 12 months including customer integration.","And as we discussed last quarter and prior quarters, these impacts on the sales cycles are having an impact on the pace of USIS' return to a more normal growth mode particularly in Financial Marketing Services. It will beat sales cycle impacts in the third quarter resulted in a 2% decline in Financial Marketing Services, which was weaker than our expectations as we had forecasted growth by that team.","Like in the third quarter, we saw a handful of contracts in that space that closed or are closing in October versus September, which is a reflection of the pace of this recovery and also the unpredictability of the business as we work through that recovery.","As in the third quarter, I'm continuing to spend a significant amount of my time with Paulino and his USIS team working with their customers as we return USIS to a more normal mode of commercial activity.","I met with over 30 U.S. customers in the last 90 days and will continue to spend a large portion of my time with our customers as we continue to return to a more normal growth mode. I was with a big customer in Texas last Friday and another big customer this week on Monday and our customers' perspectives are consistent and invaluable. They value our differentiated assets in the United States, they are supportive of our significant investments in technology and data security and they're ready to return and are returning to a more normal growth mode with us.","Our customers want to help them grow and they want to take advantage of our differentiated assets and insights. Our pipelines of new deals continue to build in the United States and are at their highest level in the past two years. Paulino and his team are aggressive and focused on driving growth, and we expect to see continued progress by USIS in the fourth quarter and in 2019.","Workforce Solutions had a very, very strong quarter with revenue up almost 9%. Importantly, verifications was up a strong 11%. Mortgage revenue was impacted by a 10% decline and this business also in the overall mortgage impact \u2013 mortgage market which negatively impacted their revenue growth by about 3 percentage points. So excluding the mortgage impact, you can see the strong growth that the Workforce Solutions team has outside of mortgage in the third quarter in other verticals and other markets as they expand their valuable assets.","Verifier revenue growth was broad-based with double-digit growth, across government talent solutions, auto, healthcare and cards reflecting their focus on expanding in the key strategic verticals.","Strong government growth at both the federal and state level was driven by demand for existing services and ramping of new products into that space. For example, several states are ramping a new eligibility product that bundles Workforce Solutions in USIS data that will benefit both businesses going forward.","Workforce Solutions has also benefited from strong double-digit growth in the FinTech space. While it's a smaller space for them today it's a growing vertical. FinTechs are looking to streamline online lending processes and simultaneously expand access to credit by leveraging our unique verified income and employment data to further differentiate their risk within subprime and near-prime lending segments.","These type of applications are a win-win for lenders and consumers, where lenders are able to further expand loan originations with sub and near-prime customer segments without taking on additional risk and a greater number of consumers are granted access to that credit.","In addition to the vertical strategy, the overall demand for The Work Number continues to grow as more verifiers establish automated system-to-system integrations that further embed our data deeply in their customer workflows and decisioning process. It also expands our relationships in FinTech that will benefit our renewed focus by USIS in this space.","The Work Number record growth was also strong. The team continues to execute on its strategy to identify or acquire new data contributors by targeting market through direct and partner channels. Through September, Workforce Solutions has added over 7,000 new employer contributors to The Work Number database and the vast majority of these to our partner channel program.","We expect Workforce Solutions focused on growing their database of work numbers to continue in the fourth quarter and into 2019. And as you all know this is a very important asset as that database grows.","Further, as we expected Employer Services return to revenue growth increasing 3% in the quarter, this was principally driven by growth in onboarding services. With consistent strong growth in Verification Services the return to growth for Employer Services and the continued growth of their database, we expect Workforce Solutions revenue growth to further accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue strong growth in 2019.","We continue to be energized about the performance of Workforce Solutions and the runway in front of them as they build-out their TWN database and expand into new verticals and use cases that will benefit from their unique employment and payroll database. Workforce Solutions is an important and strategic business to Equifax and is performing exceptionally well.","International had a good quarter with local currency revenue growth of 5%. Revenue growth was down from the 8% delivered in the first half of 2018 and our expectations principally reflecting the current economic situation in Argentina that's well-known and a weakening credit market in Australia.","We continue to see very strong performance across many of our international properties. Our Canadian business grew double-digits in local currency again in the third quarter which was a terrific performance.","Our Asia Pacific businesses despite the weakening economy had a strong quarter and our European credit business and our Latin American businesses all grew high single-digits in local currency.","As we discussed last quarter, our European debt management business is experiencing declines specifically in our venture with the UK government, which is partially offsetting the strength we're seeing across the rest of the International businesses. We expect the debt management business to return to growth in the fourth quarter and continue that performance as we move into 2019.","As John will discuss further, currency negatively impacted the international revenue \u2013 our International business by $18 million on the top-line or almost 8% in the third quarter and with a larger negative impact in the third quarter than we expected.","Our UK credit business which continues to deliver solid revenue growth is also delivering innovative products and partnerships to leverage future growth with UK open banking and open data relationships.","Our UK business partnered with a third-party to provide a large UK financial institution an affordability referral application based on the gateway decisioning and API capabilities of our new InterConnect platform. This application uses bank account information sourced through open banking to enable bank underwriters to view an applicant's bank statement, access affordability and verify their income. This streamlined customer journey reduces the application process length, improves customer service, reduces application fatigue and drop-offs and leads to more effective lending decisions for our partners, while adhering to the highest regulatory standards on an affordability assessment.","This solution is believed to be the first example of open banking \u2013 or we believe this to be the first solution of open banking being used on a credit application customer journey in the UK.","I'm excited about our International business and the collaborative innovation we are seeing from their global franchises. We expect continued strong performance from that team in the future.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue declined 12% on a reported and local currency basis in the third quarter. This was a little bit better than our expectations. As expected and as a result of our suspension of U.S. consumer advertising last fall, the U.S. consumer direct business revenue declined over 30% in the third quarter.","Our U.S. consumer direct business now represents just over 30% of GCS and our total consumer direct business including Canada and the UK represents slightly less than half of GCS revenue.","Our partner businesses, which are strategically important, which are sales through direct-to-consumer partner in benefits channels, represent slightly more than half of our revenue and were up double-digit in the third quarter. This growth was broad-based, fueled by growth from existing direct-to-consumer partners and the addition of new smaller partners and growth in our benefits channel.","As we discussed in our last call, the U.S. Senate passed legislation earlier in the year requiring credit bureaus to provide free services to consumers including free credit freezes. We fully supported the provisions of this legislation and our team successfully implemented these new services in September. Free credit freezes are now available via our website at www.equifax.com.","In September, we reopened the digital sales in our U.S. direct channel and GCS and began limited direct marketing to U.S. consumers in October. Initially, our level of marketing investment will be low as we test the market and we do not expect meaningful revenue growth in the fourth quarter from these marketing investments, but do expect to see positive revenue growth in 2019 from GCS on the direct-to-consumer side.","We believe retaining a direct relationship with consumers will be important to our commitment to substantially strengthen our customer support, as well as to our direct-to-consumer partner NPI efforts.","Turning now to our technology transformation. It's an important priority for us, which includes our actions to deliver on our commitment to become a leader in data security and our consumer support commitments. And these continue forward at a rapid pace.","Our new CTO, Bryson Koehler has been on the ground for three months and has hit the ground running. He's actively shaping our multiyear technology plan to bring our technology to market-leading and cloud capabilities. When fully implemented, this technology transformation is fundamental to not only our security and consumer support commitments, but also to delivering revenue acceleration and margin enhancement across Equifax.","We expect our multiyear technology investments to transform and differentiate Equifax in the marketplace. We made strong steps forward in the third quarter and will accelerate those efforts in the fourth quarter and into 2019.","In the fourth quarter, we'll continue implementation of our global data gateway decisioning and API framework applications that together we call InterConnect, following our virtual private cloud approach in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia, including Australia and India.","We'll also complete in the fourth quarter the implementation of our Ignite Direct in the virtual private cloud in a public cloud environment in Europe, in Latin America and Australia and new deployments of Ignite Direct in the U.S. and Canada following in the first quarter.","Existing U.S. and Canadian clients will be migrated to Ignite Direct throughout 2019. Ignite's marketplace will be deployed for all regions by the end of 2018 and will be a cloud native by the middle of 2019.","As you know, Ignite is a market-leading decisioning tool that allows customers to easily access Equifax's differentiated data, third-party data and their own data for modeling and decisioning.","We're also making great progress in integrating through Ignite and InterConnect our ability to manage attributes and models including those driven by machine learning from investigation to production. We expect to have implemented a seamless integrated process for a major U.S. customer in the fourth quarter and are working to make this broadly available by the end of the first quarter 2019. These investments and transitions will simplify and accelerate our consolidation of legacy platforms into modern cloud-based systems and substantially ease the ability of our customers to implement, access and utilize these applications and access our differentiated data.","The broader transformation of our architecture to a standard and consistent data fabric for data ingestion, governance, enrichment and management is also progressing well and we'll provide you more detail on our broader technology plan as a part of our fourth quarter earnings discussion in early 2019. All of these actions are being executed consistent with our commitment to be a leader in technology and data security.","Separately in the third quarter, we also informed eligible users of our free TrustedID Premier service that we are proactively extending that free service for an additional year. The product includes a suite of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. This proactive free product extension by Equifax is consistent with our ongoing commitment to consumers following last year's cybersecurity incident and is consistent with our commitment to be a leader in consumer support regarding personal credit information.","The costs associated with the acceleration of our technology transformation as well as the extension of the free credit and identity theft monitoring services are included in the one-time costs incurred in the third quarter and I'll give an update on that a little bit later as will John.","New product innovation continues to be a key priority for Equifax and a real Equifax strength. We have an active pipeline of new product innovation with over 100 new products at various stages in our funnel and are tracking to launch over 50 new products this year which is consistent with both 2016 and 2017 pace.","This growing pipeline of new products will be valuable in all of our markets, but particularly in the U.S. as they work back to a more normal growth mode. As with all years, success in delivering NPI revenue in 2018 and 2019 will be heavily based on sales of products launched in 2017 and 2016.","We are focused on protecting the technology, product management and marketing resources that work on NPI to ensure we keep that pipeline building and focused on bringing new products to market.","USIS is seeing an immediate success with several 2018 new products, including commercial trended data scores and also our identity validation products protecting against synthetic IDs in both batch and online environments.","Workforce Solutions working collaboratively with our USIS business is seeing success in extending Equifax identity validation products using the unique data maintained in the Workforce database through The Work Number and selected Employer Services applications. These solutions are utilized by government customers as well as providing opportunities for our commercial customers.","International has seen consistent strong execution in NPI throughout 2018, particularly the installation of new Ignite solutions across our major geographies. The International team is also developing a number of new data exchanges for industries such as telco, utility, insurance, which will enrich the solutions that we can offer through our global Ignite platforms. These new data exchanges are important long-term best by the business for the future in the markets that they're housed.","The addition of new data assets is integral to our strategy and provides long-term growth in those markets. These are in addition to the successes we are seeing in the UK integrating Equifax data with customer data through the new open data and banking \u2013 through the new open data and open banking initiative to deliver new solutions to customers.","Further, our GCS business through last year's acquisition of ID Watchdog is developing new financial wellness solutions for the benefits channel market. All of our business units are benefiting from the technology transformation, specifically the deployment of Ignite and its integration with InterConnect.","We are focused on making it easier for our customers to utilize Ignite both by increasing the D&A resources to working directly with customers and by implementing it in a virtual private cloud for easier access by our customers.","Getting our industry-leading Ignite platform and many of our experts in data science in the hands and working directly with our customers is an area of personal focus for me and Equifax more broadly. I'm confident this will accelerate NPI for Equifax as we finish the year and move into 2019.","We're also making some structural changes within Equifax, focusing on driving more of our resources and decision-making closer to customers. Over time, this will make us more responsive and reduce our overhead costs. We started making these changes in August with an organizational realignment of resources and decision-making closer to our market and customers and aligning those resources directly in our business units. We expect this to continue during the fourth quarter as we take a hard look at optimizing our G&A and headquarters cost structure across the business.","M&A remains an important avenue growth for Equifax. We have a solid pipeline of opportunities and have completed several small bolt-on acquisitions in 2018 supporting USIS, Workforce Solutions and International, including our acquisition of DataX that we announced in July.","In the third quarter, we also acquired an additional 10% ownership interest in our Indian joint venture bringing our overall ownership interest of 59%. We continue to see India as a long-term growth market for Equifax.","While M&A is core to our long-term strategy, we believe partner opportunities are also another avenue to deliver revenue growth. We recently entered into an important strategic partnership agreement with Yodlee, a financial data aggregation and data analytics platform provider to help simplify the mortgage loan process by making it easier for lenders to drive insights from borrower's financial data.","This collaboration provides Equifax with access to real-time asset expense and other information on prospective customers, who have granted permission and have streamlined a loan evaluation and production process for our customers, reduce broad exposure in the application process, get banks loan originators and lenders additional tools to assess risks and underwriting and portfolio management in the mortgage space.","As Trevor mentioned in his opening comments, our 10-Q will provide disclosure on the status of our litigation and regulatory and other investigations related to this 2017 cybersecurity incident, as well as other matters in which Equifax has involved. We continue to be responsive and work with all parties involved to address these matters in a timely and reasonable matter and we expect our discussion to continue to move forward positively in the fourth quarter and into early 2019.","I want to reiterate to consumers and to our customers of my absolute and Equifax's absolute commitment to protecting the sensitive consumer and customer data with which we've been entrusted, and to make Equifax a leader in data security and technology, while enhancing our customer support to make it the most friendly \u2013 consumer-friendly credit bureau. We made strong progress on these priorities over the last year and are committed to continuing to invest resources in people towards achieving these goals.","In summary, over the first nine months of 2018, Equifax has made strong progress on our strategic and tactical goals as we move past the cybersecurity incident in 2017 and move back to a more normal growth mode. We are confident we are moving in the right direction and that we have \u2013 and our momentum is accelerating as we approach the end of 2018 and Workforce to 2019.","We made important steps in the third quarter as we move back to a more normal growth mode in USIS and we expect this progress to continue as we move into fourth quarter in 2019. We're investing at record levels to make Equifax a market leader in data analytics technology and security and we're excited about our future and the opportunities that's ahead.","While our overall third quarter performance was below your expectations and ours, we delivered strong topline growth in Workforce Solutions, clear revenue performance in USIS and continued good performance in International. However, the level of improvement was less than we expected. Despite this, we delivered on our EPS commitment.","Before I turn it over to John, let me provide some further perspective on 2018 and how we're thinking about 2019. Looking at 2018, our largest BUs \u2013 the three Bus; USIS, Workforce Solutions and International, if you exclude GCS comprised 90% of Equifax revenue and delivered 4% local currency growth an improvement from first half and we're pleased with this performance.","Looking forward into 2019, we believe that we will see improved growth from each of our business units for the following reasons. First, we're confident that USIS is on a path back to growth. USIS is online business grew in the third quarter for the first time since the cybersecurity incident, despite a weaker-than-expected mortgage market. This is a really important milestone for us and step forward. While we've seen increased competitive pressures in USIS in the past 12 months, we've retained and extended key relationships our new deal pipelines are building strongly and as I mentioned earlier at the highest levels they've been in the last two years and we have a growing pipeline of new and innovative products to deliver to our U.S. customers. We feel good about the U.S. progress in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2019 as they work back to a more normal growth mode.","Our Workforce Solutions business is performing extremely well and has very strong fundamentals. The Verification business continues to grow its database strongly. We're penetrating existing and new verticals and expanding product offerings, which will provide strong double-digit growth. Employer Services returned to growth in the third quarter fueled by Employer Services. As we discussed earlier, we expect Workforce Solutions to have a strong fourth quarter and continue strong growth in 2019. This is an important and strategic business for Equifax.","Third, our International business has leadership positions in strategic global markets that enables us to bring new products and data access to markets. We expect the UK debt management business to return to growth in the fourth quarter and substantially improve in 2019 along with solid growth from our other International businesses.","And last, we all know that GCS was impacted significantly in the second half of this year by the lack of marketing over the past 12 months. We've restarted marketing in October in online sales and we're seeing continued growth in our indirect channel. These actions will result in significant improvement in GCS in 2019 and allow the business to move towards revenue growth in the second half of 2019. These dynamics of USIS returning to growth, the strong fundamentals of Workforce Solutions, International growth and the removal of the drag from GCS as they move back to a growth mode should allow for improved revenue growth as we move into and through 2019. This high-margin incremental revenue growth combined with our focus in the fourth quarter on cost efficiencies following our resource realignment in August should also positively impact our margins as we move into 2019.","Last, John will give you an update on our Sierra technology and security spend during his comments. Our 2018 spend is now forecasted $350 million, which is up $50 million from our prior forecast as we continue our security efforts and accelerate our technology refresh and cloud efforts.","We expect our spend to be significant again in 2019, but below this run rate. We continue to be energized about the future for Equifax and the investments we are making in the future.","With that, let me turn it over to John.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well.","For 2018, additional items excluded from our non-GAAP results are acquisition-related amortization expense, the one-time costs related to the cybersecurity incident, charges associated with an agreement in principles to settle class action lawsuits not associated with last year cybersecurity incident, income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting our settlement, the foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. We have provided the details on these items, so you can consider them in your analysis.","In total, in 3Q, 2018 we incurred total non-recurring costs of $136 million. The non-recurring charges are excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Included in these non-recurring costs were: non-recurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident of $117 million; $117 million of gross cost includes $16 million were generally for legal fees and other professional services principally related to outstanding litigation and government investigations related to the cybersecurity incident, $93 million were generally for one-time incremental project and other costs incurred to implement our data security and technology plan and improve our technology infrastructure and $8 million in accrued and incurred gross expenses related to the TID Premier service we offered free to all U.S. citizens.","As Mark indicated, we are expanding credit monitoring and identity protection services to eligible members for an additional year. Total non-recurring and one-time incremental project and other gross costs incurred year-to-date related to our technology and data security initiatives are $267 million, and since 3Q 2017 related to the cybersecurity incident are $431 million.","We have $125 million of cybersecurity insurance under our ENL (33:12) policy against which we have received payments to-date of $95 million. While we did not record any recoveries in the third quarter, we continue to expect to make claims that fully utilize the policy. The one-time incremental project cost for implementing data security and technology of $93 million in 3Q 2018 are up from 2Q 2018 and higher than the guidance we provided in July.","As Mark indicated earlier, our actions to substantially consolidate and transition our technology infrastructure, applications and data environments including aggressively moving to a virtual private cloud are accelerating rapidly.","In the second half of 2018 and early 2019, this is resulting in us incurring increased project costs to make needed investments in existing infrastructure as well as investing to build new infrastructure and consolidated applications in data platforms and begin the journey to migrate our global customers to this new infrastructure. We view the higher costs we're incurring over this period as short-term in nature. I'll provide more detail on our outlook for these costs later in the presentation.","In addition to the non-recurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident, we expensed $90 million related to an agreement in principle to settle class action lawsuits related to the reporting of civil judgments and tax liens on consumer credit files. For Equifax, in 3Q 2018 as Mark indicated revenue of $834 million is up 2% on a local currency basis and flat on a reported basis for 3Q 2017 and below the local currency expectation we discussed in July.","At the time of our conference call in July, our expectation was for local currency growth of over 4% with reported growth of over 2%. Actual FX impact in the third quarter was negative $18 million or 220 basis points and was more negative than expected by approximately 50 basis points or $4 million. This larger-than-expected impact was principally in our Argentina and Australia markets.","Local currency growth was less than expected by over 200 basis points. This weaker-than-expected performance was in USIS, International and also Workforce Solutions, market factors represented over a-third of this impact as USIS and Workforce were impacted by weaker U.S. mortgage market inquiries and International was impacted by weakening credit dynamics in Australia and the weaker current situation in Argentina.","I will provide details during my discussion of each view that follows. Adjusted EPS in the third quarter was $1.41 per share, reflecting weaker-than-expected FX in the quarter adjusted EPS would have been $1.42 per share above the midpoint of the $1.39 to $1.44 guidance we provided in July. Although our adjusted EPS came in as expected, this composition was different. The lower-than-expected revenue resulted in lower EBITDA dollars and margin percentage offsetting this was lower-than-expected corporate expense and a lower tax rate, as we will discuss later a portion of the lower tax rate we expect to continue.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33% in 3Q 2018 down 440 basis points from 3Q 2017. Just over half of the reduction in adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter of 2017 increased corporate costs, principally increased cost and security and related technology, our transformation and risk office, the cost of supporting Lock & Alert as well as increased insurance cost. These increases are consistent with what we described in our original guidance for 2018.","Corporate costs in 3Q 2018 are also reflecting increased variable compensation accruals relative to 2017. In 2017, following the cybersecurity incident, our incentive comp was eliminated for members of the senior leadership team and significantly reduced across the company. The remaining just under half of the decline was principally in USIS and International, which I will cover in more detail shortly.","USIS revenue in 3Q 2018 was $308 million up slightly compared to the third quarter of 2017 and importantly our first quarter of revenue growth since the cybersecurity incident. USIS delivered growth, despite a decline in the overall mortgage market inquiries of about 10%, which impacted USIS revenue growth negatively by over $9 million or 3%.","In the quarter, DataX \u2013 after DataX acquisition benefited revenue by about 1%. Mortgage Solutions and total USIS mortgage revenue related revenue were up 1%. Total mortgage-related revenue for Equifax including Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue was up 2%. Overall mortgage market inquiries declined by 10% more than a high single-digit decline we had expected. Equifax total mortgage revenue benefited from the launch of trended complete tribunal report in 1Q 2018. In 4Q 2018, we expect mortgage market inquires to be down over 10% higher than our estimate from July and down high single-digits for the full-year.","Online Information Solutions revenue was $222 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago period. Again, this growth was achieved despite the negative impact of the mortgage market of about 3%. We saw growth in both consumer online and commercial online revenues in the quarter. This is the first quarter of commercial revenue growth since transitioning to the CFN, reflecting the progress we are making in delivering new solutions to our commercial customers including commercial trended data.","Financial Marketing Services revenue was $47 million in 3Q 2018, down 2% or $1 million compared to 3Q 2017. The decline in Financial Marketing Services as Mark indicated is principally due to delays and longer cycle times on closing new batch opportunities. We continue to see the strengthening of our sales pipeline in USIS overall and our Financial Marketing Services. We expect to see that reflected in revenue performance as we move forward in 2019.","As I indicated earlier, USIS revenue growth was lower than we had expected in 3Q. Approximately a third of the lower USIS growth was driven by weaker-than-expected overall U.S. mortgage market. The weaker mortgage market and to a lesser extent some weaker auto online volume resulted in OIS revenue being up only 1%. Financial Marketing Services was also weaker-than-expected principally due to delay than longer cycle times and closing new batch opportunities as was indicated earlier.","The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 46.2% down 300 basis points from last year. Year-to-year USIS margins in 3Q 2018 were principally impacted by the following factors: increased third-party costs principally in mortgage and increased security-related and other technology costs.","We expect USIS 4Q 2018 revenue to be up versus 4Q 2017 and for calendar year 2018 revenue to be flat to down 1% from 2017. For 4Q 2018, we expect USIS EBITDA margins to improve sequentially.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $202 million in the quarter, up 9% when compared to 3Q 2017. Verification Services revenue of $144 million is up 11%, driven by strong double-digit percentage growth across government, auto, card, health care and talent solutions.","Mortgage was lower than our expectations due to the weakening overall mortgage market. This weaker mortgage market as well as some offline revenue that did not close in the quarter as expected, drove the bulk of the somewhat lower performance at Workforce against our expectations when the quarter began. Importantly, we also grew both active and total reference again in 3Q 2018.","Employer Services revenue of $58 million is up 3% in line with our expectations and better than the down 3% and down 9% we saw in 1Q and 2Q. As Mark indicated earlier, the increase was principally in our I-9 and onboarding businesses.","The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.5% in 3Q 2018 down 110 basis points from 3Q 2017. This decline was driven by increased production cost reflecting initiatives across our infrastructure and also increased cost of security.","Given the positive revenue mix driven by strong growth in Verification Services that we expect to continue in 4Q 2018, we expect to see sequential improvement in Workforce margins. For the full-year, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margins to be down slightly versus 2017.","International revenue was $235 million in 3Q 2018, down 2% on a reported basis and up 5% on a local currency basis. Asia Pacific revenue was $81 million, down 1% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. Growth is down from the 10% plus growth seen in the first half of 2018, consistent with the weakening we are seeing in consumer, particularly mortgage and other consumer credit markets in Australia. We continue to see nice growth in commercial.","Europe's revenue was $68 million in 3Q 2018, down 1% in U.S. dollars and flat in local currency. We continue to see high single-digit local currency growth in our European credit operations. This was offset by a local currency revenue decline in our debt management business specifically in our venture with the UK government.","As Mark mentioned earlier, we expect to see improved performance in the debt management business and a return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Latin America's revenue was $49 million in 3Q 2018, down 11% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. Revenue growth was weaker than the almost 15% growth we delivered in the first half of 2018, principally due to slower growth in Argentina which reflects the current economic situation there and slower growth in Chile which we believe is timing and we expect to see recover in fourth quarter. Similar to the first half of 2018, we continue to see good growth across Ecuador, Mexico, Uruguay and Paraguay.","Canada's revenue was $37 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currency. This was another great quarter for Canada, even stronger than the approximately 8% local currency growth they saw in the first half of 2018.","Canada's growth was broad-based including strong double-digit growth across decisions, solutions and analytical services. Investments in technology, including Ignite as well as a focus on customer innovation have resulted in strong growth with new FI and FinTech customers in volumes and fraud products.","International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.4% in 3Q 2018, down 380 basis points from 3Q 2017. The year-over-year decline reflects increased investment in sales generation as well as the expected increased spend in security and technology. We expect EBITDA margins to increase in 4Q 2018 as compared to 3Q 2018.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $89 million in 3Q 2018, down 12% on a reported and local currency basis. As Mark covered, our total consumer direct business comprising the U.S., UK and Canada represents just over half of GCS revenue. U.S. consumer direct revenue, which now represents just over 30% of GCS revenue in total, declined significantly in the quarter as we had suspended advertising and online sales in September of 2017.","We restarted U.S. online sales late in 3Q 2018 and have begun limited digital marketing earlier this month. As Mark indicated, we do not expect this to benefit subscriber levels until 2019.","Our UK consumer direct business is down due to price reductions related to GDPR but we have seen nice growth in subscribers which is positive as we move into 2019. Our partner-based businesses, which now represent over half of GCS revenue, grew nicely in the quarter and offset a portion of this decline. We saw a nice growth both with existing customers and added several smaller customers in the quarter.","ID Watchdog, the business Equifax acquired in 3Q 2018 that provides consumer credit and identity services through the employer benefits channel has been performing very well. We continue to see growth that we believe should accelerate in 2019 and 2020. We also believe this business has opportunities to expand into Canada, the UK and Australia.","GCS adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% in 3Q 2018, up 40 basis points from 3Q 2017. The net decline in revenue and related gross margin was more than offset by lower marketing expense in our U.S. consumer direct business and other admin costs.","In 4Q 2018, we expect a further sequential revenue decline reflecting a further decline in the U.S. consumer direct business and a resulting sequential reduction in EBITDA margins. 4Q 2018 EBITDA margins are expected to decline relative to 3Q 2018, reflecting both the lower U.S. consumer direct revenue and an increase in marketing expense as we restart U.S. consumer marketing.","In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $140 million. Excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the cybersecurity incident, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $68 million, up $22 million from 3Q 2017. The increase reflects two main factors.","First, the increased ongoing costs related to security and related technology, the free Lock & Alert product, our transformation and risk office and increased insurance costs. These increases are consistent with what we described in our original guidance for 2018.","Second, as I indicated earlier, corporate costs in 3Q 2018 are also reflecting increased variable compensation accruals relative to 2017. In 2017, following the cybersecurity incident, our incentive comp was eliminated for members of the senior leadership team and significantly reduced across the company.","For 3Q 2018, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was approximately 19%. In our 3Q 2018 guidance in July, we indicated that we expected our 3Q 2018 effective tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be lower than the 23.5% we had incurred in the second quarter. The 19% we incurred was slightly better than we had expected, reflecting both a reduction in our ongoing effective tax rate to 25% from the slightly higher rate incurred in 2Q 2018. In 3Q 2018, we had the benefit of this lower expected ongoing rate as well as the year-to-date catch-up. This lower rate will benefit us in 4Q 2018 and 2019. And we had discrete benefits in the quarter principally related to the annual return to accrual true-up.","The difference between our GAAP effective tax rate and the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS reflects adjustments for costs associated with our cybersecurity incident, litigation settlements not associated with the cybersecurity incident, the income tax effect of stock awards and foreign currency losses for re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included in our earnings release.","For 2018, we now expect our full-year effective tax rate including discrete items to be about 23.5% with 4Q 2018 slightly better than that level.","In 3Q 2018, operating cash flow was $153 million and free cash flow was $63 million. They're both down from 3Q 2017 principally reflecting the cash costs of our investments in security and technology and ongoing legal costs related to the cybersecurity incident. We also did not have any insurance cash collections in the quarter.","As we indicated earlier, we expect to fully claim on $125 million of cybersecurity insurance. To-date, we have collected $95 million in insurance with $80 million received in the first half of 2018.","Through September, operating cash flow was $507 million and free cash flow was $299 million, down 17% and 34% respectively.","Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $102 million and year-to-date was $250 million. Year-to-date capital spending is approximately 10% of revenues, slightly higher than we had expected at the beginning of 2018.","For all of 2018, we expect capital spending to be about 10% of revenue. Similar to our discussion related to project cost for security and technology transformation as we accelerate our progress in building new cloud-based infrastructure and then migrating existing applications to this new infrastructure, we're seeing higher project and therefore higher capital spending.","Total net debt at the end of 3Q 2018 was $2.4 billion. In September, we entered into a $1.1 billion 5-year revolving credit agreement that replaced our $900 million revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in November 2020. This new agreement is structured to allow flexibility over the next several years as we transform our security and technology infrastructure. We have now refinanced all near-term debt and credit facilities.","Now turning to our guidance for 4Q 2018. We are expecting local currency growth of 2% to 4% in 4Q 2018 as compared to 4Q 2017. At current exchange rates, FX is a negative 2.5% impact on revenue growth in 4Q 2018. This results in reported growth of down 0.5% to up 1.5% in 4Q 2018, while revenue between $835 million and $850 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.30 and $1.35 per share. Versus 4Q 2017, FX is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about $0.04 per share.","Our 4Q 2018 adjusted EPS guidance is down at the midpoint of our range and on an FX-adjusted basis by $0.03 from the 4Q 2017 adjusted EPS of $1.39. This decline is principally impacted by increased corporate expense of about $0.12 to $0.15. This increase is driven by two main factors. First, costs for security and related technology, the free Lock & Alert service, our transformation and risk office and increased insurance costs and increased variable compensation accruals relative to 2017, and also higher interest expense in 4Q 2018 of approximately $0.03 a share. These negative factors were partially offset by higher operating profit at USIS, Workforce and International partially offset by a reduction at GCS and a lower tax rate in 4Q 2018 as compared to prior year due to the 2017 Tax Act.","For perspective, since we provided our July guidance, FX has negatively impacted revenue by $4 million, $8 million and $12 million in 3Q 2018, 4Q 2018 and calendar year 2018 respectively. Adjusted EPS has been negatively impacted by $0.005 per share, $0.01 per share and $0.015 per share in 3Q 2018, 4Q 2018 and calendar 2018 respectively.","Looking at our guidance for calendar year 2018, we now expect revenue to increase on a local currency basis by 2.2% to 2.7%. At FX, at current rates is approximately 0.75% negative to revenue. This results in calendar year 2018 reported revenue guidance of $3.412 billion to $3.427 billion. Adjusted EPS guidance is $5.70 to $5.75 per share. FX is negative impact of $0.10 per share.","We expect in 2018 to incur in excess of $350 million of gross incremental cost for investments in technology and data security projects, and legal and professional fees being incurred just specifically to address litigation claims and governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident.","We continue \u2013 net costs after insurance proceeds are still expected to be approximately $275 million although timing of insurance receipts is difficult to forecast. Investments in technology and data security are expected to represent over 80% of the gross cost of \u2013 in excess of $350 million. These costs are being excluded from our non-GAAP financial results and guidance.","In 4Q 2018, we expect gross cost to be lower than what we incurred in 3Q 2018. These estimates do not include any estimates of damages, fines or other amounts that may result from the resolution of litigation and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. This represents an increase of over $75 million in gross cost from the original estimate of these gross costs that we provided in March. The increase is principally in technology investment and is occurring in the second half of 2018.","As was indicated earlier, as we begin the phase of building our new infrastructure based on our virtual private cloud approach and our transition of our applications of this new infrastructure we believe we are in a bubble period where we're incurring costs related to the needed investments in our existing infrastructure at the same time that we are moving to the new.","We are excited by this progress as we begin to more rapidly migrate applications to our future leading technology. These higher costs that I referenced are expected to be incurred in the second half of 2018 and early 2019. Beyond that, we will see a substantial reduction in technology in this year's spend. We will provide much more detail on our technology plans in our 4Q 2018 conference call early next year.","As Mark indicated earlier, we remain focused on delivering to our commitments in data security and consumer support. Over the past year, Equifax has made tremendous progress in delivering on the commitments made last year and moving our commercial relationships back to delivering new solutions for customers and opportunities to grow Equifax. However as expected, at times the progress is choppy, but we firmly believe the pace of change is accelerating and we are looking forward to the progress we will deliver in 2019.","And with that, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will take the first question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about USIS growth. You know, I know it was flat this quarter \u2013 first quarter positive post the breach. Just wanted to know \u2013 you are thinking of how quickly could this business return back to pre-breach levels? And also just in terms of the \u2013 still \u2013 lower level than where it has been since the breach. How much is it just the end market versus how much is reluctance from customers still trying to get comfortable with the security? Thanks.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Sure, thanks Toni for the question. I'll start and John can jump in. It's hard to forecast how quickly USIS over current return to kind of pre-breach growth levels of that 6%, 7%, 8% that it was doing 18 months ago.","We've been pretty clear that our recovery is positive. It's progressing. In my comments, I talked about that, you asked about that are there customers who don't want to do business with us. That's not the case. We've got less than a handful that \u2013 meaning one hand that we're still finalizing. Some of the security audits they're doing. The rest of our customers are back to more of a normal growth mode. Meaning, we're in there talking about competitive situations. We're in there talking about our NPIs. We're in there engaging around our Marketing Services business, our batch business.","So, we're back to a more normal growth mode. But that recovery is hard to predict at how quickly we're going to get into that normal growth mode. We've seen progress, which we're very pleased with. I talked about our pipelines continue to build with our customers. I'm spending a lot of time with them. They want to take advantage of our differentiated data, our new products whether it's Ignite or InterConnect or differentiated data and the NC-plus database our TWN, Work Number database.","Customer want our data and it's just going to be a matter of time. And we do expect continued improvement from third quarter to fourth quarter. We expect that we continue into 2019. It's just hard to predict when we'll actually get to that pre-breach growth level. But from my perspective, it's not a matter of if it's really just when and we expect that progress to continue.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then just on International. On a constant currency basis, LatAm and Asia Pac came in a little bit below where both have been in the last three quarters. And so, just wanted to get a sense of \u2013 I know you mentioned Argentina and Chile for LatAm. But anything to call out that could reaccelerate or any sort of one-time-ish type issues in 3Q that sort of made those a little bit slower?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Well, we talked about in our comments, right, that we thought Chile was a bit weaker in the third quarter, but we thought that was something that would recover as we got through the fourth quarter and into next year. So, Chile we do think is a short-term issue. Argentina, we'll have to see how the economy progresses.","And Australia, as we indicated, we are seeing some credit tightening there. You've seen some commentary recently by government officials and the Australian banks. So, there has been a credit tightening there and that's impacting our consumer business. But overall, that business continues to grow nicely with relatively high single-digit type of growth rates and we would expect them to continue to innovate as they have.","So as with all of our businesses, the ability to generate and sell new products is key to growth. And we think given the strong positions Argentina, Chile, generally in Latin America and Australia, we have that we should have the opportunity to do that as we move forward.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And one last quick one and then I'll turn it over. Mark you mentioned in prepared remarks, you expected litigation to move forward positively in fourth quarter and into 2019. Could you just elaborate on what you meant by that?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","I'm Sorry. I lost the first part of the positively forward in fourth quarter in 2019, which business?","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You expected litigation to move forward positively.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it really I was just trying to signal and actually not signal just be clear about it. We're in active dialogs with all parties involved in that. And those discussions are positive, meaning that we're engaging with them. And I'd say that they are at an accelerated pace. And we expect those to continue with that pace in the fourth quarter as we go into 2019 and are working towards resolutions to push those forward.","Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take the next question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. Just trying to square kind of the disappointment in 3Q with the positive commentary into 2019. And maybe some comments on how you're seeing the visibility of the business. I think you've talked about 6-months to 12-months sales cycle. Are you seeing those extended even further as you kind of reengage these customers post breach? And how we should think about sales cycle there?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, you're referring I think Greg to USIS there. As opposed to...","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, that's correct.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","...my comments were more broadly \u2013 we'll talk about USIS. I think our disappointment. We were pleased with USIS' progress. While it was a bit below what we had hoped for the fact that they move forward positively versus fourth quarter, first quarter, second quarter that sequential improvement was important to us and quite meaningful. And what's behind my comments and John's about our outlook for, as we go forward is you go back six months ago, nine months ago, even four months ago, we had a longer list of customers that were still completing their post security incident audits. That's a very small number now. As I said less than what you count on one hand. Meaning that we'll resolve those and we're back to normal discussions.","And our customers want our differentiated data. I'm spending tons of time with customers. I was with a big one on Monday, another big one last Friday. They want our differentiated data. They want our decisioning assets. So, they're engaged around getting back to growth. There is some unpredictability when you get the green light to get back in a mode of operations to be putting new products in front of them or new data assets, the unpredictability really comes about from them evaluating them, going through a purchasing process and there's a technology element of actually getting them those new products installed on their system or getting them access to our tools.","We don't see any extension of the sales cycle as we try to be consistent every quarter that these are different in every situation. But with the pipelines at the highest level they've been in USIS in the last couple of years, the momentum I see in the space the way our commercial teams are engaging with customers, my involvement, Paulino's involvement that's what gives us the confidence that USIS will see continued improvement.","And for your earlier question from Toni, we can't predict when we'll be back to that more normal growth mode. But we have a lot of confidence we're going to see continued improvement going forward. And as I said earlier, from our perspective, getting back to that more normal growth mode is not a matter of if, it's only timing. And we do expect to see continued improvement in fourth and then as we go into 2019.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","And looking at 2019, I think the commentary in general was just around \u2013 was looking at history right? I think we felt good about the fact that the three big businesses grew 4% on a local currency basis and actually improved their growth from the first half rate in the third quarter. And really a significant impact on our overall growth in the third quarter was GCS and the large decline there, which we think there's a very fairly clear path as to why that's going to substantially mitigate it again the next year. So, just based on what happened this year and what's fairly clear about GCS and the trends we're seeing, it feels like the trend is positive in terms of the type of growth rates that should occur.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe quickly on the organizational realignment. I think I heard it a couple times. Just any more color there and how you're thinking about the potential cost save opportunities from that process? Thanks.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. We're in the midst of that now. The alignment was made where we move to resources and reporting relationships back to the BUs and closer to the markets, which is an approach that I find makes a lot of sense to get decision-making closer to markets and customers. And we're going through a process now of a re-look at all of our cost efficiencies, as we do our budgeting for 2019 and we do expect some efficiency to come out and we'll be sharing those with you later in the year, for sure those will be quite visible as we have our discussion in January around our fourth quarter results.","Operator","We will now take the next question from George Mihalos from Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mark and John, you outlined a few factors that impacted the constant currency growth rate in 3Q going from sort of 4% to 2%. Can you just in order of magnitude break those out for us? I mean I guess mortgages is clearly the biggest that's almost a point. But, just maybe breakdown for us the different components that led to the slower growth? And has pricing with customers been a bigger impact recently than maybe a couple of quarters ago?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. So I think, George, it's really what we covered in the script, right. So, I think we indicated market factors which clearly by far the biggest is mortgage. We're about a-third of it. And then the remainder of it was non-market factors. And then we gave you the specifics really by BU, as to how BUs will specifically impact us. So, I just probably just need to refer you back to those to our overall comments to give you the breakdown of where revenue came in below expectation.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Was there anything sort of from a competitive angle or from a pricing angle that sort of stood out that maybe had a bit of a bigger impact than what you guys were expecting?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","No. No, there was nothing there on pricing competitive that was any different than our expectations in the quarter or frankly that we've seen during the year that would be different.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Just quick follow-up. Should we expect in conjunction with the 4Q earnings, should we expect you guys to kind of talk about your long-term targets and how you're thinking about the business going from there?","And then, Mark, you talked encouragingly about the trends going into 2019 both at the topline and even from a spent perspective? Should we be assuming that at least directionally margins will be up in 2019 versus what would you posted in 2018?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's early for us to give that kind of guidance on specific on margins. What we wanted to do is give you some visibility of things that we're working on in the fourth quarter. And you can do the math, with the revenue growth that we would hope to deliver in 2019 that should be helpful to margins. And cost actions that we're going to take and we don't have a sizing on that. Those should be positive for margins.","And with the long-term growth model, we haven't made a determination yet of the timing of putting that back in place. We'll certainly give some guidance for 2019 as we get into \u2013 finish up the year. And we're still thinking through the right timing to put that framework back in place.","I think we've tried to be consistent in our prior dialogs with you about the long-term guidance that we wanted to see some track record from USIS and that's building. So, I would say that, that's going in the right direction. But we wanted to see that continued growth from USIS, which we expect and that will be determined in that long-term framework.","And the second one is, is that, we want to have some visibility for us and for you around our legal settlements and those are still uncertain. And as I mentioned, we're in active dialogs with a lot of the parties, but there's still lots to discuss and lots to work on there. So those are kind of the two big ones.","And then the third would be around our Sierra spend, John mentioned that we've accelerated some spending in the second half of this year as Bryson's come on board and we're working through some of the rebuild and cloud initiatives, we don't have visibility yet on what this for 2019, I think we've been clear that it will be a significant number, but we wanted to give you some visibility that our expectation is it will be below the run rate that we're currently running at. But it'll still be a big number. It's going to be a multiyear effort and we try to be clear about that. I think those three points USIS, our legal settlements efforts and then our Sierra spend, getting those in a spot where we feel confident in discussing those with you would really be in front of putting our long-term framework back in place.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will now take the next question from Brett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning, Mark, John and Trevor. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress on USIS. I know it was a tough mortgage quarter but the underlying seemed really \u2013 getting better.","I have a question on the lower guidance and just want to make sure I understand the drivers of that. My understanding is you talked a little bit about a third of the 200 basis points, disappointment in rev growth was mortgage, maybe $4 million of ForEx and kind of the rest was the International, Australia and Argentina, as I understand it. The guide was a little bit lower than that disappointment. It's implying more pressure in the 4Q. Is the spread of kind of the headwinds in the 4Q going to be similar to maybe what we saw in the 3Q? Or is there anything else that maybe we need to be paying attention to?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","I think as we indicated, right, you're going to see more mortgage headwinds in the fourth quarter, as we think you're going to see the mortgage market be down more than 10%, which is greater than what we saw in the third quarter and you're going to continue to see the headwinds in Argentina, you'll continue to see the headwinds in Australia.","So, I think the things generally impacting the business overall aren't substantially different. But we are expecting to continue to make, as Mark has said, good progress with USIS, continue to make good progress in EWS. And we do think there are some positives that should occur on International. Again, the debt management business, we would expect it to turn positive or at least flat in the fourth quarter as we wrap around the difficulties we had with the UK government contract which started in the fourth quarter of last year. Then also, we expect to see some better performance out of Latin America. So, net-net, we think that's what we're expecting to see as we look forward as we indicated.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up is just a model question. You mentioned that the tax rate was a little bit better than you expected even though you guided it to be a little bit better in the original sort of 3Q guidance. I think you said it came in at 19%. Kind of what was the delta? I mean, we tried to do some math on the tax and I don't know if our math is right, but was it a $0.10 benefit ultimately or was it less than that, can you \u2013 is there a way you can dimensionalize that for us? We just want to make sure we got our numbers right.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. So, when we indicated slightly better than 23.5%, it would have only been slightly better than 23.5%. So to dimensionalize it, you can go from a number slightly under 23.5% and compare that to 2019.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's great. That's what I needed. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. To the extent that one of your competitors this week referred to ongoing share gains \u2013 I think some that have nothing to do with the breach and maybe some that \u2013 and I know they're hard to identify \u2013 may be related. But to the extent there are share shifts taking place in the market, Mark, can you just talk a little bit about sort of what you view as the tail on those? In other words, do some of the initiatives you highlighted in your comments, and John, in yours, start to sort of turn the tide do you think from a net share perspective at some point next year? How do I think about the tail on this?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. We understand it was a comment yesterday by one of our competitors in their earnings call about share gains against an unnamed competitor that had a data security breach. So, we are guessing they were talking about us.","We've \u2013 as I've been clear in our comments, we clearly \u2013 their revenue growth is stronger than ours, there is no question about that, both TU and Experian, so they're executing well in the marketplace and they are taking advantage of some of the pressures Equifax had post the data security breach. We've been consistent on prior calls that this is a competitive space that was competitive before the data security breach, it was in the last year as we've moved past the data security breach and when we're in the penalty box with customers, which we were in kind of the first half of the year and the fourth quarter last year, it's hard to do new business, it's hard to do some of the marketing solutions work. We haven't seen any loss of customers. So, we're clear about that.","There's always movements between primary and secondary that happen on an ongoing basis. And as I tried to mention in my comments, we've got our own pipeline of work that we're doing and those include competitive wins that we've notched on our belt, pipeline of new deals that we're working on that we've got expectation of winning and a pipeline of deals that we're working to win.","So, it's a space that has always been competitive and continues. I think the sequential improvement that you saw out of USIS in the third quarter versus second and we expect that to continue going forward. When I meet with customers, they really value our differentiated data and now that their security reviews are complete, they want to re-engage around our new products and our new insights.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And with regard to GCS and the return to marketing on the direct side of that business, are there going to be any changes to the product or enhancements or price adjustments that you think could influence adoption and it give you confidence that you can sort of stem the tide in that subsegment of your business?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. There's always work going on inside of that business as you might imagine. They're always testing new products and looking at new opportunities to offer protection products and other products to the marketplace.","As you know, the biggest impact was they went dark for a year. That was intentional on our part. And when you're not doing any marketing at all \u2013 and we actually took the products off the site. Even if someone found our site, there was no products there to buy over the last 12 months. That has a significant impact on the business.","And as we said, we lit up the site in October and we're doing some targeted online marketing in the fourth quarter and we expect that to accelerate. This isn't a large business for us on the direct-to-consumer business in the United States, but it's one that we want to be in and we will continue to invest either in products or in the advertising.","But don't take these comments that we're like doubling down or tripling down. This is a business that we like, we want to be in. We expect it to grow in the second half of next year as we get the benefits of some of the marketing work and the online advertising work that the team is doing starting now in October and flowing into the fourth quarter and into 2019.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","They'll also benefit from the technology reinvestment. They get a new platform next year that we think will ease the way they launch products and the way customers can interact with us and make that substantially improve. So, they will get a benefit there in addition to the \u2013 to what Mark already referenced.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Good morning. John, I think you have a second career if you want it as one of those people who talk so fast on drug TV commercials. That was an unbelievable pace and a lot of stuff you went through. I guess the question for you on margin. So obviously, there's a lot of these costs that you're pulling back for the tech transformation. But you also cited over the last couple of quarters some security and other costs at the segment level. Can you talk through the margin headwinds? I guess you also talked about third-party data costs being up to adjusted EBITDA, comp coming back is obvious. But what are some of the others? And what's the duration on some of those increased costs? Thank you.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","So I don't think I spoke about third-party data costs. But in terms of the total security cost, right, we talked about this early in the year, right, that we had thought that we would see about $0.30 a share specifically related to security, technology related to security, our risk office, our transformation activity and that we expected that to impact us in the year. And a lot of that is in corporate but a substantial amount of it is also in the businesses. So that's impacting both corporate expenses as well as business \u2013 as expenses you're seeing in the businesses and therefore impacting their margin. We also indicated in the beginning of the year that there's about $0.10 specifically related to insurance and you're seeing that in corporate.","So my comments I think in the script in several places are really referencing those total costs and they just happen to show up in both corporate as well as in the businesses as the businesses continue to grow out their security infrastructure and then also invest in technology.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then the follow-up. Just if we think longer term like three to four years from now, what will be the benefits from the tech transformation other than the security side of it, which I think is clear? And is this a help revenue and reduced cost when all is said and done? Or how do you think about the long-term benefits? Thank you.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yes, it's a great question and it's one that we want to give you some more visibility about as we finalize that technology plan for 2019 and beyond. And I think you hit the nail on the head. It's clearly going to be a cost structure improvement. As we simplify our applications and our infrastructure, there should be some meaningful cost savings there. And of course the cloud should also deliver that. But we also believe there's going to be some meaningful revenue opportunities for us as we ingest data more quickly and then also bring products across \u2013 to customers and also across the globe more quickly.","Today, we have to rebuild too many products when we take them from the States to Australia, Australia to Argentina et cetera. As we rebuild those products in the cloud they'll be more easily moved from one market to another. So, there's multiple layers of benefits from this that we think are going to be quite sizable. And our intent is to really differentiate ourselves from our competition with this investment in our technology infrastructure. And our goal is to share with you and the rest of the investment community, our kind of thoughts on those benefits which as you point out and we agree are multifaceted.","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Hi, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So a question for you on the auto weakness. I was going to ask if you could give us some color on that similar to what you've given on mortgage in terms of what the percentage was of revenue and the impact in the quarter. I know that your portfolio tends to be weighted towards the southeast and the impact to the storms there?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yes. So, effectively the auto market what we saw was that we had expected to see a little bit of improvement in the auto market in the quarter. And we really didn't see that. So, I think the comment was relative to our expectations. And so we saw relative to our expectations lower revenue. Part of it certainly was the fact that we're heavily weighted to the southeast and there was certainly some impact from the storms that occurred. Part of it also is that we're weighted to subprime and you're seeing some more weakness in the subprime part of the auto space than you have overall. But we had expected to see a little bit of improvement and we really just didn't see that in the auto space.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then you had called out the increased spending in the third quarter to accelerate the technology transformation. Being based in Boston, baseball is top of mind and so I wanted to ask what inning are we in, in terms of the technology transformation? When can we expect that to be complete?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, it's a tricky way, Bill, in trying anything. Congrats on your team there. But mine's not in it. But the tricky way to try to get some visibility of how long our spend is going to be. I don't think we can give \u2013 I would say, certainly its early innings. But I would say that we're making a lot of progress. We've really move forward. I would characterize in the second half of the year, in the third quarter, we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter particularly with our new CTO on board. We feel good about that progress going forward and we'll give you some clear visibility of which inning when that plan is complete and our expectation is that will be in January when we report our fourth quarter results.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Well thank you very much.","Operator","We'll now take the next question from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. On the improvement and online information I get that the mortgage market is tough and you're seeing an improved year-over-year trend despite that. But the year-over-year comp is also significantly easier. So, just help us understand that what's driving or that there is really improvement. Here you told about the commercial trended product, but maybe if you could talk about some new sales trends with clients or other specific products? Just help us understand that there's real improvement beyond the easier comp?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","So, again, as we indicated in the script, right? The positive what we saw, nice growth. We saw growth both in commercial and consumer. There was a 300 basis point headwind specifically because of the mortgage market being down 10%. And despite that we saw improved performance in both of those.","And yes, there was a breach impact in 3Q 2017, but it was really heavily in Financial Marketing Services. The impact in online was much less just because of the timing of the announcement, since the announcement was in September. So, I think really what we were heartened by the fact that we saw growth across both consumer and commercial and it was in an environment where we had a substantial headwind from mortgage in the period.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then on the guidance I get the tougher assumed mortgage market for Q4 relative to the pace of decline in Q3. But \u2013 and I know there was a variation of this question asked earlier. But I want to re-ask it, given that part of the reason for coming in below guidance this quarter was that there were some markets that got incrementally worse. So, when you talk about headwinds in Argentina and Australia are you assuming that you're going to see further deceleration in those businesses? And just maybe a comment on your thoughts on the consumer credit markets in the U.S. outside of mortgage. Are you seeing other risk factors in any of them? Thank you.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","So, specifically in terms of our guidance for the fourth quarter, I think we try to cover it in the script, right? The biggest market effect that we indicated affected us in the third quarter was really U.S. mortgage. And we indicated that was the largest, the most substantial by far and we are expecting further weakening there. And that's really the biggest driver in terms of a market weighted effect that impacted us in the third quarter and likely the biggest one that would impact us in the fourth quarter.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from David Togut from Evercore ISI.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Could you expand upon your comments with respect to Australia? The Veda acquisition did well for quite a while. Clearly this is more macro-oriented. But how are you thinking about the growth outlook for your Australian business over the next year or two?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. So again, so when we acquired Veda, we indicated we expected it would be a business that should grow mid to high-single digits in that range. We've seen relatively good performance over 2016 and 2017 and now through 2018. We've seen nice growth in 2018. The macro effects are certainly impacting us right now. The goal is that we should be able to continue to try to drive growth across that business as we move forward and our expectation is it should deliver consistent with our long-term expectations for the business.","Now obviously there can be ups and downs in any given quarter or any given year, but the trends we see in the business we think continue to be positive, we expect to be able to continue to drive some growth in Australia. As we look forward, we're hopeful about the benefits that we'll see out of comprehensive data that's now expanding there. That's something we'll take hold slowly. But again, it's something that we're expecting to provide us with some benefits as we look forward. So overall, we continue to think the Australia acquisition is a good acquisition and we would expect this to continue to see positive growth trends.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Just to clarify, are you saying you expect mid to high single-digit growth to continue in next year in Australia? Or you just expect to do well in 2019?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","I wasn't trying to make a specific comment about rate \u2013 about overall growth rates for next year. Just that as we look at the business over the long-term, we think the expectations that we had for it initially continue to be reasonable. As we \u2013 when we get into providing guidance for 2019, we'll talk more specifically about Australia for next year. Obviously, there are market effects that are going on right now in terms of consumer credit, which are certainly going to negatively impact Australia in the fourth quarter and depending on the duration certainly going into next year.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","As there are no further questions, I would like to hand the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks.","Trevor Burns - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, this is Trevor Burns.

Today's conference is being recorded.","And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Dodge","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge with Investor Relations. And with me today are Paulino Barros, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, among other things, acquisition-related amortization expense; certain costs related to the cybersecurity incident, including costs to investigate and remediate the cybersecurity incident; legal and professional services; a contingent liability for cost associated with providing free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection services to consumers; and the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and in the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.","Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income; depreciation and amortization; income tax expense and also excluding certain onetime items, including the cost related to the cybersecurity incident. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Paulino.","Paulino Barros ","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we provided an update on the cybersecurity incident that occurred last year. Let me provide now some perspective. In conjunction with the forensic investigation completed last fall by Mandiant, we concluded that the attack that was predominantly focused on selling Social Security numbers. So, we worked with Mandiant and defined a reasonable and sound methodology that use names and Social Security numbers as the key data elements to identify persons impacted.","As we continued to analyze the data, we were able to identify approximately 2.4 million consumers, whose names and partial driver's license information were stolen, but who were not in the previously identified population. The information was partial because in the vast majority of cases, it did not include home addresses, state of issuance, date of issuance and\/or expiration dates.","They were not identified using the original methodology as their Social Security number was not stolen. We use proprietary company records that the attacker did not steal and engaged the resources of external data provider in order to identify these consumers. Additional details on this can be found in yesterday's press release and in our 10-K. Ever since September 7, we have taken and will continue to take steps to reach out and assist consumers and our customers.","Transparency and open communication has been the cornerstone of our efforts following the disclosure. It is with this commitment in mind that we are actively reaching out and we will be offering those additional consumers identity theft protection and file monitoring services at no cost today.","In the 4 months since our third quarter earnings release, we have made substantial progress in the four critical areas of focus I highlighted. I would like to thank our 10,000-plus employees around the world for their tremendous execution and dedication over this period. I would like also to thank our customers and partners for their support as we remediate the cybersecurity incident and restore our reputation.","There will still be a lot of heavy lifting in 2018 and 2019 as we execute our information technology and data security plans, work to regain the confidence of our customers and consumers, work with regulators and state and federal governments and develop new solutions to protect sensitive consumer information in today's rapidly advancing technology ecosystem.","The Equifax teams understands the need for consistent strong execution against our plans over the next 18 to 24-month period with a focus on making Equifax a global leader in information technology and data security and to reestablish Equifax as the innovator in delivering data and analytics-based solutions and insights our customers use to make better decisions.","Fourth quarter financial results from ongoing operations came in better than unexpected both from revenue and cash EPS. Growth cost related to the cybersecurity incident came in about as expected, and we were partially offset by insurance and recoveries in the quarter. John Gamble will walk you through the details of the results, including the net costs related to the cybersecurity incident and the impact of the U.S. tax reform, as well as provide our current view of full year 2018.","We continue to make great progress on the four critical areas of focus we highlighted in our third quarter 2017 earnings call in November. These critical efforts are being closely managed by our transformation office with the support of outside advisors. First, improving consumer support and consumer's ability to understand and control access to credit information.","We believe that the data and analytical service that Equifax provides substantially increases transparency in credit decisions, allowing financial institutions and other businesses to make more informed and timely consumer credit decisions. Equifax believes, in general, this increases access to and reduces the cost of credit to consumers worldwide.","We are committed to work with others in our industry in providing education to help consumers better understand the role we play in the financial ecosystem and provide the technology to help consumer control access to credit information about them. We substantially improved both online and consumer support related to the TrustedID Premier service.","We offer it free to all U.S. consumers, including the free for life Lock & Alert service launched on January 31. We believe both the online and call center support experience will continue to substantially improve throughout the quarter. Through February 23, 97% of the calls were answered in less than 30 seconds and the abandon rate was less than 1%. We will continue to make improvements in the service throughout 2018.","The period in which we offer free credit freezes has been extended through June 2018. Currently, the number of credit freezes are less than 2% of the total U.S. credit file. This level of credit freezes have been relatively stable since mid-November. Lock & Alert was successfully launched on January 31, as we committed last fall. The service we offer is simple and easy-to-use.","A consumer can be seen in front of a lending officer, unlock their Equifax credit report, complete the loan approval process and then lock their report again. The ultimate control for the consumer is facilitating a decision for our product or service the consumer wants when they want it, and without exposing the information to fraudsters or criminals.","We have developed educational material to help consumers understand personal credit information and how they can best protect that information from fraudulent use. The material includes new video content to aid interest and educating, using everyday terms and language the consumer can easily understand. It can be found in our equifax.com website.","We have also integrated social media, including YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, to facilitate a new, more consumer-friendly conversation. I encourage each of you to try the service. ","Second, ensuring we take significant action to protect the consumer and commercial data that has been entrusted to us around the world. We are committed to becoming an industry leader in information technology and information security management, and the plans we have established reflect this goal.","Substantial progress has been made since November, working closely with our partners in four critical areas. A, strengthening IT and data security at the infrastructure network and application layers. Cyber operation has been enhanced to provide broad and redundant network visibility, intrusion protection detection and access monitoring and controls.","At present, we have three redundant teams, two external, executing cyber operations and system monitoring. We are and will continue implementing what we believe are industry best practice in systems. We announced the permanent CISO last week, Jamil Farshchi. He comes to Equifax with great experience from Home Depot, Time Warner, Visa and NASA.","Russ Ayres, our Interim CISO will work with Jamil during a leadership transition period to ensure we maintain consistent in our interactions with customers and regulators. Russ will continue with Equifax in a senior leadership position. I want to personally thank Russ Ayres for his incredible work over the past 6 months.","Work to streamline and simplifying our networks and application infrastructure has extended and accelerated. This initiative will not only enhance our security posture by reducing what is known as the attack surface, but it will also support the rest of product execution. And lower complexity should also enhance our network resiliency and ultimately, lower costs.","Modern processes and structures for the management of the information technology and data security have been and will continue to be refined and is present. We are adopting our robust enterprise risk management framework based on the three lines of defense used by leading financial institutions and in line with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's, FFIEC, framework.","Let me explain this model. The first line of defense is the operational line. The organizational leader, who directly own and manage the risk, in this case, IT and security. The second line of defense provides risk oversight. We are substantially building out a risk office, which will have a direct reporting line to the technology and other committees of the board. The risk office will be responsible for establishing risk frameworks, policy and standards, performing independent risk-based monitoring and testing and independently identifying and assessing material, IT and security risks.","The third line of defense is, as would be expected, our internal audit group, which we will supplement with third-party support. Internal audit working with third-party auditors will audit the effectiveness of second line oversight, as well as doing direct, extended audits of the first line. The technology commission of the board has been tasked with the oversight of IT security and data governance.","The risk office being formed will have independent reporting to the technology committee. Internal audit and certified audit plans and results will be revealed by the technology committee. An outside adviser, currently PwC, will report quarterly to the technology committee on the progress of our enhanced technology and information security governance against plans and will annually provide an overall risk assessment.","Risk escalation process have been revised to support rapid escalation of potential information and data security events, as well as other areas that would possibly require public disclosure and\/or the suspension of trading in Equifax securities by executives or personnel. The annual incentive plans for all employees have been revised to include achievement of information technology and data security priorities. Also, the senior leadership team will have additional measurable MBOs tied to information technology and data security.","Enhanced data governance and protection practice are moving forward as well. We have added a Chief Private and Data Government Officer to lead this area and drive consistent practice globally. Our 2018 and 2019 IT and security plans are substantially in place and execution is underway. Third, working with customers and partners to gain their insights reviewed for us and most importantly, solidify our historic relationships.","Transparency into the cybersecurity incident, our response and our overall plans is a continued area of focus. Over the past 4 months, we have significantly extended the path and frequency of detailed customer and partner meetings, both domestic and international. We believe these briefings have provided much greater clarity for both our customers and partners.","In addition to specific customer reviews, multiple whole day group briefings have been held for groups of customers and partner executives and security teams. The meetings have focused on detailed discussions of the incident, where immediate response and most importantly, our mid and long-term information technology and data security plans.","These briefings were led by our business unit presidents, our CISO, our CIO, our Chief Transformation Officer and PwC. And we believe we're very successful as they allowed customers and partners to interact. And we serve not only to improve understanding of our effort, but also to provide our customers and partners with insights that can assist their own IT and data security efforts.","We believe we are making good progress with customers and partners in terms of regaining their trust and their willingness to utilize our new and unique product offerings. As expected, we did see an impact related to these factors on our USIS and Workforce Solutions revenue in fourth quarter 2017. However, we saw this impact lessen as we moved through the quarter and more customers began purchasing new products as discreet services.","GCS revenue was impacted in fourth quarter 2017 to a greater extent than third quarter 2017, and the subscriber base was impacted by churn and the substantial reduction in customer additions. This was expected. And as we stop all direct-to-consumer advertising and gross selling activities in September, customers and partners continue to offer assistance and are collaborating to help us accelerate our IT data security implementations, and we greatly appreciate this partnership.","Fourth, responding to and working with government and other regulatory bodies as they investigate the incident. We are incorporating and working closely with U.S. state and federal regulatory agencies and legislators and several regulatory agencies outside the United States as they continue their investigation of the cybersecurity incident.","We continue to be fully committed to re-earning the trust of consumers and the governmental bodies chartered with protecting those consumers. The 2017 10-K filed last night provides details regarding the legal and regulatory claims against Equifax, generated related to the cybersecurity incident. Due to the very early stage in the process of these claims, we are unable to provide any view of potential outcomes.","As we look to 2018, in addition to their commitment to the four critical focus areas we just discussed, the business units are executing on their critical growth initiatives. Across USIS, Workforce Solutions and International, there are 3 common themes.","First, explaining the impact of analytics, including machine learning through Cambrian Ignite. Two, increasing penetration in the identity and fraud markets. And three, continue to grow solutions that integrate Equifax customers and third-party data sources, utilizing our global interconnect decisioning and IP gateway platforms.","USIS will drive New Product Innovation, NPI, and penetration of existing products through: one, driving Cambrian, Ignite and marketplace solutions across more customers and verticals, including trended data solutions and machine learning-based solutions; two, expanding real estate beyond mortgage to include rental markets and data; third, extending InstaTouch, an InterConnect-based product, across more verticals and customer interaction use case; fourth, driving market adoption of identity verification products, only ID, and other platforms-based products new to the market, late in 2017; and five, increasing market friction of our data-driven marketing solutions.","International had an outstanding year in 2017, particularly with delivering strong NPI-based growth. In 2018, they will drive growth through, one, increasing Cambrian, Ignite based solutions in Canada and Australia, including trended data and machine learning-based solutions, deploying Cambrian throughout Latin America and the U.K. to accelerate their delivery of advanced analytics; two, expanding market penetration in fraud prevention in Australia and Latin America using our global fraud exchange platform; three, building on their success in growing debt management globally, leveraging recent wins in Latin America and Canada; and fourth, building on recent wins in Europe, Canada and Latin America in decisioning solutions based on analytics through Cambrian and our InterConnect platform. ","Workforce Solutions delivered yet another strong year in 2017, driving by growth in the verification business. In 2018, they'll continue to drive growth through: one, continued expansion of channel partners and growth of records in verification database, leveraging significant operational improvements in the process of loading records into the database and accessing the database for verifications; two, international expansion of the verification business into Canada and Australia; and third, in Employer Services, expansion of our services in hiring and on-boarding solutions.","The Global Consumer Solution business unit is the most directly tasked with our critical focus on improving consumer support. And the U.S. consumer direct revenue was most significantly impacted by the cybersecurity incident.","In the first quarter 2018, as we launch the new free walk and alert service, we will continue to refrain from direct-to-consumer advertising for U.S. consumer direct-based products. We continue to evaluate the U.S. consumer direct business and will provide an update to you as decisions are made.","As they enter 2018, the GCS team will be focused on: First, continue the launch of Lock & Alert following the launch on January 31 and ensuring the delivery of outstanding service to the users of our TrustedID Premier service; second, improving the overall service levels throughout our worldwide consumer direct business; and third, beating and expanding our successful direct-to-consumer reseller business and our recent ID Watchdog acquisition in the U.S.","In NPI, our New Product Innovation, continue to make strong contribution to our revenue growth. We ended 2017 with 55 new product launches, a 10% vitality index, and the 107 active new product initiatives in the pipeline for 2018. Our current outlook for 2018 is to further build on the success we realized in 2017 and the three drivers with NPI revenue for 2018 included.","InstaTouch, digital ID, IBM fraud, Ignite and Cambrian compliance and connect and a variety of new solutions in the housing and the auto verticals. In 2018, the economic background for the major markets we service each generated favorable. Our expectation in U.S. GDP will be up between 2.5% and 3%. We expect modest growth in consumer credit, excluding mortgage.","Mortgage market inquiries volume is expected to be down double digits for the full year of 2018 as we expect refinancing to be down consistent with 2017, with purchase inquiry volume up strongly. Consumer credit activity is expected to be broadly up across autos, bankcard, retail card, nonrevolving credit and home equity.","Internationally, we are expecting the U.K. and Canada to show slow growth with GDP growth slightly under 2%. Australia is expected to show good growth at around 2.5% with growth in Spain slowing to just under 3%. The strongest growth is expected in Latin America, where our largest countries of Argentina and Chile are expected to see increased GDP growth. ","As we have said before, I and the entire Equifax organization apologize to the individuals whose personal information was stolen in the cyberattack, and we apologize as well as to our customers, partners, investors, communities and our seedlings [ph], who were disrupted by the cybersecurity incident at Equifax. ","And as I have met with our employees throughout the world, there's a consistent and great commitment to continue to execute on the critical objectives discussed today and last quarter, and to continue to deliver with differentiated products and solutions to our customers based on the industry-leading analytics and unique data assets that allow us to deliver consistent growth and performance over the past decade. They are also committed to regaining the consumer's trust and confidence in how we manage, secure and use information about them.","With that, let me hand it over to John.","John Gamble ","Thank you, Paulino, and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results else from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. For 2017, additional items excluded from our non-GAAP results are the onetime cost related to the cybersecurity incident and the onetime benefit related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We'll provide details on these two items so you can consider them in your analysis.","In total, in 2017, we incurred nonrecurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident of $164 million. These have been partially offset by insurance recoveries of $50 million resulting in a net nonrecurring charge of $114 million. The $113 million of gross costs were generally for legal, cyber forensic investigations and other professional services related to the investigation of the incident or nonrecurring actions to improve security.","$51 million in accrued and incurred gross expenses related to the TrustedID Premier service we offered free to all U.S. citizens. This represents our estimate of costs to service individuals using the service today. The above costs are offset by $50 million of insurance recoveries for costs incurred to date and for which we have received the cash. We have $125 million of cybersecurity insurance under our E&L policy. We continue to expect to make claims to fully utilize the policy.","In 4Q 2017, the net nonrecurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident were $27 million. This reflected $77 million in gross cost, principally legal and other professional services related to the investigation of the incident or actions to improve security, offset by the $50 million of insurance recoveries, $15 million of which was received in 2017. The $77 million in gross cost were consistent with the guidance we provided in November.","In 4Q 2017, we had $48 million nonrecurring after-tax benefit from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This benefit was principally from the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities at the lower U.S. tax rate, which was partially offset by lower benefit of various foreign tax items. We expect our effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 27%. There are still some aspects of the law that needs further clarification and as these become more clear, our expected tax rate could change.","Now let's look at our operating results for the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $839 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 4% on a local currency basis from Q4 2016. For the quarter, FX was an $8 million benefit. Adjusted EPS was $1.39, down 2%. In the quarter, we estimate that the cybersecurity incident negatively impacted total company revenue by just over 3%. This was consistent with the guidance we provided in November. USIS revenue in 4Q 2017 was $313 million, down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.","We estimate that the impact from the cybersecurity incident for USIS negatively impacted revenue by about 3.5% in the quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $211 million flat, when compared to the year-ago period. The decline in mortgage market activity, along with a negative impact of the cybersecurity incident, was partially offset by growth in other online activity, including banking in addition to growth in our ID and fraud solutions.","Total mortgage-related revenue for USIS was down 5% and total mortgage-related revenue for Equifax, including Workforce Solutions, was down less than 1%. This quarter was the first where we did not have the year-over-year benefit from trended data. As before, our performance continues to outpace the overall mortgage market or increase were down approximately 7%.","For the year, U.S. total mortgage related revenue was up 7%. Overall mortgage market increase were down for the year approximately 6%. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $69 million in 4Q 2017, up 1%. Revenue in this segment tends to be project oriented and as such, was more impacted by the cybersecurity incident. As we move through the quarter, performance in the segment improved.","Normalizing USIS revenue for the estimated negative impact of the cybersecurity incident and to a flat mortgage market, USIS revenue growth would have been between 4% and 5%. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 48.5%, down from 51% in 4Q 2016. The lower margins reflect the revenue decline in 2017.","International revenue was $245 million in 4Q 2017, up 15% on a reported basis and up 12% on a local currency basis. Growth was broad-based and benefited greatly from the new product revenue, which was very strong. Asia Pacific revenue was $79 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and up 10% local currency.","Europe's revenue was $75 million in 4Q 2017, up 17% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency. Both the U.K. and Spain saw strong growth across their credit businesses. Latin America's revenue is $55 million in 4Q 2017, up 16% in U.S. dollars and 19% in local currency.","Growth was again led by our largest countries of Argentina and Chile. Canada's revenue was $36 million, up 18% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Canada's growth was broad-based and reflects the strong performance showed throughout 2017.","International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.3% in 4Q 2017, down from 30.3% a year ago. The year-to-year was driven principally by litigation accruals unrelated to the cybersecurity incident. Workforce Solutions revenue was $183 million in the quarter, up 6% when compared to 4Q 2016. The cybersecurity incident impacted revenue by approximately 3.5 points and impacted the discrete business of Employer Services and to a lesser degree, that of Verification Service.","As the impact in EWS was more concentrated with government customers, we expect that will extend further into 2018 than with USIS. Excluding this impact, growth in 4Q was similar to 3Q 2017. Verification Services revenue was $126 million, up 11% with auto, consumer finance, government and talent solutions all delivering double-digit growth in the quarter.","Employer Services revenue of $57 million was down 5% versus last year. Employer Services, excluding Workforce Analytics, was down approximately 3%. This is the portion of Employer Services impacted by the cybersecurity incident. And excluding this impact, we would have seen low single-digit growth.","Workforce Analytics, the portion of the business that services employers and complying with the Affordable Care Act, was down about 10%. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.5% in 4Q 2017, down 30 basis points from the 45.8% in 4Q 2016. Severance costs incurred in the quarter more than explained the decline in margin.","Global Consumers Solutions revenue at $97 million in 4Q 2017 was down 2% on a reported basis and on a local currency basis. Revenue on the quarter was benefited by the ID Watchdog acquisition by about 4 points. Our U.S. consumer direct revenue declined almost 15% in the quarter as a result of the cybersecurity incident and the 3 TrustedID service we offer to consumers, we stopped marketing all U.S. direct-to-consumer revenue generating products in September. We therefore saw increased consumer churn levels in 4Q 2017.","We do not intend to advertise our U.S. paid products in the first half of 2018. Our 4Q 2017 partner and reseller revenue in our Canadian consumer direct revenues were slightly higher than 4Q 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.4% in 4Q 2017, down about 2 points from 4Q 2016. In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $77 million. Excluding the nonrecurring costs associated with the cybersecurity incident in 2017, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $55 million, down about $2 million from 4Q 2016.","Adjusted EBITDA margin for Equifax was 34.8%, down 170 basis points from 4Q 2016. Our GAAP effective tax rate was a 1.2% benefit in the quarter, reflecting the $48 million tax benefit from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the $2 million benefit from the income tax effect to stock awards. Excluding nonrecurring items, our 4Q 2017 effective tax rate using calculating adjusted EPS was 31.6%.","In 4Q 2017, operating cash flow is $207 million in free cash flow, which includes $60 million of capital expenditures, was $147 million. For calendar year 2017, operating cash flow was $816 million and free cash flow, which includes $218 million of capital expenditures, was $598 million, down 1% and 8%, respectively.","Cash outflow related to the cybersecurity incident, including capital spending, was about $85 million in 2017, heavily in the fourth quarter. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $61 million for 2017, total capital spending was $218 million or just over 6% of revenue. ","Total cash balance at year-end was $0.34 billion with total debt at year-end of $2.7 billion. Our net debt at year-end of about $2.37 billion was down $175 million from year-end 2016. Our gross leverage was 2.34x EBITDA and our net leverage was 2.05x EBITDA at year-end 2017, both down from 2016.","Looking at operating results for 2017 in total. At a high level, revenue of $3.36 billion was up 7% in constant currency. Organic constant currency revenue growth was about 5%. We estimate that the cybersecurity incident negatively impacted revenue by just over 1 point.","Adjusted EBITDA grew almost 10% to $1.24 billion and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded about 100 basis points to 36.8%. Adjusted EPS was $5.97, up 8%. Again, this excludes both the nonrecurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident and the nonrecurring tax benefit from the 2017 tax reform.","Now moving to guidance. In 2018, Equifax will be executing against the critical focus areas Paulino outlined earlier, as well as managing through the legal and regulatory issues related to the cybersecurity incident. To provide transparency into our financial performance, in addition to our GAAP results, we will be providing guidance in the following way.","Our non-GAAP financial results will include all increased costs related to IT and data security that are ongoing or permanent in nature. We will exclude from our non-GAAP financial results both the incremental or bubble costs incurred to implement our IT and data security plans and the legal and or professional service cost being encourage specifically to address the litigation and governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident.","We will provide separate guidance as to the combined level of these costs. In terms of measurement, we have defined incremental IT and data security project costs that will be excluded from non-GAAP results to be limited to resource additions related to the projects being executed to address IT and data security; purchases of hardware, software or services to support projects being executed to address IT and data security; and when IT and data security projects are completed, put in service and stable, those costs will be deemed permanent and be included in non-GAAP financial results.","Now on to our 2018 guidance. For 2018, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $3.425 billion and $3.525 billion reflecting growth of 2% to 5% with about 1% benefit from FX. U.S. mortgage market inquiries are expected to be down about 10% with the resulting revenue headwind of about 2%. We are expecting continued impact from the cybersecurity incident in 2018 with the greater impact in the first half.","USIS is expected to have revenue growth percentage from flat to low single digits. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to decline up to 100 basis points. Workforce Solutions should have revenue growth percentage in the high single digits, approximately consistent with 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin should be flat but up slightly.","International should have revenue growth in the low double digits, but below the levels of 4Q 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margins should expand, but to a lesser degree than in 2017. Global consumer services should see revenue decline over 10%. U.S. consumer direct revenue will accelerate its decline and represent well under one-third of GCS revenue in 2018.","Our current plans are based on the assumption that direct advertising and U.S. consumer will be minimal in 2018. The remainder of GCS is expected to deliver growth in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to decline significantly from 2017. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $5.80 and $6.00 a share with approximately $0.02 benefit from FX. ","To provide a basis of comparison for 2018 adjusted EPS versus 2017, the following impacts outside of the business units may be helpful. Calendar year 2017 adjusted EPS of $5.97 reflects both a lower than target annual incentive plan payment to employees and an effective tax rate of 31.8%, well above the 27% we are forecasting for 2018. If you normalize 2017 for these two items, increasing AIP to target and lowering the effective tax rate to 27%, you would need to increase our 2017 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.15 a share.","Ongoing cost related to IT and security, as well as costs related to the free services, including the Lock & Alert service we launched in January, are expected to be about $0.30 per share with the bulk of this cost increase in IT and security. Increased insurance costs will impact 2018 by approximately $0.10 per share. Over time, we would hope this increase insurance cost will decline.","As Paulino indicated, our focus is to be a leader in IT and data security. Our investments in 2018 and 2019 will reflect this. And in 2018, we are expecting approximately $200 million of net incremental IT and data security project costs and legal and professional fees being encouraged specifically to address the litigation and governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. This represents gross cost of $275 million, offset by $75 million of insurance proceeds.","Legal and professional fees related to litigation and regulation are expected to represent about 25% of this cost. These costs will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial results and guidance. If we are able to execute the IT and security projects more rapidly in 2018, we will do so. As a result, these cost assessments may increase.","Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be generally at to slightly below the levels delivered in 4Q 2017. Capital spending is expected to be approximately 8% of revenue, above the 6% level in 2016 and 2017, reflecting increased spending for IT and data security.","For 1Q 2018, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $850 million and $860 million, reflecting growth of 2% to 3% with about a 1% benefit from FX. Mortgage market increase are expected to be down approximately 5% with resulting headwinds to revenue growth of about 1%.","Revenue growth in USIS and Workforce Solutions will be below the full-year levels discussed as we expect some continued impact from the cybersecurity incident in the first quarter. International growth will also be below the full-year expectation. Adjusted EPS was expected to be between $1.34 and $1.39 per share with approximately $0.01 of FX benefit. ","Gross cost for incremental IT and data security project costs and legal and professional fees being encouraged specifically to address the litigation and governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident, which are excluded from our non-GAAP financial results are expected to be approximately $70 million. This amount will be reduced by any insurance recoveries in 1Q 2018. ","Now let me hand it back to Paulino for some final comments.","Paulino Barros ","Thanks, John. We have made a lot of progress in the quarter addressing our commitment to consumers, customers, partners and regulators. The business units are executing well and our center of excellence providing strong support to all our efforts. However, there's still more work ahead of us and regaining our credibility with our constituencies, including our shareholders. The DNA of this company is underpinned with both, a deep commitment to strong ethical principles and values and a strong focus on execution.","As I have mapped with our employees throughout the world, I sense a great level of enthusiasm and commitment to move this company forward with a heightened level of focus on protecting and safeguarding all of the consumer and commercial information we store and manage.","And with that, operator, we will now open it up for questions.","Jeff Dodge","Operator, I realize that the formal part of our presentation has been a bit longer than usual. We will stay past the 9:30 stop that we would normally do, but I doubt that we will be able to get through the queue, and so I want to apologize in advance to those who were not able to get their questions out, but we will be available later today by phone. So, with that operator, could you activate the Q&A session please.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first from Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. ","Jeff Goldstein","Hi, this is Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. Thanks for taking my questions. Just now that we're almost 6 months since the breach, can you talk about how your conversations with customers have been evolving? Are the customer audits continuing? Or have you been more successful in converting new business? Do you think these audits are going to end soon? And on that topic, do you think any permanent share shift has occurred at this point? ","Paulino Barros","Our conversation continues to be very positive in this sense, as I explained the last quarter, coming from the emotional perspective to a more rational perspective. As you could imagine, we have been there in several hundreds of customers, talking to them about what happened, what caused, how it can help them actually to improve. Actually, the conversation runs about how we can improve their security system to be update in the areas that we're doing in improving our relationship.","We have two customers that have a higher level of requirements for us to achieve, but it's not the majority of the customers. The most affected area in the company is the USIS; followed by Workforce Solution; and then, of course, GCS because the consumers, since we are not advertising anymore, we're not getting new consumers, and least in international. So, we haven't seen any specific share shift in the B2B side of the business.","Of course, we have seen a degradation of the GCS consumer base, but nonmajor share shifting has happened so far. And as we continue to demonstrate our ability to understand and invest in our projects for the customers, the more closer they get to us and to the point they're now returning to acquire new services and products that we have.","John Gamble","We did talk about the impact of the cybersecurity incident on revenue, obviously, in the third and fourth quarters, and we said there'd be a continuing impact in the first quarter. So that as those impacts are now transitioning over 6 to 7 months, clearly, you're seeing some movement in revenue because of the fact that we are seeing an impact to us, right? But again, as Paulino said, we think the progress is very good with our customers in terms of our conversations. ","Jeff Goldstein","That's helpful. Thank you. And then just within USIS in the quarter, revenue growth was only down modestly, but margins were down 260 basis points. So, I was just wondering if were there more operating investments this quarter maybe in light of the breach? Or is there just anything else to call out there to explain that margin decline with revenue growth only down modestly? Thanks.","John Gamble","Really nothing specific, right? Obviously, the revenue at USIS is relatively rich. Mix shift can also affect it in the quarter. Our plans would have been built around assuming continued growth in USIS. So, since that didn't occur, we did have some elevated expense levels in the fourth quarter. And then, therefore, with the lower levels of revenue, we saw a bigger impact on margins than you saw in the third quarter. But nothing specific beyond that.","Jeff Goldstein","Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brett Huff, Stephens. ","Brett Huff","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two, one big picture, and then one just sort of making sure we understand the numbers. Regarding sort of the numbers on USIS or the overall USIS business, some of your competitors were growing sort of mid-to-high single digits. You guys said were down minus 2%. Maybe it would have been 4% or 5% ex the breach. There's still a delta there between, I think, where your peers are and where you guys are in terms of growth.","You mentioned you don't see any permanent share shift. Is the delta between those two numbers, the normalized number for you and sort of the peers, is that just a temporary delay? Or is that how we should continue to understand that, that revenue hasn't disappeared, it's just delayed? Is that right? ","John Gamble","So, in terms of the impact of the cyber incident, again, we're not talking about revenue impacts that will have lasted 6 to 7 months. I wouldn't consider that delayed. That's revenue that has been lost. So, that's how I think you should consider that revenue. In terms of comparing us, the 4% to 5% growth, again, the model we have had prior to this, and I'm not reestablishing the model here, but I'm using it as a reference point. ","The prior model we had for USIS was somewhere between 5% and 7%. So, to the extent taking these effects into account and excluding them, obviously, and adjusting for mortgage, if we're somewhere near 5% given the environment we're in right now and the effects of the cybersecurity incident that might be difficult to measure, I don't think 4% to 5% is that bad.","Brett Huff ","Okay. And then the second question is just on the cost. I want to make sure I understand. You're spending money, and then determining kind of which ones are going to be ongoing and which ones sort of taper. Once you determine the expenses that are going to be going, that's when you roll it into, including that cost in your pro forma EPS. Is that, am I hearing that right? ","John Gamble","That's correct. So, in terms of when something is going to be considered nonrecurring, we're measuring it against specific project definition. So, the project has to be defined and agreed upfront and generally, some type of deployment or implementation. And when that occurs or in some cases, elimination. A significant part of the spending is around elimination of systems, not the addition of new. And when those projects are completed and then put into service and stable, then we make them ongoing. And it's only the cost of getting them into service and stable that we will exclude and consider nonrecurring.","Brett Huff","Great. Thanks for the clarifications.","Operator","We'll go next to Gary Bisbee, Royal Bank of Canada. ","Gary Bisbee ","Yes, thanks. Let me just follow up on that last one, can you give us any kind of an estimate what the increase would be in the ongoing expense once all the stuff you're - the projects you just referenced that will be excluded now go into - once the things are turned on? I mean, should we think that's another step-up in 2019? Or is it just too hard to know at this point?","John Gamble","So, we gave you a specific number for 2018. I can't give you a number beyond 2018. But in general, I think the way we think about it is to the extent we're successful, a reasonable portion of what we're doing results in system simplification. And since that's the case, the simplification should actually help drive IT costs down. Now there will be some increased costs for data security over time that will continue to escalate as we go forward.","We expect that to be permanent. It was happening even before the cybersecurity incident. But a significant portion of the expenditure is around simplification, which that simplification will also hopefully drive lower IT costs in the future. If you look at our total IT cost as a percent of revenue, we spend at a healthy rate today. So, there's opportunity there.","Gary Bisbee ","Okay, great. And then just thinking about revenue, I guess, a two-part question. I think you said that the bookings trends improved somewhat during the quarter. Can we get some more color on that and what's happening there? And then can you help us frame - when bookings do sort of normalize at some point, how long does it take to ramp back up to the type of growth you would have been at? I mean, it strikes me if you lose a lot of the bookings momentum for 6 to 12 months, that there's another probably 12 months after that to sort of refill the pipeline and whatnot, and so it would be a slow build back. Is that right? Thank you.","John Gamble","So, I think the first part of your question is effectively how do we determine the value that we're indicating for the impact of the cybersecurity incident on revenue. And basically, the way we do that is we take a look at transactions that we could see had a reasonable likelihood of executing. And then we know a reasonable rate where those would have converted in the past and when that rate is substantially lower than we would have normally seen looking forward, we would attribute that to the cybersecurity incident. And that's how we did it. It's the same thing we did in the third quarter.","Looking forward in terms of looking at 2018, we've given guidance for USIS for 2018. So, the best thing I can point you at is the guidance we've given for 2018. And as we move through the year, we'll talk more about how we're seeing the revenue performance progress. And then we'll talk more about how we're seeing new product deployments occur, which we've done historically. So, I think you'll be able to get a view based on those discussions as we go forward.","Gary Bisbee","Alright, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust. ","Andrew Jeffrey ","Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, I'm trying to ascertain, Paulino, you talked about a few growth initiatives where you're really focused and enthusiastic. I'm thinking about in the U.S. this year, fraud, ID, enhanced marketing offerings, et cetera. Can you just comment on sort of where we are in terms of NPI, vitality or momentum and how much the long-term effect, if any, disruption in the strong NPI growth that we've seen over the last few years informs the structural growth opportunity for Equifax, recognizing that vintages build on each other? I just wonder how much of a disruption we've seen in the new product initiative growth drivers. ","John Gamble","Paulino is going to address the specifics. But just to remember what we've said historically, right, is that we do expect to see deferral in the NPI pipeline as we go into 2018 because, obviously, we are taking a significant amount of resource and focusing it on IT and data security. So, you will see some of that, and it will result in a lengthening of the time period it takes us to develop and deploy new products. But I think Paulino can talk about it more.","Paulino Barros","Yes. If you look at the numbers that we achieved in 2017, right, the number of products that we have in the pipeline and the number of products that we launched. Our cycle is usually 18 months, right - 12 to 18 months to launch a product. [Indiscernible] the digital products more and the network products. Fortunately, we will enter 2018 with 107 new products in the pipeline, which will help us in the next 18 to 24 months. As we mentioned before, as we learn in this process, right, it takes that long first to fix the issues and to improve to a different level what we have here in the company.","So, as John mentioned, we are moving some of the resources that we have to make sure that we improve our security and IT, as we mentioned. Now we still have part of it that we will continue to work in new products. And we continue to work in acquisitions. We continue to be looking for new opportunities. Again, John mentioned correctly. And as we've said last time, we are taking resources and initially were used to NPI towards making sure that we execute and do it right and fast on the IT and security areas.","John Gamble","Long, long term to a private question. To the extent we're successful as we simplify the systems based on the investments we're making, then that should also be beneficial to new products, as we pointed out. But again, that's after you're completed.","Andrew Jeffrey ","And have you seen any disruption Rest of World, recognizing that international markets were less impacted by the breach? Or is some of the initiatives, exporting Cambrian and so forth, are those relatively uninterrupted? ","Paulino Barros","Definitely, customer base. But if you - at the end of the day, Canada has been a very small impact. U.K. has been growing. Europe has been growing. Spain, a very important growth for us last year. Adopting, maybe because they're kind of one phase behind the U.S. launching new products and we're trying to expand one of the efforts that has been made in this company for years now is to expand our global platform, which has helped us significantly.","Like, if products change, Cambrian and eventually, we will take InstaTouch outside of the U.S. So, to a lesser extent, we see that. But also important is the fact that a lot of the NPI that is driven by - that are driven by international are local as well. So, we have seen significant - actually, international continues to be one of the engines of this company for growth because they're NPI-based programs.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to David Togut, Evercore ISI. ","David Togut ","Thank you, good morning. You indicated that the negative impact of the breach receded throughout the quarter, both in USCIS and Workforce Solutions. I'm wondering, as you look at the linearity of the quarter, particularly in USCIS, did you actually return to growth in that business in the month of December?","John Gamble","Yes. We don't break things really down by month in terms of our public disclosures. But again, the reason we said that we saw improvement as we went through the quarter in terms of the performance of those businesses related to the cybersecurity incident is, we began to deliver at a better pace versus the forecast that we've had for ourselves in areas that were impacted by the cybersecurity incident. So, we saw a lessening of the impact that we have expected as we moved through the quarter.","David Togut","Understood. And then in terms of WS, you've indicated that you continue to have conversations with governments to restart that business a bit. Can you flesh out how those conversations are going? And are there any milestones we can track from our perspective to know how you're progressing in EWS as you go through 2018? ","John Gamble","Are you referring to Workforce Solutions? ","David Togut","Yes, Workforce Solutions. ","Paulino Barros","Yes, Again, I think that we have - especially for the verification side, we have several government agencies that use our services, right? It's definitely a very sensitive area, and we have to move with a lot of caution and to make sure that we regain the trust and confidence of these customers. We have been working on that. Rudy Ploder and myself have been at those customers, talking to them, explaining to them, offering for them to comment and see what we have implemented to audit our process as well to make sure that we can rebuild our trust with this segment of the industry.","John Gamble","It's important to keep in mind, as we've mentioned, Verification Services performed well in the quarter. And as we've indicated, we expect it to continue to perform very well. So, Verification Services, which is the engine of growth and margin in that business and continues to perform well. We continue to add contributors to the database. So, we're quite happy with the performance of Verification Services as we look into 2018 and move through the year. We did indicate that for the first quarter, you'll see EWS to be a little weaker than the full year number. But overall, Verification Services is performing well. ","David Togut","Understood. Quick final one. You're indicating GCS will likely return to growth in 2019. What underlies that conviction?","John Gamble","Yes. In terms of specific guidance beyond 2018, we're not going to give specific guidance beyond 2018.","David Togut","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to George Mihalos with Cowen and Company.","Allison Jordan","Good morning. This is Allison Jordan in for George. Thank you for taking my question. John, I know you laid out increased costs related to IT and data security when you detailed guidance. Can you help us think about how we should model corporate expense line in 2018 and the growth there?","John Gamble","In terms of the specific line item itself, most of those areas that I indicated had increased costs will impact the corporate line. So that's where you should model them. And also, the insurance cost, most of that cost will hit the corporate line. So, we should model that as well, but beyond that, no, nothing specific. We did also indicate obviously in the discussion that bonus accruals were down, so those should increase. So, all of those items should affect your corporate line. But in terms of specific guidance on corporate, we don't provide guidance by line item.","Allison Jordan ","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. Online Information Solutions exited the year basically flat in terms of revenue growth. It seems like that business is poised to return to growth. Can you help us think about the outlook for OIS in 2018?","John Gamble","Yes. Again, so we gave guidance for the USIS in total. So, the specific line item guidance, we don't really provide.","Allison Jordan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning guys. My first question is just more around the future of the direct consumer segment. Maybe can you just give us a sense of how many people actually signed on to the free TrustedID product you're providing and maybe how well it's running? Because personally, the experience here hasn't been too great. I mean, I guess, compared to at least the experience in TransUnion. Once we all signed onto, I don't think we've heard at all from TrustedID. So, I was just curious how that's performing. And do you guys actually think of speeding up the marketing spend in the second half of the year?","John Gamble","So, in terms of TrustedID, we think the performance, at this point, has been relatively good, right? We believe the call center support has been very good, and we're not hearing, at this point, that there are significant issues around TrustedID. To the extent you have specific issues with TrustedID, obviously, we are very interested in hearing what they are because we work to address them. We continue to invest in the service and to try to make it better because, obviously, the people that signed up deserve to have the best service we can possibly provide. Can you give me your second question again?","Manav Patnaik ","Well, just the number of people that signed on for it and how should we think of the future of that segment. Like, how much do you spend on it?","John Gamble","So, you're referring to GCS specifically?","Manav Patnaik","Yes. ","John Gamble","So, in terms of the total number of people that have enrolled in TrustedID, that's not a number we disclose. In terms of GCS, I think as Paulino mentioned, for this year, we're not going to be advertising in the U.S. consumer segment in the first half of the year. And we indicated that the amount of advertising for the full year is expected to be relatively low. But in terms of specific plans for the segment, in general, I think that's something we're still working. And then we'll give you updates on that as we move through the year and make those determinations.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, fair enough.","Paulino Barros","Our focus will be to launch the Lock & Alert service, right, to make sure that we deliver in our commitment at November last and make sure that the consumers have a great level of service in that area.","Manav Patnaik ","Got it. And then just my second question is more, I think in the 10-K, you mentioned you're making a lot of strategic changes to your executive leadership team. I was just hoping you could give us a little bit more detail on what you've moved around and what's going on there?","Paulino Barros","I think you're referring to the inclusion of the seasonal reporting to me. So, this happened actually in the third quarter since - actually, a couple weeks after I arrived here. We have made a few changes at that time, which included the separation of the chief information security office from the - under the IT and reporting directly to the CEO. And also creating the chief transformation office area to make sure that we address all the issues related to the cybersecurity incident and respond to the cybersecurity incident with a focus to let the business units to continue to be focused on the business side and creating one area that can provide support for the cybersecurity incident, resources and actions.","John Gamble","Yes. And I think in Paulino's prepared remarks, right, there was a substantial amount of discussion around the specific governance structures that have been created, including risk office, tech committee and other areas, that strengthen governance around security, as well as drive culture around security more than just technology. So that is a fair amount of detail there.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","We'll go next to George Tong, Goldman Sachs. ","George Tong ","Hi, thanks, good morning. Paulino, I'd like to dig deeper into the revenue impact from the breach. Can you elaborate on whether prior new business deferrals have translated into revenues at this point and how the breach impact on revenue will play out as you move through 2018?","Paulino Barros","As I mentioned on the transcript, right, our performance - third quarter was tough because there was a lot of negative energy around and unknowns around. And as we move to fourth quarter, there were - we have more time to prepare and to be able to reach out to customers and work with them, explaining what happened, how it worked and the actions that we put in place in order to remediate and build the future. We have seen - as we mentioned earlier, we have seen a lesser impact at the end of the fourth quarter.","As we continue to work with the customers and demonstrate to them our improved [indiscernible] and the fact that, actually, we are raising the standards of what we want to operate, which is a - was very well welcomed by the financial institutions area. We are, of course, coming from cybersecurity incident. So therefore, we're being very careful on how we forecast our numbers to make sure that we don't break our tradition to be very close to execution reality, like we have been in the last 12 years.","George Tong ","Got it, okay. And I guess the earlier question, how you expect the breach impact on revenues to play out as you move through 2018, is that mainly a first half headwind that you expect, and then it fully dissipates by the second half?","Paulino Barros","I don't think it will be that black and white.","John Gamble","I think we'll just have to tell you as we move through the year, right? We're certainly expecting an impact. Our planning would assume that it will be greater in the first half than the second half. But obviously, as we move through the year, we'll just try to keep you updated because it's obviously a fluid situation. But we are making progress. ","Paulino Barros","Yes. ","George Tong ","Got it. And then, John, you indicated that you expect $200 million in net IT legal and professional fees that are onetime in nature. Can you flesh out your expectation for ongoing costs related to the breach and how you expect EBITDA margins - adjusted EBITDA margins to trend as you move through the year?","John Gamble","So, in terms of specific trending on March, we gave first quarter guidance and full-year guidance. And in my prepared remarks, we did talk a bit about the expenses we expected to incur in 2018 specifically related to security, and then also that we expected to incur specifically related to insurance. And that was in the prepared remarks. So, I think that detail is there, so you should be able to use that in your estimates.","George Tong ","Right. Well, I guess, the question was around when you expect the ongoing costs to be essentially executed. When do you expect your investments to be made as you move through the year? Is it going to be front-end loaded or back-end loaded as you make your ongoing investments?","John Gamble","I'd say the ongoing investments are going to occur over the year., but in terms of the exact timing of when individual activities will get executed, I can't give you an estimate on that.","George Tong","Okay, got. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum, Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum ","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I want to ask a little bit about GCS. There was talk about not marketing in the first half of 2018. It sounds like there will be marketing direct-to-consumer in the second half of 2018. At the same time, there's kind of a discussion of strategically trying to figure out what to do with that business. Can you give us just a little bit more color on that? Is the thought to when the 12 months of free monitoring is up, to go ahead and offer something for that\u2019s a paid subscription? Or is there just a thought of migrating this to a different provider? Or can you just give us some thoughts on that?","John Gamble","Yes. Look, and it's a very - I certainly understand the reason for the question. And at this point in time, I think we just need to go back to the comments we made in the prepared remarks, which is we'll be able to - we'll give you more detail on how we're going to move ahead with the GCS business as we move through the year. But what we've indicated is that no advertising or marketing spend in the first half. We expected limited for the full year so that would indicate limited for the second half, and that's the way the planning base is built. But we'll - as we move through this year, we'll provide you with more information should anything change and as we get more specifics around that business, okay? ","Shlomo Rosenbaum ","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just in terms of the revenue in the quarter. It was actually - it did not decline that much. And I was wondering if your partners and resellers had a big bump in the fourth quarter, due to the cybersecurity breach. So, although your own direct-to-consumer business suffered from churn, but those that you're selling data to actually had a benefit from that, and they're purchasing it from you.","John Gamble","So not so much - the biggest benefit we got, obviously, in the quarter was really ID Watchdog, right, so the purchase of ID Watchdog. We got the full effect of the revenue from that purchase in the fourth quarter, so that was certainly beneficial. And then also, we've seen relatively good performance in Canada related to - in our GCS business in Canada, so you saw some benefit there. And those were two significant drivers. We also - this is the quarter in which we lapped our - the change in contract with Credit Karma. So that was a benefit to us in the period simply because we lapped the contract period year-on-year. So, I'd say those are the three things that probably affected GCS outside of the U.S. consumer business more than anything else. ","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Alright, thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Tim McHugh, William Blair.","Tim McHugh ","Just a follow-up a little on the - or consumer business. Can you talk about the margins? I guess I think your comment was they'd be down a couple hundred basis points, which, I guess, given the revenue weakness, is understandable. But you also talked about minimal advertising expense. So, can you kind of walk through the puts and takes with that? And just trying to understand, as you do start advertising, how to think about the margins of the business.","John Gamble","Yes. So, I think you kind of just did the puts and takes, right? So, obviously, we had a reasonable revenue decline. And then the most significant offset was related to the fact that we didn't have - that the marketing expense was obviously substantially declined for the worldwide. There was some marketing expense outside the U.S., but very minimal. So, and those were really the most substantial puts and takes regarding the margins of the business report.","Tech spend was up a little bit because we're investing in Lock & Alert and TrustedID deployments, which would be incremental, too, which you'd normally see in that business because those are both - those both won't generate any revenue. But that - those are the general puts and takes that you see in that business right now.","Tim McHugh ","Okay. And then just, I guess, two smaller ones. One, can you talk at all about the Mercury acquisition? I guess how big is it? And a little more information about it. And then on the tax rate, I guess, can you talk through - I thought it would be probably a little lower. But what are the puts and takes there, as well as - not to add a [indiscernible] on that, but the adjusted tax rate has typically been lower than the GAAP tax rate. I guess I assume the 27% was more the GAAP number, but can you talk about that at all? Thanks.","John Gamble","Okay. So, Mercury, it's a relatively small business, right, in Australia. I don't think we specifically disclosed the revenue size. But it's a relatively small business, and it's generally related to the onboarding, employee services, employee onboarding and assisting companies in onboarding and new employees. So, it's somewhat consistent with the types of business we would have in our Workforce Solutions business in the U.S. It's also consistent with the type of business we would have in Australia. You might want to say more. ","Paulino Barros","Correct, yes. Well, actually, it just happened when I was doing this in Australia, we're finishing up the process. And it's a very unique, small business, a tuck-in, that we had in the area of employment side. We believe that this can help us in the future in the area to implement or to deploy our Workforce Solutions - The Work Number in Australia as well. This was a strategic move, a very unique company, very well positioned in Australia that we thought it was going to be of strategic value for us in the future.","John Gamble","In terms of tax rate. So, the 27% communicated is a little higher than you expected. So, there are still a fair number of the application of the Tax Act outside of the U.S., and certain circumstances are still unclear. So as those items are resolved, there's an opportunity for our tax rate to adjust. I would guess that based on the open items that are out there, if it's going to adjust, it would probably adjust down. But that's still not sure. But - so if it looks a little higher than you would expect, then I think it's probably driven by the fact that there's a fair number of uncertainties around the treatment of some specific tax items outside the U.S. As those become more clear, we can get more specific on the tax rate.","Tim McHugh","And then just is that a GAAP, is that the GAAP rate? Or is that the adjusted rate after we take into account kind how you apply taxes to the add-backs?","John Gamble","I think that should be approximately our GAAP and adjusted rate. They should be similar.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin McVeigh, Deutsche Bank. ","Kevin McVeigh ","Great. Thanks. You made a couple of comments about expanding into the rental market as part of real estate. And just if I heard right, just no benefit from trended data. Can you just talk about those two items a little bit more?","John Gamble","Yes. And I'm sorry, just on the last question. So, there are adjustments. Obviously, the tax effects of the sale of the execution of employee stock options, et cetera, those benefits, we don't take in our non-GAAP rate, which do affect GAAP, right. So, my apologies for missing that in the last answer. So, can you ask your question again?","Kevin McVeigh ","Yes, of course. The market opportunity for the rental market, be on mortgage in real estate. And then if I heard right, it sounded like you're lapping the benefit of trended data on the mortgage side. Are we through that at this point? Or just any thoughts on that as well.","John Gamble","Let me just kill off the second one real quick. So trended data, yes. So trended data, we launched trended data a year ago in August, right? So, for fourth quarter, there was no trended data in 2016 or 2017 in mortgage.","Paulino Barros","Yes, on the rental side, we actually expanded this vertical. Given our success and understanding of the mortgage side, we expanded - we call this vertical no housing, which includes both, mortgage and rental, which provides a great opportunity. We have very little penetration in this market, and we have already made some strides towards it. We brought some experts in the area to work with us, and we believe there is a great opportunity for us to expand in the future.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. And then, John, any thoughts on when you return to buybacks?","John Gamble","No specific guidance at this point in time. Right now, what we're focused on is executing the plan that Paulino laid out and the IT and security actions that we discussed.","Kevin McVeigh","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo. ","Bill Warmington ","Good morning everyone. You mentioned that the negative revenue impact from the cyber breach improved throughout Q4. Has that trend continued throughout Q1?","John Gamble","Yes. Certainly, we're not going to talk really specifically about Q1 at this point, right? And again, just to make sure I was clear in what I said, right, it was - what we said is the impact expected from the cyber breach in the specific business lessened as we moved through the quarter, right? So, it's a statement relative to our own expectation.","Bill Warmington ","Right, right. Okay. And then a follow-up question. Are you seeing a return of the project-related revenue, specifically the revenue that had been put off as a result of the cyber security audits?","John Gamble","Yes. So, I think Paulino addressed this a little bit earlier, right, which is as we move through and we work with, with varying customers through the process that they have to make sure that they're comfortable with the cyber IT and data security actions we're taking. As we complete those reviews with a given customer, then we see that the process changes, and then our ability to sell discrete projects, as well as new products improves. And as we make progress with our customer base through that process, and we are making progress, then we see the opportunities to continue to sell new products. And then also, those discrete projects improves with time, and we are seeing that occur.","Paulino Barros","Yes. And like I mentioned at the beginning, the more rational that we get about the process and the more that we make progresses within our remediation and investment program in IT and security-related areas, the more we expect this progress to continue. But at this time, it's not a trend.","Bill Warmington","Okay. Excellent. Thank you for the insights.","Paulino Barros","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan. ","Andrew Steinerman ","Hi, John. Before you were talking, you mentioned you are going to formally restate at least part of the long-term algorithm about USIS. And I look at Page 30 of the 10-K and I see the multiyear algorithm stated and somewhat revised, 6% to 8% organic plus 1% to 2% revenue growth. And then the language that I think is revived is EPS growing faster than revenue growth over time due to operational leverage and financial leverage.","Obviously, the old goal was 10% to 13%. So, my question is, now post-breach, is there a different view about operating leverage? And I just want to make sure since it's in the 10-K that 6% to 8% organic growth for medium term is being restated today as the goal. ","John Gamble","Okay. We're - Andrew, we're looking for that.","Andrew Steinerman ","Page 30 of the 10-K.","John Gamble","Sorry - we're - how about we just - and I apologize here. We're not able to find where you're seeing that.","Andrew Steinerman ","Over the long term, it starts. It's under business environment and company outlook. It's the second paragraph.","John Gamble","Andrew, we don't see it here, so we'll have to take it off-line. So, we're not sure what you're referring to, okay? So, we'll maybe ... ","Andrew Steinerman ","Okay. Thank you.","John Gamble","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn it back to Jeff Dodge for closing remarks. ","Jeff Dodge","Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their time and their interest. And with that, operator, we'll terminate the call.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead sir","Jeff Dodge","Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge, with Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC including the 2015 Form 10-K and our subsequent filings. During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS excludes acquisition related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. Adjusted EBITDA margin in defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our Web site. Also refer to the investor presentations which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our Web site for further details.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks as always for joining us this morning on the call. Our first quarter performance certainly exceeded our expectations and further underscores the strength and the ability of this management team to consistently deliver results that meet or exceed the commitments we make to you our shareholders.","And not only do we have the experienced leadership team, but the entire organizational rhythm is geared to the Management disciplines we\u2019ve created and built together over the last 10 or 11 years. Those disciplines are NPI enterprise growth initiatives, lien, growth playbook, account management etcetera. I could tell you one thing, this team is hungry and competitive to continue the winning streak that they\u2019ve been on now for a number of years.","Our first quarter results are noteworthy as they\u2019re compared to a very strong performance in the first quarter of 2015. 2016 first quarter was a record quarter which is on top of a record year in 2015. For the quarter, total revenue was $728 million. That was up 12% on a reported basis and up 15% on a local currency basis from the first quarter of 2015.","Organic constant currency revenue growth was very strong, up almost 11% over last year. Also in the quarter, foreign exchange created a $19 million year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2% compared to 34.5% in the first quarter of 2015 and that was in line with our expectations when we guided for the full-year during our fourth quarter. [Indiscernible] and John will talk about that in detail, as will I, should you have any questions.","Adjusted EPS was $1.23, up 15% from a $1.07 last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range. As always, before John gives you the financial details, I\u2019d like to briefly cover some highlights for the fourth quarter. As I always do, I will talk about the business units, specifically first and then transition into some corporate level highlights. And then John will take the financials.","Starting obviously with USIS, they delivered solid 4% revenue growth in the quarter, double-digit growth in fraud, automotive, commercial, and mortgage resellers helped to offset slower growth in mortgage solutions, which as you know last year first quarter was really, really strong quarter for us.","New product innovation is expected to have significant impact on USIS\u2019s future growth, while some of this has been driven by Cambrian, the initiatives in USIS, like the Company are very, very broad-based.","Our current estimate sticking with USIS for 2016s class of new products are expected to have three-year revenue. That is double the estimate of our 2015 class. We'll talk more about NPI, at the Company level later on my comments, but it\u2019s off to a very, very good start for USIS.","Also the pipeline of new products is much more robust than prior years. Our current pipeline is estimated to deliver significantly more revenue, incremental revenue growth, reflecting both greater market demand and are increasing investments in products.","Cambrian, which you\u2019ve heard now about for a number of quarters. It\u2019s having a very positive impact with our customers. Since launching Cambrian, our mix of projects has shifted significantly towards multi-data sources and deeper insights from many of our customers, traditional decisioning activities.","Data extraction and analysis time have been reduced by well over 50%, what that allows us to do is fail fast and I\u2019ve talked before, it shortens the cycle time to bring new products to market.","Initial applications have addressed customer needs across diverse verticals, including banking, auto, telecommunications that\u2019s enabling us to leverage our entire customer base with unified technology and skill sets.","Our work with Fannie Mae on trended data is on track and is expected to go live as we committed to you earlier in the year. It will go live at the end of June 1 to July of this year. IT integration with Fannie Mae, an ongoing platform for trended data is complete and our global operations teams is in the final stages of establishing their support readiness program, again anticipating at the end of June early July launch.","USIS is expected to have another strong year in 2016, with growth at the lower end of the long-term range of 5% to 7%, despite our continued expectations for a flat to down mortgage market in 2016. EBITDA margins are expected to be at or above 50% for the year, which is slightly better than what we\u2019re expecting as we enter 2016.","On the international, they delivered 30% local currency revenue growth benefiting from broad-based organic growth, which was above the upper end of the long-term growth model which is 8% to 10%. The growth was also obviously contributed from the support of the acquisition of Veda and John will go into a lot of detail on that.","Within international, NPI has been and will continue to be an important growth driver for them. Innovation in international is very broad-based. For instance, in the first quarter, over 60% of new product revenue was driven by our customers\u2019 core decisioning activities. The remainder was driven by new solutions for high-value offerings in ID, authentication, data 360, fraud and debt management.","The relationship with U.K. government for our Debt Management Services is strong and the initiative is off to a very good start. We\u2019ve five central government agencies operational -- operationalized, including the HMRC, which is, as you recall, the equivalent to our IRS. And this represents most of the debt that has been placed for collections.","We\u2019ve placed over $800 million of debt with various agencies who are performing the analytics and the collections effort. Our data is fully integrated into the process of segmenting consumer and business accounts, to determine which agency is best suited to collect that particular segment.","Revenue in international's four largest verticals, which are financial institutions, telcos, government, and SMEs, grew a very strong 12% in the quarter, which is very broad-based across verticals and countries. The decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management revenue across international grew a very solid 19% in the quarter. These high-value solutions are deepening our relationship, customer relationships and strengthening our competitive position globally.","Many of you know we\u2019ve delivered very healthy double-digit local currency growth in Latin America for a number of years, and we expect to do so again this year. Although the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso have a negative impact on our reported results in 2016. It appears that Argentina's new government is moving in the right direction to restore credibility in the financial markets.","In fact, I just returned from Argentina and spend some time with our customers, government officials, and economists, and the outlook for Argentina in the next two, three, four years is as strong as I\u2019ve seen in my 10.5 years here.","Across the region, in Latin America we\u2019ve a very good management team, a very strong market position and our strategy continues to resonate well with our customers. Finally, the integration of Veda is going very well.","Our primary focus at this point is threefold. One is a thoughtful integration of the backroom processes. Two, deploying products and capabilities from around the Company that will add value to our local customers. And, three, ensuring that all of our customer facing teams in that region continue to service our customers well.","We continue to expect International to have a strong 2016. Organic revenue growth should be above the upper-end of their long-term model, again which is 8% to 10%, with EBITDA margins improving sequentially throughout the course of the year as planned.","On to Workforce Solutions, they delivered an outstanding 21% revenue growth and over 200 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in the first quarter. Workforce Solutions continues to grow well above the upper-end of our multi-year model of 9% to 11%. That\u2019s really being driven through strong execution of their core strategic growth initiatives which are adding records to the database, new product innovation, pursuing new growth opportunities in different verticals such as automotive, credit card, healthcare and government. The growth continues to be very broad based across many verticals penetrating new customers and offering new products.","Demand for Affordable Care Act solutions, known as ACA, with solutions for employers continue to be strong and our current outlook for the year is now ahead of the expectations we stated earlier in the year and you may recall those expectations earlier in the year expected very significant growth over 2015. So, that strength is getting even stronger as we move through 2016. We\u2019ve also identified other interesting opportunities to help employers with their ACA compliance. That includes things like the IRS Forms 1094 and 1095 and even beyond that.","Workforce Solutions is emerging as a leader in what could be called compliance as a service to help employers solve increasingly complex compliance matters. A suite of services has expanded and we continued to look for new opportunities to align our services with these emerging needs. An example that\u2019s an emerging need is new regulation coming out around overtime pay changes and we\u2019re looking at leveraging our ACA analytic platform to solve those problems as well.","EWS\u2019s NPI vitality index is expected to be very strong again this year, reaching approximately 13%. Their growth focus this year is on accelerating record growth in the work number database, deepening market penetration in targeted markets, again such as auto, cars, and government, and maximizing opportunities to help employers with their compliance needs. For it also continuing to solve employers\u2019 complex HR compliance challenges.","Workforce Solutions should have another outstanding year in 2016 with revenue growth well above their long-term range of 9% to 11%. EBITDA margins should be in the high 40s, just shy of the long-term target we gave to you earlier in the year of 50%.","On to Global Consumer Solutions, they also had an exceptional quarter with 16% local currency revenue growth and a 100 basis points margin -- 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Indirect revenue was up over 50% as the team continues to sign large deals with established companies who seek to deepen and broaden their relationships with consumers.","Our customers and our pipeline is robust across multiple industries, including banking, retail, consumer products and services, as well as our expanding relationship that we established last year with Credit Karma. Mid single-digit revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities was consistent with our expectations and largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the U.S and account acquisition outside the U.S.","Global Consumer Solutions first quarter performance was outstanding and we now expect that they too will comfortably exceed their long-term growth target, comfortably delivering double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year is expected to exceed 30%.","Before I go on to John, let me just give you a couple of highlights at the corporate level, and then John will give you the financials. Our enterprise growth initiatives are off to a very good start this year. Three of our four transformational initiatives are, one, developing the work number into a global exchange. Two, disrupting innovation by expanding our Cambrian platform throughout our global footprint; and, three, unifying our Global Consumer Solutions business with a single operating platform around the world that we call Renaissance.","Let me jump into each of those for a second. We\u2019ve already completed the scope and the timeline for creating an income and employment verification exchange in a select group of our larger markets. We\u2019ve the platform, we\u2019ve a strong customer demand, and we\u2019ll be moving forward with this effort throughout 2016 and beyond.","We are -- the initial focus for globalizing Cambrian will be in Canada, Argentina, and Australia. Canada will be the first; while other geographies will complete their initial assessment and define their requirements. We will give you an update on other countries as we exit 2016, but that bodes well for growth opportunities in \u201917, \u201918, and beyond.","Our global IT platform supporting Global Consumer Solutions, again called Renaissance, is expected to go live this year. After deployment in our core markets of the U.S, Canada and U.K., we\u2019ll evaluate other market opportunities, obviously including Australia and Latin America.","Cambrian has substantially enhanced our ability to provide unique, high value insights to our customers and it positions us well for the future. The platform can easily incorporate very contemporary analytic technologies, i.e., machine learning algorithms, analyze all types of unstructured data, and provide customers with dashboards customized to their specific needs.","In Fraud, we\u2019ve applied machine learning algorithms to increase prediction by over 20%, by reducing false positives or know your customer, anti-money laundering, we are incorporating unstructured data to reduce false positives by approximately 60%. For one of our large customers, we are providing them with access to over 50 metrics on over 3 billion trade lines from their customers. We have created a dashboard portal that will be updated on a periodic basis. These types of services uniquely enable us to further deepen our customer relationships and position us as the premier source of insights on their consumers.","Although in the early year, our new product pipeline for 2016 looks very promising. We expect year three revenue from our 2016 launches to be up significantly from 2015 product launches in their three-year revenue expectation, which as most of you may recall, 2015 class was up significantly over 2014.","Two very solid product classes will fuel growth through 2018. Our lien -- our work with our customers leveraging our operational experience with lien is creating great client stickiness. The activities we are helping our clients with are numerous and include such things as mortgage lending, collections, auto lending, marketing and employee on-boarding. So again, the activities are far beyond their interaction with us just trying to make their processes more efficient.","We\u2019ve also extended the program to International now and have either completed or have projects in the pipeline in countries such as the U.K. and Canada. We\u2019ve a number of clients where we\u2019ve repeat engagements, including two where we\u2019ve had five separate engagements at one company since 2014.","Increasingly client leaders making Equifax a trusted advisor in times of change. With these relationships we are able to increase utilization of our products and services across the enterprise, identify new customer opportunities, reaffirm the value of our products and services, and support and strengthen long-term relationships.","Our broad-based performance continues to position us very nicely to exceed the targets we set for ourselves and have committed to our employees, our customers, shareholders and consumers.","We\u2019re now ending the second quarter with strong momentum and in many respects have yet to fully realize the benefit of a number of these strategic initiatives that were expected to make meaningful contributions, not only to this year, but again to 2017 and \u201918.","With that, let me turn it over to John for the financials.","John Gamble","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I\u2019ll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As we indicated previously, with the Veda acquisition, we\u2019ll start focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the Company as a whole.","Adjusted EBITDA margin has been defined as adjusted net income plus depreciation, net interest expense and taxes. At the segment level, adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted operating income plus depreciation plus net equity and other income.","Given the change in our reporting structure, this metric will provide an improved understanding of segment performance as well as assessing their progress against our multi-year progress. The GAAP, non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin.","As you will recall, we\u2019ll be excluding Veda transaction expenses and integration expenses incurred through 1Q \u201917, the first year after the Veda acquisition from our adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA margin. In 1Q \u201916, total Veda transaction and integration pre-tax expense was about $22 million, virtually all of which was transaction related. $16 million of these pretax expenses are reflected as operating expense.","Of this $16 million, $12 million are investment banking, legal and accounting advisor transaction fees and impact general corporate expense. The remainder of the operating expense was acquisition related employee compensation expenses at Veda, which is included in the International operating segment.","Net FX losses related to Veda financing were approximately $6 million in the first quarter and are reflected as other income. As a reminder, we recognized $5 million in FX gains related to Veda financing in 4Q 2015. Looking forward, the remaining Veda transaction expenses will be incurred in 2Q \u201916 and should be relatively smaller, principally final legal and financial advisory fees related to completing required government filings and FX losses of approximately $3 million related to completion of the extinguishment of certain Veda debts.","Veda integration expenses will increase in 2Q \u201916 as integration activities accelerate. Total Veda transaction and integration pre-tax expenses in 2Q \u201916 are expected to be approximately $7 million, which includes the $3 million in FX losses.","Now let me turn to the business unit\u2019s financial performance for the first quarter. U.S Information Solutions revenue was $295 million, up 4% when compared to the first quarter of 2015, and consistent with our expectation. Online Information Solutions revenue was $218 million, up 5% when compared to the year-ago period reflecting double-digit growth in commercial information and fraud.","Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 1% compared to Q1 2015. Total mortgage related revenue in USIS was up 7% in the quarter, which compares favorably to the Mortgage Banker\u2019s Application Index, which was up 1% in the first quarter. USIS total mortgage revenue growth continues to outpace overall mortgage market growth consistent with their historic performance.","Although the mortgage market was slightly better than we anticipated for the quarter, our full-year outlook for mortgage origination remains the same as last quarter at flat to down slightly.","On to Financial Marketing Services in which revenue was $45 million, up 1% when compared to the year-ago quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S Information Solutions was a strong 48.7%. As expected, this was down from the very strong 50.8% delivered in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the very strong mortgage market in 1Q \u201915. In addition, this decline reflects increased legal expenses versus 1Q \u201815.","Legal expenses incurred in any given period can be choppy and excluding this increased legal expense, the adjusted EBITDA margin for 1Q \u201916 would have been down only slightly versus the record levels of 1Q \u201915.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $180 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Verification Services revenue of $99.2 million, up 16%, was driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto and pre-employment market segments. This reflects increased penetration with verifiers, as well as continued growth in records to the database.","Employer Services revenue of $80.9 million, was up 29% from last year. Our traditional Employer Services businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and on-boarding, performed well with combined revenue growth consistent with our long-term expectations in the mid single digits.","Workforce Analytics had a very strong quarter, as 1Q \u201916 and 2Q \u201916 represent the first in which employers are providing Form 1095-C to employees as part of their annual tax filings and as required by the ACA. As these forms are principally delivered in the first half of the year, we expect this strong growth in Workforce Analytics to continue into 2Q \u201916. The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.5%, up from 47.3% in 1Q \u201915. This reflects the very strong growth of our higher margin verifier and Workforce Analytics businesses.","Revenue from our combined USIS and Workforce Solutions businesses, which represent our total U.S B2B business activities, was $475 million, representing organic growth of over 10%. International\u2019s revenue was $158 million, up 17% on a reported basis and 30% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth, which excludes Veda revenue was slightly above our long-term range of 8% to 10%.","By region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $61 million, up 10% in U.S dollars and 15% in local currency. Latin America\u2019s revenue was $43 million, down 11% in U.S dollars, but up 15% in local currency.","As you probably know, Argentina\u2019s average FX rate in 1Q \u201916 depreciated almost 40% from 1Q \u201915. Argentina, when combined with the impact on the currency in Uruguay, contributed almost 75% of the negative foreign exchange impact on revenue in Latin America.","Asia-Pacific revenue was $28 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda, as well as revenue from net positive and our TDX debt management operations in Australia. Our current debt management revenue in Australia is very small. As a reminder, the Veda transaction closed on February 24 with Veda being a part of Equifax for about 40% of the quarter.","Canada revenue was $28 million, down 10% in U.S dollars, but flat in local currency. We saw continuing improvement in Equifax Canada during the second half of 2015, both in terms of revenue growth and, importantly, the pipeline of new products we expect to begin to deliver revenue later in 2016 and 2017. This flat performance in 1Q \u201916 reflects the relative weakness of the Canadian economy we referenced on our last earnings call. We expect improved performance as new products ramp later this year.","For the first quarter, International\u2019s adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, and as expected, down slightly from 1Q \u201915. The slight decline reflects the benefit of adding higher margin Veda, as well as improved EBITDA margin performance and debt management, which was offset by a decline in EBITDA margin in Latin America. This decline in Latin America is due to the substantial weakness of local currencies. A portion of our cost is in U.S dollars, which does not benefit from the devaluation of the currency.","Over the remainder of 2016, in International, we expect to show EBITDA margin growth reflecting revenue growth in our high margin countries coupled with the cost benefits of the regionalization program started last year.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $95 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 16% on a local currency basis. Global Personal Solutions showed growth across all channels, DTC, indirect and direct, and the strong growth in the quarter driven by -- principally by DTC and to a lesser extent our other channels. For the first quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 100 basis points from 1Q \u201915. This reflects strong revenue growth and leverage against GCS support costs.","In the first quarter, general corporate expense of $71.6 million was in line with our expectations and down 9% from last year. One-time items impacted both 1Q \u201916 and 1Q \u201915. As I mentioned earlier, Veda integration expenses impacted corporate expense by just over $12 million in 1Q \u201916.","As you will remember, in 1Q \u201915 we executed an organizational restructuring which impacted corporate expense by $23 million. Excluding these items, general corporate expense was approximately $59 million in 1Q \u201916, an increase of about $4 million or about 8%.","For the second quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million, including the Veda integration expenses. The adjusted EBITDA margin at 34.2% was down from 34.5% in 2015 and consistent with our expectations for the quarter.","The reduction reflects the expected declines in USIS and International that we discussed earlier, partially offset by very strong EBITDA margin performance at both Workforce Solutions and Global Consumer Solutions.","We expect to see year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins in each of the second through fourth quarters and continue to expect 2016 EBITDA margins to be approximately 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%, which was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted effective tax rate, excluding the tax impact of the Veda transaction integration expenses, was 32.7%. This was consistent with the 33% guidance we had provided. For the remainder of 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below this level, approaching 32%.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be at the high end of our long-term range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This reflects expected spending related to the integration of Veda.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $90 million and consistent with our expectations. Operating cash flow was down from 1Q \u201915 due to working capital movements. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow year-over-year for 2016.","Total debt in the quarter was $3.08 billion, slightly below our expectations. Yesterday we filed a Form 8-K with the required Veda financial information, as well as a new shelf registration statement which will give us the flexibly to take advantage of market windows to refinance a portion of the Veda acquisition debt.","As we indicated last quarter, we\u2019ll suspend our share repurchases during 2016 and focus on very strong cash flow and debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our target leverage. We\u2019ll, however, continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with a goal of delivering 1 to 2 points of additional ongoing revenue growth.","Finally, you will recall that in our 2016 calendar year guidance, we had indicated that we expect revenue from Veda of $220 million to $230 million, and that we expect a benefit of Veda to adjusted EPS of $0.10 to $0.15 per share.","In addition, when we provided our outlook for 1Q \u201916, we did not include any impact from Veda. As we indicated at that time, once we had completed the initial integration of Veda into our financial statements and had progressed in the transition of Veda to U.S GAAP accounting, we\u2019d provide an update to these estimates.","Based on the completion of this work to date, we are increasing our full-year expectation for EPS accretion to approximately $0.20 per share. Our expectation for revenue in 2016 is now $230 million to $235 million, which reflects improved growth expectations partially offset by a larger negative impact on revenue recognition from the movement to U.S GAAP accounting. Veda\u2019s performance in 1Q \u201916 was consistent on a pro rata basis with these expectations. Acquisition amortization in 2016 from the Veda acquisition is expected to be approximately $65 million.","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks, John. As I give you guidance for the second quarter and for the balance of the year, just to clarify, that does not assume any additional M&A at this juncture. So it\u2019s obviously the full-year of Veda in the numbers plus organic growth.","And as John alluded to in his comments, we\u2019re expecting to do additional tuck-in M&A this year. That\u2019s just not in the guidance I\u2019m about to give you. I wanted to make sure that was clear.","For the second quarter, we\u2019re increasing our outlook for both revenues and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue, including Veda, to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%. That\u2019s partially offset by 3% of FX headwind.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.34 and $1.36. That\u2019s up 17% to 18% over 2015. Excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 19% to 21%. With our strong first quarter performance and second quarter -- and outlook for the second quarter, we\u2019re also increasing our full-year outlook for the year.","We expect revenue, including the impact of Veda, to be between $3.05 billion and $3.15 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 17% to 20%, again partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is up from the previous guidance of $3.0 billion to $3.1 billion and will move us nicely above the high-end of our multi-year financial model of 6% to 8% organic growth.","And we also, as I mentioned earlier, expect potential additional growth through acquisitions as our pipeline is strong, but not included in that outlook. Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, which is up 14% to 17% year-on-year.","Excluding approximately $0.12 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth of 17% to 19%. This too is up from the $4.95 to $5.05 that we guided to during the fourth quarter earnings call a few months ago. We also continue to expect as John had mentioned, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to continue to expand by approximately 75 basis points for all of 2016.","So with that, operator, we\u2019d like to open-up to any questions we may have from our audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will the first question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Yes, thank you. Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations on the strong start to the year. I just wanted to first pick on, I think if I heard you right, you made some comments around trying to expand Workforce Solutions to other regions and you already had some increase in leads. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on that and what sort of timeline we should expect for some sort of replication of the data base you have here in those regions?","Rick Smith","Sure, Manav. It\u2019s an important part of our multi-year strategy. We -- as I alluded to in the prepared comments, we\u2019ve the technology platform exchange that will be moving to different parts of the world. We\u2019ve strong customer interest. We\u2019re going to be very focused in the countries which we go. That process is already underway. Places like Australia, Canada, the U.K. and India are ones that we\u2019re moving on right now. Think of it as a multi-year kind of contributor versus something where we all wake up tomorrow and there is a dramatic change. This is going to be a nice contributor to us. It is not contemplated -- when I talk to our investors and [indiscernible] and others about kind of multi-year financial outlook for EWS, that revenue was not contemplated, so this would be on top of that growth, which I have met with a number of customers internationally, as did Dan, when Dan was in the role and now as Rudy. And I can tell you the interest is very, very high and we\u2019ve the unique technology to do -- to satisfy those needs in those parts of the world.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess it seems like you emphasize the guidance, not including any future tuck-ins. Is that -- am I reading that too much into saying that there is probably a pipeline in the near-term we should see and maybe which areas we should expect that in?","Rick Smith","Yes, our pipeline is good. My whole focus to date has been getting Veda integrated properly. The team\u2019s focused on that, bringing products to Australia, New Zealand, and they\u2019re doing that. But at the same time, we\u2019ve a strategy. That strategy has resulted in a pipeline and we\u2019re moving forward on that. So, while it\u2019s not in the guidance, yes, to be very, clear, you should expect that we do a few strategic tuck-ins throughout the balance of the year.","Manav Patnaik","Again, and just last one for me, and it sounds like obviously there is a lot of internal momentum going on at Equifax. A lot of -- your peers are doing pretty well as well. Is there any -- I guess, could you provide some color on how we should maybe try and understand the high growth rates in terms of the extra cent coming from just macro tailwinds or industry tailwinds versus the remaining coming from just pure internal innovation?","Rick Smith","I think, our long-term model is 1 or 2 points of kind of market kind of growth. And as you know, the balance of the growth is we call initiatives, which are internal organic stuff. I\u2019d say the markets around the world are consistent with that model. We are not -- you are seeing some areas of good growth like automotive in the U.S but I\u2019d not say there is anything that\u2019s significantly changing the market dynamics of growth beyond the 1 or 2 points we talk about and have talked about for years. So, it continues to be largely driven by internal initiatives, including NPI, EGI, and others.","Manav Patnaik","All right. Thanks a lot, Rick.","Rick Smith","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","We will hear next from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to talk a bit about Workforce Solutions. Clearly the growth there has been probably surprising, leaving your own expectations. Could you maybe help us frame kind of what the TAM would look like there over, say the next five years? And then where you believe you\u2019re the most penetrated today versus just getting started?","Rick Smith","Yes, I continue to talk about EWS as being an unbelievable growth story for us, not just since we bought it nine years ago, but over the next 10 years. And I like to describe it, Andre, as being very early stages of its growth. What I mean by that is, we\u2019ve talked to you and others about our path to 300 million records and we\u2019re well on our way to that. That\u2019s a huge lever for growth. We\u2019ve talked about further penetrating verticals in the United States. And you heard John talk about great growth, broad-based growth in government collections, auto, card, mortgage, with the penetration level there it\u2019s so early, and it was many, many years of growth still to be had there. Third is the analytics. I alluded to that, John has alluded to that. It\u2019s growing dramatically year-on-year. It was a good growth driver last year. That\u2019s got a number of years of growth left in it. And then, we\u2019re now trying to take that platform and take it to other areas I alluded to, overtime pay is an example, IRS, 1094 and 1095. And then, lastly, it\u2019s taking the work number exchange and technology platform we\u2019ve and capabilities globally. So, when you couple that together, there are so many years of growth left in that business. Is it always going to grow with it -- what was it, 21%, John, in the first quarter? But we gave you a very robust multi-year growth, and I clearly expect that business for as long as I can see, to grow within that range that we\u2019re committed to.","Andre Benjamin","And then on the PSOL business, you mentioned you continued to sign more partnerships there. How do you think about the sequential growth rate for that business as the partnerships that you\u2019ve signed recently scale and you continue to add new ones?","And then, I guess, based on the list of partners that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve that you can continue to add to your list of partners, how do we think about how sustainable it is to keep growing above kind of the longer term rate that you\u2019ve laid out?","Rick Smith","Yes, I gave you the guidance for this year. It\u2019s going to be a very good year for PSOL. They\u2019ve signed up. As you know, we have a Credit Karma relationship from last year. We\u2019ve got another big player that I think has been publicly announced, they announced it last year in LifeLock. But then we\u2019ve all these other great indirect partners that these guys are signing up. So, I\u2019m very bullish for Global Consumer this year. They will be at or nicely above their multi-year model. And again, Dan is doing a great job now of taking that capability and not just looking at U.K., Canada, our two international platforms, but looking at other opportunities in other parts of our globe that we can take that Renaissance platform we earlier referred to, which is a core platform, and bring it to other markets and grow outside the current footprint.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you.","Rick Smith","Thanks.","Operator","Brett Huff from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff","Good morning, Rick, John, Jeff, and congrats on a nice quarter.","Rick Smith","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff","On the USIS, I think you walked through a little bit about why that revenue growth decelerated, but can you just give us more commentary on sort of that core business here in the U.S., both how you\u2019re seeing the macro maybe by vertical or something like that? And then also kind of what your innovations are really focused on there that\u2019s going to maybe reaccelerate that growth in the back half of the year?","Rick Smith","Sure. I\u2019ll jump in and John, if I miss something, please add to it. One, I tried to be very direct in my guidance when we wrapped up 2015, when I talk about USIS knowing that 2015 first quarter and really the first couple of months of the second quarter were very, very, very strong. I mean, the growth rate for mortgage in 2015 over 2014 in USIS in the first quarter was extremely strong double-digit. So we knew there was some headwind there. So, when I guided for USIS, or we guided for USIS, I said it would be at the low end, if not below the low-end of a multi-year range. So it came in exactly where we expected it and it\u2019s largely driven by those comps in mortgage. But it just remains very healthy. It\u2019s got those first two quarters of headwind that it\u2019s going to have to get through.","The great thing is we\u2019ve got great balance across the portfolio. Number two is, if you think of NPI, it takes a while to gain momentum. And they started building some momentum late last year, late to mid last year. That momentum is continuing now. So the number of products they have, like the rest of the Company, are broad across many verticals. Obviously, the one we\u2019ve talked about with the investors that will pay big dividends in the second half of the year is the launching of trended data for USIS. And that goes live, as I alluded to in the third quarter of this year.","So, automotive continues to be a good market for us in USIS; everything else I described is a stable economic environment. I think John did a great job. When you think of the U.S business, USIS, we separate two entities. We call one EWS; we call the other USIS. You think about many of the activities are going on when you compare ourselves to others in the U.S marketplace. A fair way to look at it, I think, for you guys is to compare either all of EWS in with USIS or you take the Verification Services and Analytics, which is healthcare, and look at it that way. When you look at it that way, as John said, you\u2019re getting double-digit growth. And that\u2019s the way we look at the business. We bring all of our products to bear to our customers and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an analytics for healthcare company, if it\u2019s a work number record or if its fraud, identity, management or credit file. They\u2019re all solving problems for customers in the U.S, and that\u2019s a strong, healthy, double-digit growth.","John Gamble","We saw great growth in identity and fraud all last year and again in the first quarter of this year, very good growth in commercial last year, and again in the first quarter of this year. So, as Rick said, very broad-based and not forgetting very high EBITDA margins. Last year\u2019s EBITDA margins were 51%, adjusting for legal, almost at that level this year. So, very, very strong performance.","Rick Smith","Good point.","Brett Huff","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just one other question from me. You gave us sort of the $800 million, I think, of debt from the U.K. that you\u2019ve been working through. Can you -- any more insight on sort of the ultimate size of that if you\u2019ve more line of sight to that? And any broad thoughts on economics to you all and how that revenue model might work as it evolves? Thank you.","Rick Smith","It\u2019s going well, Brett. So, overall the debt management platform, which, as you guys know by now, was TDX and it was this business we call Inffinix, which we bought in Mexico. So we are combining those capabilities; we are taking up those offerings global. So the growth rate is beyond just the government contract in the U.K. and we are gaining traction around the world. Hopefully we\u2019ll have some nice wins to report later on in the year outside of the traditional footprint. But specific to the government contract, it\u2019s ramping up as expected. And as John alluded to and I have alluded to in the past, as that revenue continues to ramp, the international EBITDA margins will continue to expand nicely. So it\u2019s on track as expected. It will be a nice contributor this year to the topline and profits.","John Gamble","And we just continue to caution people that given it\u2019s our first big contract with the U.K. government like this, that in terms of the level of growth rate, we\u2019re just going to have to tell you what the growth rate is going to look like as it occurs, because this is the first contract of this size we\u2019ve had with the government like this.","Brett Huff","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will hear next from Otto Garrett from Deutsche Bank.","Otto Garrett","Hi. Congrats on the great quarter. Just one quick clarification on your guidance for Veda. You increased the guidance for the year there to $230 million, $235 million. That\u2019s for the balance of the year? That doesn\u2019t include your contribution in the first quarter?","John Gamble","Now that\u2019s for the full-year. $230 million and $235 million is for the full-year.","Otto Garrett","Okay, great. And then also just looking at your relationship with Fannie Mae, saw a release earlier in the quarter that you guys expanded your relationship there to provide a monthly credit updates for their Connecticut Avenue risk securities? Can you just give us the size in there, like what the contribution of that might be?","Rick Smith","Small.","Otto Garrett","Small, okay. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you.","Rick Smith","Great. Thank you.","Operator","David Togut from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the superior performance in the quarter. Just a quick question on the Employer Services business, I\u2019m used to thinking about this business as being countercyclical and typically a slower growth business than the verification business at this point in the cycle? Is this because of the contribution you are now seeing from Workforce Analytics that you are getting this high 20s growth or are there other big drivers that would tend to, let\u2019s say, modulate the countercyclicality of that business?","Rick Smith","That\u2019s a good question and there is no doubt about it that the analytics push that we\u2019ve had is fueling great growth there and will continue to fuel great growth for the next couple of years, but it\u2019s also changing mindset. We used to always assume that the employer business was there to feed records into the verification side and it would be countercyclical. So if unemployment claims rise, that business would grow as it did in 2009, 2010. We\u2019ve changed our views there. We\u2019ve been investing over the years fairly heavily in platforms and capabilities. We changed the mindset of the leadership team there to think of it as a growth business. So, what you\u2019re getting is clear growth in analytics, but also growth in the core non-analytics businesses with an employer. Not at the same rate as analytics, but when you put the two together, you get really good growth.","John Gamble","And just specific to the first quarter, as we mentioned, right, excluding analytics, the other businesses grew mid single-digit, which is consistent with our expectation. So, great growth from Workforce Analytics. Please do remember, in general, Employer Services is stronger in the first quarter, because of work opportunity tax credits. The revenue there is skewed toward the front half of the year.","David Togut","Understood. Thank you. Congrats on the strong quarter.","Rick Smith","Thanks, David.","Operator","We will hear next from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","If I could first follow-up on that last one. So, you mentioned the forms related to the Affordable Care Act hitting in the first and second quarter. Is that -- How does the revenue model work for the Workforce Analytics? Is there a separate billing for that so the revenue would then fall off in the second quarter? And should that -- should we think about that as within the year-to-year growth calculation, or is the seasonality of that going to change a lot?","Rick Smith","Let me jump in. It\u2019s not the analytics that was unusual in the first quarter, it was the tax credits.","Gary Bisbee","Okay.","John Gamble","Yes, so Workforce Analytics, which is part of Employer, the general seasonality of their revenue will be higher in the first quarter and second quarter and then lower in the back half, specifically because the revenue model -- the revenue is generated based on the level of activity executed. And it\u2019s a deferred revenue model, right. So any revenue that -- any work that\u2019s done upfront prior to delivery of the product had to be put on the balance sheet and amortized over the period in which the product is delivered. So you end up seeing more revenue during the period of delivery, which is the first half of the year and less revenue in the back half. Was that the question you were getting to?","Gary Bisbee","Yes. So, I understand that mechanic historically, is that different now, because I think you referenced \u2026.?","John Gamble","No, it\u2019s just bigger. It\u2019s just way bigger, right. So the business is growing dramatically, so that dynamic is just bigger in the overall growth rate of the Employer Services segment.","Gary Bisbee","Great, thanks. And then, the bigger question, so you referenced the second straight year of sharply higher expected revenue from the innovation pipeline. Are there a couple of factors that have led to such robust improvement for the last few years and, I guess, what are they? I mean it seems like you\u2019ve had such strength, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the culmination of years of focus -- focusing on and talking about innovation or technologies changed or more places where you\u2019re selling multiple services. What are the key factors that have driven this? And is it sustainable or is it -- do you think you\u2019ve just hit a spot that\u2019s great, but then will normalize at some point?","Rick Smith","I think if you think about it, one, it\u2019s the maturation process. We\u2019ve been in NPI in the Company, I think, since 2006, so as you mature it just becomes more effective. Two, we launched, as you recall, NPI 2.0 maybe two years ago. We kind of revamped the enthusiasm, the approach towards NPI. Clearly, that\u2019s paying dividends as you get other -- more businesses into the game in a broader way. We talked that USIS now ramping up. We\u2019ve talked about Canada ramping up in NPI. And lastly, you can\u2019t ignore the fact that the technology platforms we\u2019ve invested in that facilitate the ability to build products faster, like Cambrian, building platforms like TotalView which allow our customers to consume multiple products quicker. So the combination of maturation NPI 2.0 plus the technology platforms like Cambrian and TotalView that we\u2019ve invested in, are all facilitating unbelievable strength in innovation around the world.","Gary Bisbee","And just one last one, how much of that also is the vertical expansion? Is that technology and what you just described more important or do you say today versus two years ago having a lot more progress?","Rick Smith","Yes it\u2019s great -- that\u2019s a great question, Gary. I\u2019d say, that\u2019s a really good question. What you end up doing when you verticalize the Company as we\u2019ve done in the last five or six years is you now have domain expertise in the vertical, so you\u2019re building specific products with great insight and knowledge to solve the problems in those verticals and we couldn\u2019t do that before. So, there is no doubt that having domain expertise in verticals facilitates greater knowledge and has faster or more NPI.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Operator","Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.","Tim McHugh","Most of my questions have been asked, but just quickly, I guess, the ACA related revenue after this first year push, how optimistic are you about being able to continue to grow on top of that or is this kind of a one-time step up as you look at it?","Rick Smith","No, Tim, it\u2019s not a one-time step up. It\u2019s -- and I tried to give you some text around that in the prepared comments, but it is a great growth this year. We\u2019re going to continue to expand the capabilities. I talked about 1094 and 1095 with the IRS. We talked about bringing the platform to overtime pay compliance; we\u2019ve talked about bringing once we get the work number up and running internationally, bringing the analytics platform we built for ACA in other parts of the world. So, now it\u2019s an integral part of our growth strategy for EWS globally.","John Gamble","And the customer base that we can apply the core ACA capability to is broader than we currently want. So there is more customers just within the core application.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And are you at this point, with -- I know there was a number of companies that provided ACA solutions for basically rushing to try and get fully implemented with all their clients in time. Were you able to do that or is there still even a backlog of clients you haven\u2019t, I guess, weren\u2019t fully implemented with that will continue to help drive the growth as well?","Rick Smith","Yes, there is no doubt there are other players in the marketplace. We think we\u2019ve a unique value proposition versus many of them, but there is some good competitors. Number two is the pipeline continues to grow. Number three is when the fine start to be levied to these companies later on this year, that can create an awareness and concern that\u2019s going to facilitate even a stronger pipeline as we exit this year and go into 2018.","Tim McHugh","Okay, thanks.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Operator","Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Toni Kaplan","Good morning. You mentioned that the Veda integration is on track. Just trying to think about how would you expect to see opportunity of building out the products in Australia will take, like basically cross-selling some of your products that you\u2019ve in other regions? I imagine it might be in multi-year endeavors, so just -- how should we think about sort of the incremental growth in the outer years?","Rick Smith","Yes, Toni, we think about the Company as being a very well-run Company, an established Company, a Company that\u2019s respected in the regions in which it play. So we\u2019re buying really good assets that\u2019s got good growth. We\u2019ve already given the Company a multi-year model for that which is at or above all multi-year organic growth model. Two, there will be some M&A opportunities as we get to know that part of the world better which add to the growth. Number three is bringing products like our fraud products, Cambrian, *TotalView, Interconnect and others, Work Number, PSOL, to Australia will help grow. Right now it\u2019s all about making sure we keep this asset focused on customers, get the backroom integrated properly, build a multi-year plan. It\u2019s not going to be a big bang on the transfer of products or knowledge. It will rather be a very thoughtful transfer of those capabilities over many years to continue to grow that business nicely.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, great. And just a big picture question, on the consumer monitoring space, how do you see that evolving over the coming years?","Rick Smith","Are you talking about the PSOL, the direct-to-consumer business?","Toni Kaplan","Yes.","Rick Smith","Yes, I think it\u2019s evolving as we expected and communicated in the past that\u2019s there will be a world of free and there will be a world of pay. Those two will coexist together. I think long-term the growth is going to be greater in the free, which means the paid model around the world will be slower growth, but still viable, still profitable, still growing.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Operator","We will move on to Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I appreciate taking the question.","Rick Smith","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Jeffrey","Rick, you certainly have a laundry list that\u2019s impressive of new growth initiatives. I wonder if you could just kind of rank order, perhaps -- I know you probably love all of your children equally, but if you could kind of rank order where you think the greatest or most potent levers are to maintain this nice above trend performance you\u2019ve been putting up.","Rick Smith","Thank you for the compliment. If I had to think about it over a multi-year kind of landscape versus a quarter \u2026","Andrew Jeffrey","Rick Smith","Yes, that would be helpful.","Rick Smith","EWS, clearly. I mean, my god, that is -- I don't know how else to describe it other than it has many, many, many years of very solid topline, bottom line growth. And we talked about it getting up to 50% EBITDA margins over some time and high growth that is just unbelievable. Number two, the other growth lever I love and Gary asked about it is NPI. And its refreshing that NPI combination with the maturation and the technology bodes very well for the next five years. Number three, EGI. We are really clicking. Andy and his team are on our enterprise growth initiatives, large complicated multi-business in multi-country growth objectives. That\u2019s got a lot of growth left in it. I\u2019m really, over multiple years, very optimistic about taking the Veda platform and growing it. With Work Number going global, I think it\u2019s going to give us -- as I said before, when I bought the Company, it will give us access to other parts of that world with great scale. We already have great scale. We\u2019ve people in that part of the region, so we will do some acquisitions there. Trended data is going to be important to us, not just for Fannie, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of analytics around the KS list; we are getting by different verticals. So, I think that bodes well for us. And then maybe lastly is continuing to look at different geographies around the world we want to expand.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And is the Employer information -- pardon me, the Employer information exchange, is that an important potential subset within EWS when you think about that broadly?","Rick Smith","Absolutely.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay.","Rick Smith","Again, bringing that to other parts of the world is going to be a nice catalyst for multi-year growth.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And if I may, on trended data, you\u2019ve got a lot of really nicely differentiated solutions. That\u2019s one area where perhaps some of your competitors are citing pretty good growth. Can you talk about whether your trended data is materially differentiated from the competition?","Rick Smith","Yes, I think so, because our assets are different. If you talk about the ability to trend utility database, who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend [indiscernible], who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend employment data, who else can do that? If you talk about the ability to trend income data? So, is the solutions we\u2019re providing for Fannie different than what TU is doing today? No, it\u2019s virtually the same. But the future is trending far beyond just Credit File, and that\u2019s where I think we are uniquely positioned.","Andrew Jeffrey","Terrific. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Operator","Judah Focal from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Judah Focal","Hi. Thank you for taking my call. A couple of quick bookkeeping questions. How much were the precise revenues from Veda in the first quarter?","A - John Gamble","About $25 million.","Judah Focal","Great. And how much was the tax credit contribution and how does that compare to last year in the first quarter?","Rick Smith","Are you -- Watsi, you\u2019re referring to an EWS?","Judah Focal","Yes, Watsi, exactly.","Rick Smith","I don\u2019t remember that.","John Gamble","I don\u2019t have that specific detail. So, Watsi was very strong last year as well.","Rick Smith","Year-on-year, I don\u2019t believe it was much different.","Judah Focal","Okay, fine. So it didn\u2019t necessarily contribute to the growth that much?","John Gamble","By far the biggest contributor to Employer Services Growth was ACA WFA.","Rick Smith","And then verification.","John Gamble","Yes.","Judah Focal","Okay, perfect. And then, just one final question just on Global Consumer Solutions. Has something -- what would you say beyond adding new partners? What would you say is driving this massive revolution in this space? This was a turnaround going back a year or so ago and we\u2019ve seen now tremendous strength in this. And not just you, but some of your peers as well. So, how would you characterize the change maybe perhaps amongst consumer awareness and willingness to buy some of your solutions? Thank you.","Rick Smith","Yes, sure. Thank you. Good question, Judah. So, one is we are -- we bought a company a number of years ago, TrustedID, and it takes a while to ramp up an indirect business. We\u2019ve done that now nicely. It took a while to get some momentum. Number two is we are partnering with some pretty good partners who are out there spending a lot of money, trying to advertise the product to the consumer. And obviously that builds over time; as they gain traction, we gain traction. So, it\u2019s a combination of multiple factors kind of coming together at one time.","John Gamble","On your first question, Work Opportunity tax credit revenue was slightly higher, the growth rate in first quarter \u201916 and first quarter \u201915. It wasn\u2019t a major driver, but it was slightly higher.","Judah Focal","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Up next we have Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, guys. Thank you very much for squeezing me in here. John, can you just walk through again the reason why the international margins were low? How much of the year-over-year difference was due to the currency impact by having your expenses in the U.S with the revenue and other currencies and how much were from some of the other things?","John Gamble","Yes. So, we didn\u2019t give exact numbers, right. But effectively the drivers were -- biggest driver was Latin -- in terms of reduction, was Latin America. So Latin America, because of the really substantial devaluation of currencies, which is much larger than we\u2019ve seen in the last several years. We saw a margin impact there that was planned, it was expected to occur. And that is specifically related to the fact that we do have non-local currency expenses and all local currency revenues, so that the margins just don\u2019t benefit on both the top and bottom line in the same way.","Canada margins were slightly down as well, because you saw Canada revenue was flat on a local currency basis, expenses were up slightly. So you had Canada marking down slightly, but the big driver was Latin America. And the positive side in terms of international margins that partially offset those declines were obviously the adding of Veda, because they had very good EBITDA margins. And then also, as Rick mentioned during his prepared comments and after, debt management grew and performed better. We took out some costs and we saw some better performance in overall margins in debt management. So, that -- those were the drivers of why you saw basically flat EBITDA margins in International.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And so, the growth you\u2019re expecting in the EBITDA margins through the rest of the year is a -- basically a revenue leverage item? Is that the way we should think of it?","John Gamble","So we will get some revenue leverage. We will also obviously get Veda for an entire quarter in the second quarter where we only had them for 40% of a quarter in the first quarter. And as we\u2019ve said, we are expecting to see some leverage in improved revenue performance in Canada as we move through the year. We are expecting to see also continued improved performance in Europe as we move through the year. So, generally speaking, the continued good revenue performance in International if you had for multiple years, we think it\u2019s going to drive some improved performance in EBITDA margin, as well as we are expecting cost performance improvements because of the regionalizations we started last year and we\u2019ve been talking about for the past year.","Rick Smith","Hey, Shlomo, Rick here. Just one other thing. [Indiscernible] back to 5,000 feet on margins, if you think of EBITDA margins. Just two points. One, I think you will agree, our EBITDA margin is starting -- this is for the Company now, at a very high level. But I think we are in the top 25% of the S&P 500 or so for EBITDA margin. Secondly, we\u2019ve committed to approximately 75 basis points on top of what is already very high margin for the year. We reaffirmed we will deliver that this year. All the way we deliver that for the Company is if the individual components, including International, continue to improve and increase. So it\u2019s important we keep that in context.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Got it. I\u2019m just trying to understand where it\u2019s coming from. Also are you having success in getting the ACA clients to put the income data into the TALX database? It seems like a huge opportunity to in the longer term?","Rick Smith","That\u2019s a great question, Shlomo. The answer is yes. And that success -- I\u2019ll give you some numbers in the past on these calls and that success will be further enhanced very shortly as we build a technology link that makes the transition from ACA into the Work Number database easier for our customers. So, that technology link and capability will go live in July of this year. Said another way, it\u2019s been a more manual, grind-it-out population of the [indiscernible] database from ACA clients. It will be far easier, more seamless for our customers starting in the third quarter.","John Gamble","Shlomo, just to make sure we are clear, since we are using acronyms, I was referring to EBITDA margin and that was the answer I was giving was around EBITDA margin.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Got it. Okay. But -- and so the ACA, we should start to see more automated process of porting income data into the TALX database in July? And is that going to become kind of a regular part of your contracting for the ACA stuff to be able to put that into the TALX database as a default?","Rick Smith","Absolutely.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","We will hear next from Jeff Mueller from Baird.","Jeff Meuler","Yes, thank you. So, I guess to continue the analogy from earlier, Rick, it sounds like you\u2019ve a lot of children and you love them all a lot. So you\u2019re sticking to the 6% to 8% longer term for now, operating above it this year, but it sounds like there is a lot of line-of-sight factors into \u201917 and \u201918 that you listed out. How do you think about sticking to 6% to 8% and within that framework, could you operate above it for several years at least?","Rick Smith","Yes, I feel good about it. That\u2019s why we gave it. As we get into -- back into this year, if there is something from a macro perspective or internally that would drive me to reconsider a different range above that, we will do that at that time. But at this juncture, I think if we can consistently, year in, year out, deliver 6% to 8% topline organically, another point or two inorganically, and give you some capital structure leverage, operating leverage, and a nice dividend and give 13% to 15% return to our shareholders, I think that\u2019s a pretty damn good model, year in and year out. And you will find years move up [indiscernible] as we did last year, as we\u2019re on track to do this year, but multi-unit's a pretty doggone good model, I think, and hope you agree.","Jeff Meuler","I absolutely agree. And then, on the relationships with the Credit Karma and the like, how are you expecting them to impact the market for credit card marketing or financial marketing? And is that an incremental revenue opportunity for you or is that within kind of the existing revenue relationship?","Rick Smith","I never quite thought of it that way. I think anytime they are out there in the marketplace getting consumers to be interested about their credit and that results in a product that we sell-through Credit Karma or LifeLock or something else a consumer buys, that\u2019s kind of contemplated in today\u2019s model and tomorrow\u2019s model. I don\u2019t think it changes the financial representation of the relationship terribly. But, to be honest, I\u2019ve not given it a lot of thought.","Jeff Meuler","Okay. And then just finally, do you guys -- are you willing to provide the verifications revenue growth split between mortgage and ex-mortgage?","Rick Smith","No, we don\u2019t break out that level of detail. But as John said, I think I may have said too, the verification growth, which I think was 16%, is that right, for the quarter was broad based. And selling verticals, I think John [indiscernible] auto, car, government, mortgage and others. And not only that, it\u2019s so early days of penetrating those markets, so there is many years of growth beyond mortgage. And guidance we gave for EWS assumes a flat to slightly down mortgage market for the full-year. So it\u2019s going to have really good growth with mortgage decline over the balance of the year.","John Gamble","Yes, we indicated mortgage, government, auto, pre-employment, all grew double-digit.","Jeff Meuler","Great. Thank you, guys.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the strong quarter. A question for you on one of the other growers there that was growing double digits, which is commercial. And we haven\u2019t really heard much about commercial since it was absorbed into USIS and I wanted to ask what was going on there? Is it specific to what you guys are doing or is it something overall in the market or mix?","Rick Smith","I would say it\u2019s a strong testament to leadership. And I mean that seriously. When we -- Brian, Tom, Madison, who is a seasoned executive for us and gave them, in addition to many other things, commercial and [indiscernible] in his past life when he ran USIS, those two guys rejuvenated the people, rejuvenated NPI within commercial. Strategically had a much different outreach, SPFE and\/or customers and leadership of those two guys and their teams have done a remarkable job of restating -- reinstating a growth mindset into a business.","Bill Warmington","And one more question on the FICO XD score. That\u2019s one where you\u2019re partnering with FICO and LEXIS-NEXIS and combining the utility data from NCTUE and the rental data from LEXIS-NEXIS. If you could talk a little bit about the revenue potential there for you. It sounds like it\u2019s potentially a premium-priced score.","Rick Smith","Yes, Bill, when you think of all the growth levers that your peers have referenced in past commentary, and if I were to list 10 of them, maybe 15 of them, maybe 20 of them, I don\u2019t think that FICO score would make the list. There are so many other great things that we are doing that you and I should focus on and others should focus on. And this is obviously important to us, that particular FICO score with LN data and our data is de minimus when you think of moving the needle for us.","Bill Warmington","Got it. All right. Thank you very much.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Operator","Your final question today will come from George Mihalos from Cowen.","George Mihalos","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in, guys, and let me add my congrats on a very strong quarter. Rick, wanted to ask you, you spoke, obviously, positively about trended data, but ground zero for that is going to be the mortgage market. Looking beyond that, what are the verticals or the areas that you think could be potential early adopters or really make a big push for the product?","Rick Smith","Three come to mind, automotive, card, and marketing, are the three that we\u2019re working on right now.","George Mihalos","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. The ACA analytics, as we look beyond 2016, given your comments on the strong pipeline, is it sort of safe to say that from an absolute dollar perspective you could have a similar increase in \u201917 versus what you are adding on in \u201916?","Rick Smith","I don\u2019t know about that. But here is what you should know is -- and no one has said it, , it\u2019s the pipeline is really strong; two is when the fines come out, that pipeline is going to strengthen. Three is we are going to take it to different areas like 1095 -- 1094 and 1095 for IRS. And, four, we are going to take that product to different areas we haven\u2019t even thought about before as we become a compliance center expert.","George Mihalos","Great. Thank you.","Rick Smith","Sure. Thanks, everyone, for your questions. Operator, I think that\u2019s it. Again, we thank everybody for their interest and the time today and with that, operator, we will terminate the call.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We thank you all for your participation."],"8871":["Equifax Inc.

These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in our filings with the SEC including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the third quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.","Adjusted EBITDA margin in defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.

Thanks as always for joining us. I start up with some high my level observations for the quarter for the corporation, dig in some details of business unit level. John will go through the financial details and I will come back with some closing comments before questions.","Third quarter was just another outstanding broad based performance by the team just really continuous to impress me. The growth we had in the third quarter accelerated on the first half of the year that added to our strong outperformance year-to-date. Our four business units continue to execute at a very high level, driving impressive expansion in our revenue, our adjusted EBITDA margins and the bottom line results. For the quarter, total revenue was $804 million, up 20% on reported basis and up 23% on local currency basis from the third quarter of last year.","Organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first half coming in strongly at 13% up over last year. In the quarter, FX created a $19 year-over-year headwind.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% compared to 34.6% in the third quarter of 2015 representing a very solid year-on-year increase and well above our annual 25 basis point target increase and well above our 75 basis point expectation we have for the full year of 2016. Adjusted EPS was $1.44 of 26% for $1.14 in the third quarter last year and better than our expectations when we gave third quarter guidance back in July of this year.","So let me jump into the individual BUs as always, I\u2019ll start with USIS, they had delivered a solid 9% revenue growth, significant acceleration from the first half, driven by broad based new product revenue including trended data. We can talk more about trended data in a second and we\u2019ll get into in Q&A as well.","Our tended data now is a reality. As expected Fannie Mae launched its desktop underwriter in late September. And as we indicated during our second quarter call, billing for credit data began in August for all mortgage related enquires. Revenue for the third quarter largely came in as we had expected.","We have a very good relationship with Fannie Mae and initiated discussions on trended data within nearly three year ago, we continue to see opportunities to work with Fannie and transforming the mortgage space including the announcement just this week for the launched of Fannie\u2019s desktop underwriter validation services which incorporates verified consumer income and pilot information from workforce solutions. We believe that will be a nice catalyst for continued mortgage growth for EWS going forward.","Additionally from our data and analytics team, they continue its efforts to complete a verity of analysis to access the lift from trended data for other decisioning activities. We\u2019ll talked to you about that in the past is really getting down the granular level by vertical by sub-vertical by day unique data asset understanding with the list. And trended data provide approximately 15% list in accessing prime accounts for open a home equity loan and a 20% lift in assessing prime accounts for default risk on home equity loans.","With the advent of Cambrian which we\u2019re familiar with, we now have an analytical environment containing over 18 months or more of historical data across many of our unique data assets. Today Cambrian is a non-production environment providing unparalleled ability to deliver compelling customer insights.","So today we are also building analytics and insights on trended data is 80 months or more including the credit file and other unique data assets in 2017 we\u2019re going to move to 24 months of trended data we have for the credit file to significantly beyond to 24 months in the production environment. I think outlook bring up a whole new room of opportunities to work with our customers and solve problems and we couldn\u2019t solve before.","Sticking with USIS, on September 30, we reached a long term agreement with SBFE to become a certified vendor. We now will be able to combine our CFN commercial financial network data assets with SBFE data to deliver best-in-class solutions for small business information customers.","USIS is expected to deliver revenue growth for the fourth quarter at the high end of the targeted range, which was communicated as 5% to 7%. And EBITDA margins will continue be above 50% in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","International, they continue to make great progress on its most - on their most important strategic initiatives while delivering third quarter local currency revenue growth of 60%, and organic local currency revenue growth up 10%.","In the quarterly, they reported adjusted EBITDA margins expendables by our 200 basis points from the year prior. The Veda integration continues to go well and remains on schedule. Some sub-hole underway, where we talked before our global platform deployment into Veda which includes close to Cambrian for Cloud platform are underway and especially be operational in mid-2017.","The NPI process has been established with the local leadership team and will be incorporating the Veda NPI revenue into our vitality index beginning in 2017. We\u2019ve also identified a number of opportunities to exports some of Veda\u2019s products to other international geographies.","Debt placement from the U.K. government is now up to 1.6 billion pounds and our performance year-to-date is exceeding the baseline performance we\u2019ve established. We now have all six founding agencies of the U.K. government boarded and have analytical projects underway with two additional agencies. For the initiative is still old in the early status, we\u2019re extremely pleased with both our relationship with U.K. agencies and the financial results we\u2019re delivering.","Organic revenue in international\u2019s five largest verticals, FI, telcos, government, retail and auto and aggregate was up 13% for the quarter. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew 19% in the quarter. These high value solutions continue to strengthen our relationships with customers and our market position.","In the coming quarters, we will be installing more sophisticated technology platforms i.e. interconnect our wholesale platform and Cambrian throughout our international footprint to drive future revenue growth. Canada continued to grow very good momentum with trended data. In the third quarter, we launched Cambrian platform which will further enhance our competitive position with best-in-class solutions leveraging trended data.","International is expected to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full year above the upper end of its long term model of 8% to 10%. Reported revenue growth for 2016 is expected to approach 55%, adjusted EBITDA margins should increase sequentially and exit the year approaching 30%.","Workforce Solutions they are strong momentum as resulted in another outstanding performance in the third quarter with 23% revenue growth and the 350 basis point expansion in the adjusted EBITDA margin. Total records in the work number database now approaches our short term goal of $300 million with over 6,600 different data contributors to that database. Our initiatives to further penetrate key verticals led a strong double digit growth in mortgage, auto, government and pre-employment enable few.","Revenue from four Healthcare vertical comprised an income and employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics for employers grew over 240% in the quarter. In the quarter, Workforce Solutions completed the acquisition of Barnett\/VJS, a small regional provider of employment and income verification and unemployment insurance services to further accelerate the growth of work number database. Early days that\u2019s going very well.","As I indicated earlier this week, no more color from Fannie Mae, they\u2019ve announced the integration of our full suite of employment and income verification services into their desktop underwriting platform. Employment and income verification services includes data from the Workforce Solutions, the work number of database providing instant and waterfall employment and income verification services.","With these services, unlike cycle times will be reduced and the lenders reliance on applicant providing W-2 pay steps or other income only documentation will be eliminated and this gives them protection should a mortgage now perform a protection of having the banks put the mortgages back to them. That\u2019s a great benefit for EWS.","Workforce Solutions has had an outstanding year in 2016. Both organic and reported revenue growth are expected to exceed 15% in the fourth quarter and 20% for 2016 substantially above its long term range of 9% to 11%. Adjusted EBTIDA margins are expected to be nicely over 45% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and high 40s for the full year.","Global Consumer Solutions continuously to make great progress on its strategic initiatives particularly building out a strong market position in both DTC reseller and indirect markets that include partnerships with the number of very successful companies that we\u2019ve talked about before such as Credit Karma, LifeLock, Harte-Hanks block and others.","We\u2019re pleased to announce we have executed a new longer term partnership with Credit Karma. The new and expanded partnership is focused on growing both of our businesses by leveraging unique data assets, innovation and analytics, including the use of our Cambrian platform and expanding our partnerships beyond the borders of the U.S.","This quarter, we deployed our new global consumer platform called [indiscernible] a best-in-class SaaS based ecommerce platform which provides much greater marketing flexibility to serve our partners. During the quarter, we successfully transition one of our largest customers to this new platform and by the end of 2017, we will deploy this platform across all portions of our U.S. business now will be well in our way to deploying across other geographies in which we operate.","Global Consumer Solutions is expected to deliver fourth quarter and full year 2016 constant currency revenue growth exceeding 15% with fourth quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA margin at approximately 30%.","Few high level points at the Corp level before John gets into the financial details, things we\u2019re talking about before those so important to our culture and our results. First is our enterprise growth initiatives which are our largest and most complex growth initiatives we have. They are performing very well in 2016 with revenue generation projected to be up over 35% from our expectations earlier this year and over three times the revenue generated from EGI in 2015.","Our overall performance in new product innovations, initiatives in 2016 is also outstanding. The three year revenue from our 2016 launches is expected to be more than 170% above the expected three year revenue from our 2015 launches. This is the strongest NPI performance we had since it was built and created some ten years ago.","Our vitality index that held last year and the pipeline of new products continues to be very robust. Today we launched approximately 40 new products and expect to launch another 20 products before year end.","In summary, our strategic initiatives continue to perform well and are head of our expectations we have at the beginning of the year. With this continued focused on improving the process allows us to drive continues growth, I expect these initiatives will continue to drive and deliver incremental revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.","So with that, John.","John Gamble","Thanks Rick and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis.","As a reminder, following to Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more-detailed description of what is included in the adjusted EBITDA margin.","Now let me turn to the business unit financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $317 million, up 9% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Online information solutions revenue was $230 million, up 7% when compared to the year ago period.","Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 39% in the quarter. The mortgage bankers\u2019 application index growth accelerated significantly up 35% in the third quarter compared to the 20% growth we saw in the second quarter. Given the much stronger mortgage market performance in 3Q 2016 and continued to accommodate interest rate environment, we now expect the mortgage market to grow solidly double digit in 2016.","Financial marketing services revenue was $48 million, up 3% when compared to the year ago quarter. Our commercial products, we grew 8% in 3Q. We have made great progress building the Equifax commercial financial network which includes straight line data from banking and other financial institutions similar to the SBFE as well as communications and utilities, wholesale trade, printing, publishing chemicals and allay [ph] products and rental on leasing data. When combined with Equifax consumer credit data, we can now opera substantially differentiated data analytics to our U.S. commercial customers.","Identity in fraud solutions also continue to grow strongly up 19% in 3Q and 23% year-to-date. USIS direct-to-consumer revenue principally our revenue with others CRAs was down over 20% in the quarter and largely in line with the first half.","The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions in 3Q \u201816 was 50.6%, up from 49.9% in the third quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $171 million for the quarter, up 23% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Verification services revenue of $115 million was also up 25% and continues to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto, pre-employment. Employer Services revenue of $57 million was up 23% from last year as well.","Revenue growth from unemployment insurance, I-9, tax incentives and other retail services was consistent with the annual model of mid-single-digit growth. ACA analytics revenue was up substantially in the quarter versus 3Q \u201815 driving much of the growth. As we had indicated previously, ACA analytics revenue was down sequentially and from the first half run rate. As expected, given that the ACA business is seasonal with higher revenue in the first half of the year went 1095s are delivered to employee.","The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47%, up from 43.5% in 3Q \u201815 and in line with our expectations. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions, our total U.S. B2B revenue was $489 million, representing organic growth of 13%.","International\u2019s revenue was $214 million, up 47% on a reported basis and over 60% on a local currency basis when compared to 3Q \u201815. Organic constant currency revenue growth was approximately 10%. By region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $62 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 16% local currency. We have seen some moderate impact on local currency revenue following the Brexit vote with selected large U.K. financial institutions.","Debt Management grew nicely in the quarter as our relationship with the U.K. government continues to perform as we had expected. The sharp depreciation of the British pound following the Brexit vote in late July significantly impacted U.S. dollar revenue growth in the region for the third quarter. The almost 7% decline in the British pound in early October will further impact 4Q \u201816 U.S. dollar revenue growth.","Latin America\u2019s revenue was $47 million, down 9% in U.S. dollars, but up 9% in local currency. The over 60% depreciation of the Argentinean peso from late December 2015 through March 2016 has negatively impacted the U.S. dollar performance of our largest and most profitable country in the region. Asia Pacific revenue was $74 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Canada continues to perform in line with our expectations including substantial improvements in the new product innovation initiatives which include trended data.","For the third quarter, International adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 26.2% in 3Q \u201815. On a constant currency basis, margins expanded over 300 basis points versus 3Q \u201815 and almost 50 basis point sequentially. As Rick indicated, 4Q \u201816 adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase sequentially and approach 30% in 4Q \u201816.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $101 million, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis. Growth again was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers.","For the third quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 30% in line with our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was down from 3.8% in 3Q \u201815 but up significantly from a 26.4% in 2Q \u201816 when we reporting LifeLock.","In the third quarter, general corporate expense was $52 million consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, total general corporate expense is expected to be slightly above $55 million.","The adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9%, up a 130 basis points from 34.6% in 2015. To strengthen adjusted EBITDA margins reflects year-over-year growth in USIS, Workforce Solutions and International. We expect the course 2016 adjusted EBITDA margins to be above Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin and our full year 2016, adjusted EBITDA margin to be up more than 100 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.","As Rick mentioned before, this is nicely above the target for 2016 of a 75 basis point expansion in our adjusted EBITDA margin.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter at 29.1% was below the anticipated level of 32.5%, which we communicated during our July earnings call. The lower effective tax rate reflects several discrete or onetime items which benefited our effective tax rate by over 3% points and our adjusted EPS by above $0.05 a share. Our current expectation is that Q4 tax rate will be approximately 32.5%.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $48 million and year-to-date are $131 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be about 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range as investments are made related to our integration of Veda.","Year-to-date, operating cash flow remained strong at $525 million.","Total debt in the quarter was $2.8 billion. We continue to reduce our leverage following a Veda acquisition which is now down at 2.58 times. Our target is to reduce leverage back to approximately 2.25 times EBITDA, which we expect to occur in 2017.","Now, let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard Smith","Thanks, John. I trust you agree 2016 has been an outstanding year for the company, strong and consistent execution throughout the company has resulted in a broad base performance significantly see the expectations we had beginning of the year. We firmly believe this positions us well for growth in 2017.","For fourth quarter currency exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $797 million and $801 million reflecting constant currency revenue growth of just over 22%, partially offset by about 2% of FX headwind as reflects organic growth over 12%.","Almost 7% depreciation in the U.K. pound in early October which charges John just referenced resulted in a majority of the incremental $6 million of FX headwind versus our expectations for the fourth quarter we gave guidance back in July.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be between a $1.35 and a $1.38, which is up 18% to 21% for the fourth quarter excluding $0.03 per share of negative FX, which reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%.","With this out, look our second half organic constant currency growth is approximately 12% and in line with the outlook we gave in the second half revenue growth during our second quarter earnings call which we\u2019ll recall as we guided to 11% to 13%.","For the year now, we expect revenue to be approximately $3.145 billion, reflecting constant currency were our growth of approximately 21% partially offset by 3% of FX headwind adjusting for the significant depreciation in FX principal to British pound, this is the high-end of the guidance we provided in July. This is also impressive performance by the team when compared to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, but revenue which you real we guided more than $3 billion and $3.1 billion in revenue.","Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to between $5.45 and $5.48, which is up 21% to 22% excluding approximately $0.14 per share full year negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency adjusted EPS growth of 24% to 25. This is up significantly from the guidance we provided in July and compares favorably to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for adjusted EPS with we remember was $4.95 to $5.05.","For the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand by over 100 basis points up from the previous expectations, which was 75 basis points.","As we look forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on a long term constant currency financial model of total revenue growth of 7% to 10% per year with organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%.","As we look to 2017 considering only the acquisitions closed today with sort of refresh your memory will be there in the small Barnett acquisition. We expect to achieve revenue growth at the high end of our total growth model. As this is too early to make a call on the U.S. mortgage market, this is soon to the U.S. mortgage market will be largely flat in 2017 and as always, we\u2019ll provide you more detail on our outlook for 2017 during our February call, but this point in time with the way the team is executing on the growth initiative of EGI and NPI will remain very bullish for activities in 2017.","So operator, with that John and I\u2019d like to open up the question for our participants.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thank you, good morning Rick, John and Jeff.","Richard Smith","Hi, David.","David Togut","Workforce Solutions continues to outperform my model both in the third quarter and indeed really year-to-date, could you comment a little bit about the hit ratio you're seeing as you approach the $300 million work number records in the U.S?","Richard Smith","Yeah, I mean just talk generically then get the specifics, you heard before we talked in the past David, the things going on by growth perspective started with slowly Dann Adams five, six years ago continuing and rolling now are just phenomenon. There are so broad based . If you think about it, the penetration which is one way to think about hit rate in each vertical continues to go up.","We continue to expand in the size of the database, continue to go to analytics on the data. Their growth opportunity and you know our long term model is very bullish presumably this is low double digits. Then their specific projects going on right now and continue to find ways to build the hit rate at work number of record. So generally speaking it is long term or highest growth opportunity business we have and we remain very bullish.","David Togut","And combined with that your EBITDA margin at 47% up 350 basis points year-over-year, now actually approaching USCIS EBITDA margin, how do you think about the margin expansion opportunity of this business over the next 12 to 24 months?","Richard Smith","Yes, as we\u2019ve talked in the past, this business - because of the great leverage we have most like the core USIS business are pockets of international, we get high incremental margin, especially in the verification side, but great things on the employer side at automation, enhance margin there. So there is no reasonable to believe that business over multiple years should not be approaching 50% plus our EBITDA margins.","John Gamble","Yes, our long term model as we gave in right is direct to the in the low 50s and we fully expected to get there.","David Togut","Got it. And then shifting gears to USCIS, mortgage continues to outperform and I thought your comment about next year and conservatively expecting flattish mortgage market. How do you think about the, what the Fed might do in the next couple months and how that might impact mortgage which has benefited from an incredibly positive environment with rates as low as they are?","Richard Smith","Yes, I expect we are financing to issue and when they do get, they are all over the board, that\u2019s what we said in February we\u2019ll give you better look. We have hopefully some better insight that juncture. You're saying rate is from one rate increase to two to three rate increases up to 75 basis points as well as 25 basis points next year, still historically low rates, you may see some softening in refinancing, but continues to see good strength in home equity and home sales. I think the thing we'll keep our eye on in general terms on mortgages affordability sort of pricing it is pricing go across the country and what\u2019s affordability index work like.","Beyond that there are so many great things we talk about that the team has done for, they done, I\u2019ve spent seven, eight, nine, 10 years which is outperform whatever the index does through penetration and innovation. And we talk about obviously trended data for Fannie Mae for USIS, we talk about the use now of the verification and employment, but it\u2019s just too small examples, but important examples of how we're trying to grow, we grow with the market does.","David Togut","Understood. And just final question on trended data, just trying to assess competitively where you stand versus your Chicago based competitor which is also been pretty aggressive here, you\u2019re seem to have a very deep offering, they may have a little bit of a time lead, if that's an accurate perception, but it seems like you have a deeper range of services coming to market in the next 12 to 18 months?","Richard Smith","I think I was trying to find a way around the trended data, we\u2019ve been very consistent with that. We were experience with out there first with batch trended there years ago. So clearly to you and that professional not the leaders, if you look at holistically to a batch and online, however we have moved aggressively have moved aggressively with years in all of our geographies to embrace trended data.","I mentioned in my call, we have the most unique date assets, it was not just credit file, we talked that over an 18 months of trended data in Cambrian or in a local environment that's many different data assets, it\u2019s now just to credit file.","And we're moving, you\u2019ll see this move dramatically beyond the 24 months of credit data that\u2019s trended in a production environment in 2017 well beyond even 30 months, which I think is a benchmark out in the marketplace today. So we're not handicapped in any, in fact I think we\u2019re leading in many senses on trended data.","David Togut","Understood. Thank you very much","Richard Smith","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Good morning, Rick. You mentioned 2017 are shaping up to be at the long term of a constant currency revenue growth range of 7% to 10%, I just want to check my math there that would be about two points of closed acquisition right, so we're talking 5% to 8% organic?","And the second question is at that level of revenue growth where margin expansion pays above the long term range for 2017?","Richard Smith","Yes, we\u2019re trying to say my word is there in total will be at upper end our 7% to 10%, so you can look what that means but\u2026","Andrew Steinerman","Okay.","Richard Smith","\u2026comfortably in the upper end of that range, so the organic growth by default as your math to two points have to be within the organic range to 16%. But we also have a very strong pipeline of other M&A things we can be doing tuck-in acquisition that makes sense to us in all of our strategic areas and geographies around the world. So we\u2019ve been very disciplined this year with only the small acquisition of Barnett. We should expect is to be far and doing strategic M&A on top of that next year. And the margin, our target is to deliver 25 basis points per year of margin expansion over multiple years, so you should continue to expect margin expansion next year in that range.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Firstly congratulations on another broad based quarter. I'm sure we\u2019ll keep asking you for updates in trended area and the corrections contract and so forth, but what I wanted to ask you is of these 60 new products that you\u2019re scheduled to launch this year, as we look at into 2017 and 2018 like what are some of the other products or initiatives we should be focused on outside of just trended data and so forth. It sounded like the fraud platform you said that launch at next summer maybe one of those. I was hoping you could give us a sneak preview at other stuffs we should be looking out for ?","Richard Smith","Thanks for that, thank you Manav for your kind words. NPI is so ingrained everything we do know. When you think about we're launching 50 to 75 products a year in this case 60 products. It's different by geography. Most of our NPI as you know tend to be singles and doubles of based up analogy. Everyone saw you hit some big ones like trended data. Fraud obviously is a very important growth opportunity for us in the international environment you talked, we talked about moving we call OSTRA [ph] around the world that will be a nice contributor. Mobile we\u2019re doing a lot now around the mobile world finding up ways to participate in the mobile environment, so that some great product launches planned later on this year and next year in mobile. 2002 is examples I can give you 100 more, but think about it, you can as you know we\u2019re so well. It\u2019s a lot of singles and doubles, that\u2019s what we win in NPI.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. And then just on the Credit Karma contracts, so I think in the past you gave us your revenue contribution from them I was hoping you could do that, that it does sound like the contract is much broader than what in the past, I think you guys were giving just reports and this course. I just wanted to confirm that if I heard that right. And in terms of expanding internationally when we heard from Credit Karma, the money 2020 conference, they mentioned Canada, but it\u2019s anything more than that you are referring to?","Richard Smith","Yes, thank you. We don\u2019t disclose Credit Karma to tell you this, it has been great partnership, it has been a wonderful win-win partnership for two years. We\u2019ve now sign a multi-year contract much longer term, we utilize our environment Cambrian, which is different in the past it will be focus on innovation. So building products at Cambrian in together it will focus on our unique data assets way beyond this is the credit file itself.","And then as you would tune your closing thoughts here you\u2019ll be going global as well and beyond Canada, our market discloses specific contracts, but there are some countries that they\u2019re very interested in and that we have a good market positions, good capabilities in, good data assets in together we both grow new business opportunities for us and consumers in those geographies is a really good, was a very complicated, long process, but the two team came to a great win-win for both of us for many years to come.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And just last question to me. When you start about this active M&A pipelines for some time now, I was hoping you could just characterize it in terms of the variance sizes of the deals you\u2019re looking at, because I think the one that you guys have rumor to be looking at in Australia, it seems a little bigger than tuck-in that I just was curious on, if you could give any color there?","Richard Smith","Yes, I think known to three years, if you think about my revenues here with on three large deals we talks nine and half 10 years ago we did CSC, we did Veda, the vast majority of anything else we\u2019ve done a small tuck-in to this that one, two points to go per euro is our model you should expect us to be in that range looking for small tuck-in acquisitions we\u2019ll aligned our simple strategy, and one, two points of growth next year.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, thanks a lot guys.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have George Mihalos with Cowen.","George Mihalos","Great. Let me add my congratulations on another strong quarter guys. Wanted to start off, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not going to size the impact in the quarter of the trended data mortgage contribution, but is it, is it safe to say came in somewhere ball parking in a little bit below a percentage point of overall revenue growth.","And then John, your comments on the margins for USIS, being I think at least 50% for 4Q, should we not expect a little bit of a step up from the 3Q levels given a full quarter trended data and then just sort of normal seasonality?","Richard Smith","Let me jump into first part and John if you want to address margin and I\u2019ll give you general fit on margin. It won\u2019t go to break out trended data for as this specific line item. But do you think of this way the - as we set up guidance back in July, the second half of the year, and specifically for the third quarter the trended data contribution for USIS came in largely as expected almost no material deviation from our expectations, it was performing as expect is fairly predictable for us a model that contribution.","As for as margins you\u2019ve got and you notice be a fluctuations month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter, there are mixed changes each and every quarter. The seasonality changes mortgage is lower volume in the fourth quarter, another quarter. So we put all together and I don\u2019t really worry about minor changes by quarter is really the multi-year trends in USIS start another very, very high margin trending.","John Gamble","And you see really nice growth in that margin obviously in the third quarter, good performance in the second quarter. So I think the margin performance is accelerating and you should expect to continue to see very good margin accretion in the fourth quarter. We gave a range of over 50%, but you\u2019ll see very nice margin accretion of fourth quarter as well. And again consistent, the company\u2019s delivered outstanding performance overall, as we said year-to-year, USIS as a contributor to that and we expect it to continue and we feel very confident in our long term model moving towards 40% in our long term model.","George Mihalos","Okay, great. Thanks for the color guys. And then just last question for me, as I relates to the","Credit Karma expansion anything we should be mindful of from a pricing perspective as we model the consumer services, the consumer division go into 2017? Thank you.","Richard Smith","Not, I descried really is an apples and orange contract. If we think the old contract there was one geography, one basic product in this, we alluded to this now multiple geographies, multi products and renovation. So it can be a growth driver for pro forma. It can be long term growth by process well.","Operator","And next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","Guys, good morning. As my first question, the lenders as we listen to commentary from large banks have been largely talking a lot about prime and super prime consumers, but I was wondering as you compare the roll out deeper analytic, how much your conversation is talking about the ability to Cambrian trended data, client data to get more comfortable lending to weaker credit consumer largely because I know when you frame trended data, you also talked about the uplift to prime loans with I don\u2019t know how but, what that\u2019s looks like for subprime as well?","Richard Smith","Yeah. It is good question. So the answer is yes. So are and have actively engaged in leveraging our unique data assets to give the underwriters more holistic view of risk. And that could be as things like leveraging the - that the income data we have are not model but actual that income you can be using our NC plus database which gives inside to how consumers will pay off their utility obligations, may I have a score, in fact many of Latin America the credit markets, we are leveraging alternative data assets there to help bring people into the credit market. So that\u2019s an active part of our strategy and has been for the quite some time and will be going forward.","Andre Benjamin","And more directly, is it fair to say that the uplift that you observe to analyzing some of those lower quality credits is the same or higher or lower relative to the prime bucket?","Richard Smith","It really depends on the vertical you\u2019re looking at and geography you are looking. The work you might get in a credit card offering versus an auto loan would be difference in different parts of the country as well and will be different depending how you want segment subprime from super subprime. So then there is something they want is there\u2019s no one generic answer to get back and promise this out of the teams the DNA teams. I mentioned in my prepared comments are deeply engaged with our customers around the world looking at ways to make this smarter underwriting decisions including subprime.","John Gamble","As far as that we launched using our alternative assets have brought a substantial number of additional consumers into the market where we can actually score them.","Richard Smith","I think I gave you too - pay too less that in my prepared comments two examples here.","Andre Benjamin","Yeah. My last would be, if I didn\u2019t miss it, where you stand on launching some of the verification process internationally and how that investment should impact the margins over the next couple of years?","Richard Smith","Yeah, great, great, I don\u2019t think I did, I also I did not address it in my comments, but yes, it\u2019s going aggressively. I think all the enterprise growth initiative which are systematic way to manage complicated growth initiatives. The international word number is being managed through that initiative obviously with the team and we got a handful of countries are very, very important to us is going out as planned.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Our next is question from Ramsey [ph] with Jefferies.","Kristin Dahlberg","Hi, this is actually Kristin Dahlberg standing for Ramsey. Thanks for taking my questions. So USIS had very, very acceleration from the first half. Is your expectations still for the segment to be at the lower end of the 5% to 7% range, I mean it seems like with the new products and with such a robust mortgage market there could be some risk to the upside?","Richard Smith","That you\u2019re referring to the fourth quarter or full year I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re saying next year or what you\u2019re referring to?","Kristin Dahlberg","For the full year I believe you prioritize had been to the lower end of the 5% to 7% range?","John Gamble","Yes, so for the fourth quarter we indicated we expected to be in the high end of the range. And for the full year it will be within the range absolutely. So, but first half starting slightly below the range, very good performance in the third quarter 9% we\u2019re expecting high end of the range in the fourth quarters only average those out will be nicely within the range for the full year.","Kristin Dahlberg","Right. So I think last quarter you guys said that that it would be at the low end of the range, but now where just going to be somewhere inside the range is that correct?","Richard Smith","Yes.","John Gamble","Yes.","Kristin Dahlberg","Okay. And my second question is there any way to parse out how much ACA has contributed a very robust growth within Workforce Solutions?","Richard Smith","Well, I mentioned in my first comments and this has been couple of years in a row now it\u2019s extremely broad based, I want in different verticals ACA as we called Healthcare which ACA is a part of than offering with a 240% year-on-year, it\u2019s a good contributor, but there are so many other things going on across EWS driving growth it is far more of just ACA.","John Gamble","And we give you verifier and we giving you and indication under growth of the other portions of employer, so there\u2019s quite a bit of information for you to do some analytics on that.","Kristin Dahlberg","And then my last question is, have you been any surprises on the data integration so far and is the expectations still for EPS accretion of $0.20?","Richard Smith","The answer to last part of the question is yes, and answer to the first part of the question is no, surprises I mean one time you buy a company you may have a surprise or never nothing material by any means. And it's going extremely well with we\u2019ll get numbers and view the team up here right now, team is down there. So it's your cultural integration will take as always does longer than process integration the acceptance from a customers of the things we can now bring to those markets has been wrongly receive, so all in all shown very well.","Kristin Dahlberg","Great, thank you very much guys.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni Kaplan","Hi good morning.","Richard Smith","Good morning.","Toni Kaplan","You mentioned the Fanny roll out of desktop underwriter integrating the employment and income verification. So when should we expect to see an impact from that in results and how could - how should you frame the lift that we should expect from that? Thanks.","Richard Smith","That announced it I think was Monday or Tuesday of this week just takes a while to get this system - the underwriters changing behavior to do so there's a lot of opportunity for further penetration across the mortgage underwriter market. We have not financially disclosed what the lift would be for EWS, but clearly mortgage is an important part of what the banks do, mortgage is an important part of those and should be a growth driver for more I would say start in late 2016 and 2017.","Toni Kaplan","Great. And then in terms of overall margins, in the past you\u2019ve given guidance target of about 25 basis points a year this year you'll be far above that as you mentioned in the earlier remarks and just what we've seen so far this year. Should we view 2017 as sort of a more normal year or would that still be elevated just given some of the large home run products that would still be flying through?","Richard Smith","Let\u2019s say we\u2019ll give you more insights to silicon margin in 2017 in February. Remember our overall goal is to get 40% EBITD margin so in the years ahead. So we\u2019ll give you more color on saving, if I\u2019d expect 25 basis points or so next year.","John Gamble","Again first to deliver on our long term model over the strategic period is kind of have to grow faster than that. And we're expecting - again we\u2019re expecting good another good year next year.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks lot guys, congrats on the quarter.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with R.B.C. Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to ask Kathy, ask about the breadths of the various factors that are contributing to the EGI and NPI success this year. I mean obviously trended you said is sort of an outsized relative to the singles and doubles in target, but if you were to look at what you've done without trended is the momentum been in line with what it's been the last couple years, has it picked up and are there how do we think about the breadth of it? Thank you.","Richard Smith","Hey Gary the kind of data as you may recall one life in August of 2016 and if you go back. So the EGI financial benefit and the NPI financial benefit are way, way, way beyond let trying do and now recall the exact numbers, but we talked about 2014, 2015 class of products in NPI being some more stronger classes in quite some time is not ever we talked about the full class in products in 2016 and with trends with one small part of that was up and shows your revenue some 170% above 2015.","We talked about EGI our enterprise growth initiatives Gary, it ups and flows in one year or maybe eight big initiatives to I think the highest number when we were saying is 12, 13, 14 initiatives and in this case trying to see there is one piece of all those - in my prepared comments I talked about that being up some 35% I think it was over our expectations at the beginning of the year. So turn the data is important there's so much more going on in this company line innovation and growth initiatives just trying to do.","John Gamble","And if you think about it every one to be used as the substantial EGI contributing, certainly you see front end in U.S. I ask you see in ACA and then other tremendous opportunities being delivered and Workforce Solutions the entire direct to consumer initiatives that you've heard about in GCS including the role out of the Renaissance\u2019s platform which we talked this quarter is the major driver in GCS, and THE great success in their management internationally driving growth also, right. So there's one in every BU as well ongoing success in NPI beyond that which is also substantial, so it's very broad based.","Gary Bisbee","Okay great. And then just a follow-up question I given how strong and broad the result momentum has been this year are there any points this early in the process that you point out we should think about is really tough comp areas or anything for next year and I guess I trying to think about phasing of the U.K. contract to do we see Europe slow towards how you've described the longer term and in employer services is there ability maybe at least comment on those two to grow on top of such strong growth with ACA this year and anything else you can think of it?","Richard Smith","Yes, there is a fact, you could talk in the micro stuff, but we go other micro head winds next year interest rate, I think they David Togut asked about. Mortgage - you said mortgage John was up strong double digit 25% or so, 30% this year. You should not expect and I said on my comments mortgage close to that next year and file to be could number. You always have the launches and for the challenge, Tray Walker [ph] and team have on NPI you have ramp ups of products and they do so right over some period of time with the next great product again I have been there for 11 years now, so that's nothing new.","So specifically one part one part of your question which is a U.K. contract you should expect that a ramp in the next year and it went live within full year this year or rather full year next year so we expect that to continue ramp next year. So that was contemplated in the framework that John I gave you we talked about guidance for next year and the long term total growth rate 7% to 10%.","John Gamble","And then we\u2019ve talked about Workforce Solutions and personal solutions that are both growing dramatically higher than their long term model. We said overtime they'll start to move back toward their model still with outstanding growth still next year growing incredibly well, but we had indicated they will start to move back forth their model overtime.","Gary Bisbee","Great thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Otto Garrett with Deutsche Bank.","Otto Garrett","Thanks for taking my questions. You guys have pointed out the strength that you\u2019ve seen within Workforce Solutions coming from your Healthcare or ACA compliance software this year, just as we think about going forward how much runway do we really have lacked as we think about 2017 are you likely to see the same kind of first half seasonality we saw this year?","Richard Smith","May go generic and specific ACS generically there\u2019s a lot room we left in EWS to grow, there is show many levers they have to grow, ACA is one component of that. I would expect ACA had the surge of ACA in 2015 and 2016, it depends on what happens with fines into fines the intention of employers and then say renewed interest by another surge.","Our expectation is ACA tends the module a bit going forward after two really good years, doesn\u2019t mean it goes negative or there's a problem growth the same rate has grown benefit 240% in the third quarter, but think about the overall model of EWS which is strong, strong up to single to low double digit growth and actually continue for not only 2017, but well beyond that.","John Gamble","And in terms of the seasonality of ACA is the seasonal business there it's just from revenue recognition there's more revenue recognized in the first half and the second half because 1095 to deliver to employees in the first half, and of the way revenue recognition works you have to require - we have to record more of the revenue with the delivery of the product of 1095 then you do for the remainder of the year. So let\u2019s just accounting in terms of way revenue has recognized during the year.","Otto Garrett","Great thanks. And you mentioned that now you have \u20ac1.6 billion already processed through that contract U.K. government and you're looking at on boarding two more government agencies just to happen - I came to discuss like what that's going to do the overall pipeline for the amount of debt that you\u2019re going to be placing of the contract and where you are and what there already been scared?","Richard Smith","I alluded the fact there\u2019s early days right now Otto, not the primary focus right now is making sure we deliver the value proposition that the government expect on that \u00a31.6 billion and that \u00a31.6 billion grows great and we\u2019re saying our performance versus expectation from our prospective and our customers perspective which bodes well, but I continues that has effect because other A,B,C are doing some other data who want to break up the expectations at this juncture. We have more progress and the other agencies will be the first will you know that\u2019s gone.","John Gamble","You do have to remember that HMRS is a contributor now and there are by far the largest sources of that, right, so, yes.","Otto Garrett","Great thanks. And lastly just looking at your comments regarding the fourth quarter, you correct me if I misheard this, but I think you said that there is a $6 million incremental revenue headwind due to the depreciation in the British pound, now is that relative to what your expectations were when you last gave guidance in July or just want to think about how to frame that $6 million relative to your 4Q guidance?","John Gamble","The $6 million FX headwinds since we gave guidance in July so versus our guidance in July.","Otto Garrett","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. And that's all for me.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","John Gamble","And specific to the fourth quarter to be clear, the $6 million is specific to the fourth quarter not the second half.","Otto Garrett","Great.","Operator","Next we have Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, good morning thanks for squeezing me in your desk. Lots of good information on a call as usual Rick, wanted to ask about data just in so far as it seems year-to-date that perhaps it's outperforming the expectations you had when you been you close the transaction, will we just characterize that and then as you think about Cambrian and NPI and enterprise investments in the region next year, what\u2019s the sort of ballpark organic revenue growth we should be thinking about for Veda?","Richard Smith","As you mentioned Cambrian largely I take holistically when as expected maybe frankly slightly better than expected, when we talk about the increased discretion [ph] as one measure of that outperformance. As I mentioned in comments OSTRO was our flat platform and Cambrian and we will rolled out sometime mid way next year. I think about that as being in multi-year kind of the benefit. Yes, it takes a lot ramp that up and gain fractions I don't see significantly changing the financial performance of Veda in 2017.","Veda we talk about being organic growth within our range to 6% to 8% over multiple years, and other thing we talked about is that Veda gives us access to all new geography, we\u2019ll look over months and years to come it using that platform to acquire other strategic assets in the region that make sense for us.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And if I can dig in just a little bit more on the TVX government contract quickly, can you just talk a little bit about how much of the total debt you might be able to address over time given that some of it is in collectible?","Richard Smith","I\u2019m not sure. Thank about that.","Andrew Jeffrey","I guess $22 billion or so. And maybe that's the wrong way to think about the TAM on that contract and if so distribution in nation?","Richard Smith","We clearly not modeled for about quite that way, yes the universe of opportunities \u00a322 billion focused now and stuff that give us today, make sure is the right quality, right mix of that and our teams performing analytics at the right level to provide value that's to me case I'm a firm believer if you prove value to the customer in this case U.K. government they will contain to file ways to expand not only a \u00a31.6 billion up and get other agencies to contribute as well. So all over enjoy now is making sure deliver on the promise from the government.","John Gamble","As important to remember that those agencies do collect some of the debts themselves internally.","Richard Smith","Absolutely.","John Gamble","Right, and have the right to do the within the contract. So at this point it\u2019s unclear is to what that mix will be overtime.","Richard Smith","So when we\u2019re saying there is other \u00a322 billion they find a piece we think we get or analyst get add value they place that source so as we continue to add value and increase the risk on the collectability that give us more of it, don't think about doing all \u00a320 billion.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","Under the wire, thank you very much. Congratulations on the strong organic growth. So one question for you, on mortgage related revenue it look like it was about 18% of total revenue just wanted to confirm that first?","And then I think in your comment you mentioned that you view the mortgage market, your assumption for 2017 was at the mortgage market was going to be flat. So the NBA forecast that came at on Tuesday is projecting the 2017 market down 14% on a dollar basis, so assuming price appreciation on houses of maybe 6%, I get it to around 20% down in terms of unit volumes.","So I guess my question is the expectation that the higher revenue per unit on trended data and the Fannie Mae do you validation service is going to be able to and other products are going to be able to offset that expected to decline in unit volume that the rationale?","Richard Smith","Bill we don\u2019t - the mortgage business in U.S. is important for customers and is important for us. We told you we\u2019re in the range of 15% to 20% of revenue comes from mortgage related activities we\u2019re clearly still in that range we expect to stay that range by the balance of the year. If you go back and look historically at the mortgage banking index and forecast versus actual it's all over the board.","We take a series of economists including our own economists and analyze different trends and from that make assumptions we've build guidance for we're going to historically that was in the framework we just gave you a flat next year. We\u2019re going to allow lot more come February. All trying to do for you as you have big more year you can make your assumption we think mortgage market is going to do. We think at this juncture a market performing someone at flat range is reasonable and we've - the market has been a long for a number of years on low side and high side lot more in February that\u2019s a good starting point for us.","Bill Warmington","Okay fair point on the MBA forecast its\u2019 stuff. All right, well thank you very much and again congratulations on the strong quarter. Thank you.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeff Meuler","Hey good morning. How verifications services solutions of overtime and taken the things like more attributes collected you hit tightly on analytics maybe better leveraging the historical records, but if you could talk about innovation in that segment specifically and how much of the growth drives? Thank you.","Richard Smith","Yes, it's important. So as I think about it Jeff, its continue to - workers to database, it\u2019s continue to penetrate more and more verticals at deeper level when we talk in the past by the automotive, car and others been good penetration to lot room to go still room to go and penetrating the mortgage market. We just talked about launching verifications business on global basis that\u2019s early days that\u2019s now I think pays dividends three, four, five, 10 years down the world as along from great growth level analytics will be important with this well so truly very broad based.","John Gamble","Also there\u2019s been a lot of innovation and the way be obtain records and partners, right. So a lot of the investment has been around building our partnerships to get more records faster and also about the technology that we used to allow smaller employers to much more easily board their records aquabats [ph] so they get a benefits at a much, much lower cost.","Jeff Meuler","Okay, thank you. And then finally John, can you just comment on year-to-date free cash flow and the full year expectation?","John Gamble","Sure, so year-to-date free cash flow you think continues to be very strong, we\u2019re expecting to a have very strong fourth quarter. So for the full year we're expecting our free cash flow to be very, very good, you continue to be good as it has been. So little below where it was last year generally because in a year we have very strong earnings like we had last year, we pay out all of our incentive compensation in the next year it tends to drive down cash flow in the year following a very strong year, and we've got a little bit weaker working capital which we're working on to recover, so we're very strong free cash down.","Jeff Meuler","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi good morning, thank you for taking my questions. Rick, can you give a little bit more of an update on Europe, it looks to me if I normalize for the FX headwinds in the quarter on a sequential basis the European business seems flat sequentially understand that do you have good growth year-over-year. But I would have expected it that the U.K. government contract would have put in some work growth there. Can you talk about some of the dynamics that are going on because of Brexit outside of FX in Europe?","Richard Smith","Yes I have a numbers converted, maybe John does, but overall Europe continues to perform and year-on-year growth is good, and lot of things we are seeing is that the Brexit has create some uncertainty for the U.K. market and kind of a pause button if you will for some of our customers into a little slower in their activity there maybe we expected. But where that goes it's hard to say I mean it's still two year time on before the full exit.","But overall you think about the U.K. you think about Spain, you think about that universe which we operate the team has continued to deliver solid growth results in a very custodies environment.","John Gamble","And the pattern of our revenue sequentially is fairly normal with what you\u2019d normally see in Europe. Yes we\u2019re seeing growth in the U.K. government contract, but again it\u2019s not the largest piece of revenue we have in Europe, Europe obviously our traditional business is much larger. So we are seeing continued growth, but the pattern of revenue looks very normal for us.","Richard Smith","This is almost Spain continues to do some amazing things and deliver some great results largely by NPI.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay that's a good color. And then so where we in terms of being able to use the U.K. government as a model for other countries, is there enough data that you can able to prove that you can do it or do you feel like you need maybe another year or before you can take it out to some other countries like that?","Richard Smith","Well I think, I announced last quarter, the fact that we want a significant multi-year contract that would arrive this split on this year in the U.K. in Canada. So we're - we have operations in Australia, we have operations now in Central and South America specific to the IRS equivalents around the world. We're not yet attack those opportunities, we\u2019re attacking our traditional customer base with the analytics capability in many countries it's already revenue with force.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So from a government standpoint that\u2019s out there, but not as fast as it is in the commercial standpoint is that the way to think?","Richard Smith","We just stood up a global government vertical, so standing up now last in a couple months that global government vertical all of our capabilities to bear to the governments around the world that make sense including the debt management collects analytics platform of Inffinix and TDX. So it's not yet yielding revenue, because we had not yet intentionally focused on it outside the U.K.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Understand and then question I've asked you guys before just where do you stand in terms of getting some of your existing ACA clients to contribute their income data to the talk database.","Richard Smith","Yes they done a great job, and systematically I think we talk about it in the first quarter I can\u2019t remember when it was we talked about in technology that allows it to be easier for the ACA platform users to onboard their records to us. So that was launched sometime this year Jeff Dodge and his team member and that was roughly second quarter. That was on the second quarter of this year, so we had a technology capability and it is a contributed to date to the odd number of growth that we're seeing.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thank you.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","Next we have Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Tim McHugh","Yes, thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but just one, maybe Latin America if I missed it, but the growth it's kind of gradually slowed a little bit the last week orders, anything happening there, I guess that explain to that and any reason to expect that well accelerate obviously on a constant currency basis?","John Gamble","Argentina is our largest country in the region, obviously Argentina\u2019s GDP growth is negative this year. So their performance are little weaker, but now we don\u2019t think so, we think Latin America continues to be an opportunity for us to grow.","Richard Smith","Yes, one thing that Tim, that gives me great hope to Latin America, it\u2019s a great market forces as you know Johnson has been for years. I'm more bullish what the outlook for Argentina the government is doing locally in Argentina to fuel growth and the economist now see that that the projections for GDP growth for the outer years are stronger than a same quite some time. The projections for currency stabilization are better than that we've seen some time I guess another year, the forecasts right now we have for Argentina, John just alluded to is negative this year about a percentage, so GDP growth in the next three years the consensus forecast is between 3% and 4% GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 and 2018.","So we're in a good position in Argentina, we\u2019re leader in Argentina in all verticals, analytics as well the core credit business. So I think better days ahead in Argentina when you see that that you see an updraft in Germantown\u2019s Latina America.","Tim McHugh","Can you give us, is there any - would you be willing to tell us roughly how much in Latin America we should think about is coming from Argentina?","Richard Smith","It's our largest operation in Latin America more than size that is rolling.","Tim McHugh","Okay, thank you.","Richard Smith","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens.","Brett Huff","Good morning thanks for taking my question. So just two one, first of all, you\u2019ve already called the season in the high end of your long term revenue growth range next year, but even given that break, is there any product or segment that you feel particularly hopeful about that if there's upside to that outlook where might that come from?","Richard Smith","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one lever that on NPI EGI that gives us maybe at the business unit level. As I've said for quite some time EWS it's got the longest growth potential we have and now go through in 2017 as well. But the neat thing is the performance part as you\u2019ve seen so broad based comes verticals countries be used EGI and products. Might there be another big EGI that comes up or another big NPI may come up, I think mobile are some really interesting opportunity for us. I think fronted data, we are just a credit file offer some opportunity for us maybe will see this underwriter that\u2019s got rather platform that\u2019s incorporating the use of verification and employment that might provide from upside, but it\u2019s really is not broad based.","Brett Huff","Okay and then the second question is again all the bigger picture is you guys have done a good job of creating or buying a proprietary database is you kind of using conjunction with a credit card that differentiate your products, what is the next phase of that is there a particular database or type of data that you're looking to build or buy the next to US so the next telco credit filing anything like that?","Richard Smith","Yes we have in trade organization of the data analytics team is a strategy that's linked to each country in every vertical of the country. So we now stop people not generic answer might be in Argentina in the auto vertical is the data we want to buy a global partner with Australia might be something different there. So and that's a big core part of our strategy so we don't tend to vote on the forward looking basis which has that we want to build the right, but the one we have talking about you seen this is the work number is very strong global.","Brett Huff","Great, thanks for the time.","Richard Smith","Thank you. Jeff Dodge?","Jeff Dodge","Yes, I'd like to thank everybody for their time and their support and interest in Equifax. And with that, operator we'll terminate the call.","Operator","And that concludes our presentation. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8684":["Equifax (NYSE:EFX) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 26, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Richard F.

At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations, and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2011 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the loss on the deconsolidation of Brazil in 2011. Since our Brazilian operations were merged with Boa Vista on May 31, 2011, we also present revenue growth excluding Brazil to provide a clearer understanding of our revenue growth for those businesses that will continue to be reported in our operating results.","These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation and our investor -- various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab on our website for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. It's should be no surprise that we are quite pleased with our second quarter performance. We continue to execute well against our strategic initiatives, capturing available opportunities from a cyclically strong mortgage market while continuing to deliver solid non-mortgage organic growth that's consistent with our long-term business model.","Shortly, we'll update you on our full year outlook. But first, let's take a quick look at some high-level financials for the second quarter. Total revenue was $536 million, up 10% from the second quarter when you -- excluding Brazil. Total revenue was up 14% for the quarter and up 15% in constant dollars. Operating margin was 24.8%, up 130 basis points from a year ago and consistent with the model we have laid out for you over the past few quarters. Finally, adjusted EPS was $0.74 a share, up 21% from $0.61 a year ago.","Throughout 2011 and the first half of 2012, we have delivered solid non-mortgage organic performance with little to no help from the macro economy in most of the developed parts of the world. What we've been doing is focusing relentlessly on executing our strategic objectives, attracting and developing a world-class management team and leveraging our fierce determination to drive innovation and growth across the enterprise.","For the past 7 years, we have initiated a number of enterprise-wide programs, which have contributed greatly for a solid financial performance during a period of weak economic and business conditions and to our relatively stronger performance in the most recent quarters when economic and business conditions have been somewhat more stable.","You\u2019ve heard us talk about the following 7 points that I'll go through here in a minute, in the past. But what is important is with each passing quarter, these 7 points become more ingrained into our operating DNA, and we've become an even stronger company. I'll go through the 7 points now that we've been focused on now for a number of years.","Number one is an intense focus throughout the company on innovation and growth. Our NPI process simply gets better every day, and we are now developing new targets after reaching a best-in-class level of revenue contribution in 2011. You've heard us also mention our 4G teams, which draw upon some of our best and most talented individuals to develop strategies for opportunities that could potentially generate significant incremental revenue.","Second is our strategic pricing. Strategic pricing is a proven driver of profitability, growth and stronger customer relationships. Our products typically have a very high ROI for our customers. With our unique data assets, it's very important that we understand this value so we can price our services accordingly. In 2007, we launched this after hiring some of the best talent available to develop our corporate pricing strategy. Over the past 5 years, strategic pricing has driven significant incremental revenue for Equifax. By adopting a revenue management mindset, we've become more effective at pinpointing the right offer at the right time and the right price. Strategic pricing is a -- is driving greater pricing consistency and value for our customers while leading to greater value for Equifax shareholders and our bottom line.","Number three, we've also developed a valuable discipline and structure around getting the voice of our customer into every product offering. Through that process, the intimacy we develop with our customers gives us an edge in the design and development of unique, high-value solutions that will enable our customers to drive incremental revenue growth and profit. We've also become a more highly valued business partner and, oftentimes, are presented with opportunities that we wouldn't normally have because of these unique capabilities.","Another fundamental discipline is how we challenge ourselves to continually drive incremental operating leverage as we grow. This relentless focus keeps us from getting complacent in our thinking. Our global LEAN COE works closely with each business unit to ensure that we operate at peak efficiency. They also identify industry-leading best practices that can be adapted to the environment and integrated into our daily operations. LEAN is but one tool we use. We also have worked with customers and vendors to ensure that our interactions are the best and most cost efficient that they can be.","Next, our strategic M&A is an integral part of our long-term growth model, where our objective is to drive 1 to 2 points of incremental growth from strategic acquisitions. We have developed a very rigorous process of determining the value and understanding the risk of the acquisition, how they fit into our existing strategy, the incremental revenue opportunities and the most effective way to integrate them into our company and business units. We mitigate these risks through in-depth analysis and thought, always challenging ourselves in developing a detailed set of milestones that measure our progress.","Next is in the service business, the quality and depth of your management team is paramount. Our global human resources COE drives the acquisition and development of our talent across the globe. We have developed mentoring programs, identified high potentials who were given out-of-the-box challenges, giving us the opportunity to develop them beyond their current job and devote considerable effort towards rigorous succession planning.","Finally, Equifax has a strong commitment to its shareholders. Just in the last 2 years, through dividends and share repurchase, we have given back over 50% of our cash from operations to our shareholders. These disciplines are fundamental to how each of our business units operate and, coupled with our strategic initiatives, a large part of why we have been able to deliver consistent and strong operating performance in these uncertain times.","Now as I always do, I'll go through some highlights for each of the 5 business units, then turn it over to Lee for the financials.","In the second quarter, each one of our business units continued to capitalize on their respective opportunities. In USCIS, they, again, delivered impressive double-digit revenue growth while expanding their operating margin.","With some major contract wins in the government sector, Technology and Analytical Services delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to be very optimistic about the opportunities in this sector and believe we have the technology expertise to capture significant market share in ID management solutions.","We also had strong double-digit growth in telco, auto and insurance, further demonstrate the broad-based appeal of our solutions. We continue to deepen relationships with many of our financial institution customers by appending unique work number information to their portfolio reviews, particularly with credit card lenders. That's a trend we've seen now developing the past few quarters, driving great new incremental revenue for the work number and value for our customers. We're making great progress with our key account groups. We call them KCP. They are the 4 largest banks in the U.S. It's an organizational structure we put in a few years ago, and it's paying great dividends. That group is now driving double-digit revenue growth year-to-date and deepening our relationships through cross-selling products and services across the enterprise.","International continues to drive broad-based revenue growth, as both Europe and Latin America deliver double-digit local currency revenue growth in the quarter. New product innovation continues to be a key growth driver, with year-to-date revenues from new products launched in the prior 3 years coming in above our expectations. In the U.K., the team continues to win against the competition by focusing on customer -- on the customer and delivering high-value solutions to meet their business needs. We're also driving stronger market and client penetration with our Analytical Services offerings. During the second quarter, revenue from all product offerings that embedded our analytical capabilities grew strong double digits.","Workforce Solutions delivered record revenue and profit, driven by very broad-based growth across multiple market segments, continuing strength in the mortgage market and the acquisition of a year ago, DataVision.","Double-digit organic revenue growth in the government, auto and pre-employment sectors, in addition to mortgage, underscores the strength of our year-to-date growth in Verification revenue.","Year-to-date, DataVision is ahead of our expectations, benefiting from strong mortgage activity but also through new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers.","Finally, we are aggressively leveraging our strong market penetration by cross-selling additional products and services, which will further strengthen our customer relationships, particularly for those who contribute data to the work number database.","North American Personal Solutions had a record quarter and continues to improve its operating rhythm, growing its subscriber base, minimizing churn and launching high-value products. ARPU growth continues, driven primarily by the new Equifax Complete product suite. This suite of products provides such features as credit scores from all 3 bureaus, unlimited Equifax credit reports and scores, identity theft monitoring and debt repayment calculators. And this year, we finally introduced -- or we introduced a family plan version, which combines all 3 features for 2 adults and up to 4 minor children. Launched in the fourth quarter of 2012, customers for -- on the Equifax Complete Family products now account for nearly 50% of our subscriber base.","North American Commercial Solutions revenue was approximately flat in local currency for the quarter. In this uncertain economic environment, a number of key financial institutions demonstrated caution in taking on new customers by reducing new lending activity in the small business sector, causing overall transaction-driven revenue to flatten. In addition, project-driven revenue most often related to marketing campaigns for customer -- new customer product initiatives were also flat to prior year, as business clients generally are exercising caution in their discretionary spend. It's a trend that we\u2019ve seen now for 2 quarters in a row.","Again, another quarterly performance, executing against our strategic vision, which we fundamentally believe is right for this company, the markets we serve and the investors who depend on us to perform.","And now as always, Lee will give you the detailed financials.","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll be referring to the financial results generally presented on a GAAP basis. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.","Overall, business execution continued to be strong in the second quarter, and mortgage activity continued at an elevated level throughout the quarter. Three of our business units grew at double-digit rates, those being USCIS, Workforce Solutions and Personal Solutions. And our international business, excluding Brazil in the prior year, grew 9% in constant dollars.","Compared to the same quarter in 2011, for the second quarter of 2012, consolidated revenue of $536 million was up 10% on a reported basis and 14% when Brazil was excluded from 2011 revenue. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, constant dollar revenue was up 11% or 15% excluding Brazil.","Our operating margin was 24.8% compared to 23.5% for the second quarter in 2011, and diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.62 a share. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization and the 2011 loss on the deconsolidation of Brazil, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $0.74 a share, up 21% from $0.61 in the second quarter of 2011.","Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $230 million, up 19%. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $153 million, up 20%. Over 50% of the growth was broad-based organic growth, driven by new products, overall growth in transaction volume from existing customers and certain pricing actions implemented in the second quarter of 2011. The remaining growth came from the mortgage sector.","Second quarter online volume was up 9%, driven primarily by double-digit growth in our key client program and channel partners who resell our products primarily into the auto and mortgage markets. Average revenue per transaction was up 4% in the quarter.","Mortgage Solutions revenue of $41 million was up 51% compared to the second quarter a year ago, both mortgage reporting through new products and for transaction volume. And Settlement Services delivered strong growth in the quarter. Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $36 million, down 9%. Revenue suffered in both Credit Marketing Services and IXI as some large projects were canceled or moved to later in the year. Our market tracking indicates that bank card new account openings are only up modestly over 2011, following strong growth last year, as financial institutions evidenced some caution in their new account marketing given macroeconomic uncertainty.","The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 38.3% in the quarter, up 36.5% from a year ago.","Equifax international's revenue was $119 million in the quarter. Excluding Brazil, following its deconsolidation in the second quarter of 2011, reported revenue grew 4%, and local currency revenue growth was 9%.","By region, Latin America's revenue was $46 million. Excluding Brazil from the prior year comparison, reported revenue grew 7% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency. Growth, again, was broad-based across product categories, as Consumer and Commercial Information delivered high single-digit growth, and Technology and Analytical Services and Marketing Services delivered strong double-digit growth.","Europe's revenue was $41 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currency. Strong double-digit growth in Analytical Services, Personal Solutions and Workload, an acquisition we made a year ago, offset some weakness in our Information and Marketing Services segments.","Canada Consumer Information revenue was $32 million, down 2% in U.S. dollars and up 2% in local currency. And international's overall operating margin was 29.2%, up from 26.1% in 2011, reflecting primarily the deconsolidation of Brazil in the second quarter of 2011 and margin expansion in the U.K.","For the quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue was $115 million, up 20%. Verification Services, with revenue of $63 million, was up 42% for the quarter. Approximately 60% of our growth was organic and broad-based, with strong double-digit growth in mortgage, pre-employment and government uses. The remaining 40% of our growth came from the acquisition of DataVision in August of 2011.","Employer Services revenue was $52 million, flat compared to last year, as strength in our automated transaction services offset weakness in Talent Assessment and Tax Management Services, primarily due to lighter unemployment compensation claims activity. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 23.4%, up from 21.6% in the second quarter of 2011, largely due to the strong performance of Verification Services.","North America Personal Solutions revenue was $51 million for the quarter, up 12%. Continued double-digit growth in U.S. B2C subscription revenue and in Canada resulted primarily from greater penetration of our higher-value, higher-priced product offerings as well as from growth of subscribers.","Operating margin for PSol was 29.8%, up from 27.7% in the second quarter of 2011.","North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $20 million, down 2% on a reported basis and down 1% on a local currency basis.","Transaction-based revenue was essentially flat when compared to the prior year, as telecom and manufacturing sectors continued to perform well, but financial institutions pulled back on new lending in the small business sector.","As with the 2 prior quarters, project-related revenue declined, reflecting the weakening conditions for small business operators. The limited availability of qualified applicants, a lower rate of spend on capital equipment and a lower inventory level in anticipation of fewer future sales were major contributors to a significant decline in the Small Business Optimism Index reported in June, and right now, we're seeing the impact of that in corporate marketing efforts to small businesses remaining cautious.","The operating margin was 14%, down from 20.9% in the year-ago quarter, as the anticipated pickup in revenue did not occur as expected. Corporate expenses were up 25% compared to the second quarter in 2011 due to investment in enterprise-wide infrastructure and growth initiatives and additional incentive compensation resulting from better-than-expected revenue and profit performance.","And our corporate tax rate of 35% was modestly better than expected as a result of the slightly lower foreign tax rate and contributed $0.01 to company earnings per share versus our expectation expressed in the end of the first quarter.","Now let me turn it back over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Lee. Let me close briefly -- by briefly recapping the first half of the year and then share our general outlook for the second half, and I'll discuss some expectations specifically for the third quarter.","By any measure, we had an outstanding first half of 2012, with 15% revenue growth and 21% adjusted earnings per share growth. This performance was well above our long-term growth targets, aided by, obviously, a strong mortgage refinancing market in the U.S. and strategic pricing initiatives, some operating leverage initiatives in the first half and obviously continued great execution against our growth strategies across all business units.","As I kind of frame up the second half of the year for you, let me do this. Let's go back to our last earnings call. In the last earnings call, we talked about the total year coming in between 10% and 12% top line, with EPS growing at 2 to 3 points faster than that. Where are we today? We're now saying that our total year growth is slightly higher than that. Total year growth will be between 11% and 12%, with that same earnings per share acceleration of 2 to 3 points faster than the 11 to 12 points. So largely in line with what we talked about in the first quarter earnings call with slightly higher revenue. Why is that? As we sit here today, we now expect the mortgage refinancing market in the U.S. to be slightly stronger in the third quarter than we had anticipated on the last call. That'll give us a little more growth in the third quarter.","Now also, as you look the balance of the year -- and by the way, we expect the mortgage market, as we did on the last earnings call, to start to decline in the fourth quarter of this year, getting more in line with our expectation of our budget, which is double-digit decline year-on-year. Also, as you think about the balance of the year, we're going to be comparing our revenue in the mortgage sector to a much stronger third and fourth quarter a year ago. So we expect the mortgage market to be, obviously, growing at a slower rate in the second half of the year than it did in the first half of the year.","In addition, as we've mentioned before, we have now anniversary-ed some of our strategic pricing and operating initiatives that I've mentioned a few times. Consistent with this view and incorporating our second quarter actual results, our constant dollar full year outlook for individual business units has improved modestly. I'll go through those one by one now.","We expect USCIS to deliver double-digit revenue growth at a slightly higher level than we thought previously. Workforce Solutions is now expected to deliver double-digit growth for the year versus our last call where we said upper single digit. Personal Solutions is also expected to deliver double-digit revenue growth for 2012. Commercial Solutions, where we've encountered a much tougher business environment than we originally anticipated, will likely be in the low single-digit range for the full year. International, when you exclude Brazil, should continue to deliver low double-digit growth in constant dollar growth for the year. And again, for the full year, we expect the company, when excluding Brazil, to grow top line between 11% and 12% and for adjusted earnings per share to grow the additional 2 to 3 points that we talked about. And again, this outlook assumes mortgage remains stronger and in the third quarter returns to the budget levels, which is down double-digit for the fourth quarter.","For the third quarter, assuming current exchange rates and the continuation of the mortgage activity we experienced this past quarter, our outlook for revenue growth from continuing operations is between 9% and 11%, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be between $0.71 and $0.74 for the quarter.","Finally, an important scheduling note is on December 6, we're going to be hosting an Investor Day. We\u2019d love to have all of you come. We'll be at the New York Stock Exchange, as we did, hosted a few years ago, back in 2006 and '07. A lot more details to be forthcoming, but I wanted to give you a heads up now, so you can get this date on your calendar.","So with that, operator, we'd like to open it up for questions for Lee and I.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping you guys could break out for us what the overall contribution revenue was from mortgage. And how much of the 14% growth specifically came from that?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. The -- remember the long-term goal and range we've for mortgage has been somewhere between, say, 14% and 20%. We're in that range. It's somewhere over 19% for the quarter, and of the total growth, over 6% of it comes from mortgage.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, can you guys talk a little bit about the operating leverage that we saw in USCIS? I think, sequentially, your operating margins there were up something like 180 basis points. And you had contribution from mortgage, which should be...","Richard F. Smith","George, I'll let Lee address that. Let me go back to one point I think it's important for those on the phone to really understand. There is no doubt that the mortgage refinancing market is a benefit to us. It's important to understand, though, it's not just the market environment itself. And you've seen the story from us for a number of years. We're out there developing a lot of new products in the mortgage market, products we never had before. Dann Adams over at the TALX team at Workforce Solutions is taking his team and penetrating new mortgage customers that we've never sold to before, gaining more share of new customers where he had lower penetration in the past. So it's not just the market itself. It's things we're doing to become a bigger, better player in the mortgage market. So it's a combination of market and us. It\u2019s important that everyone understands that. Lee, you may want to address the leverage in USCIS.","Lee Adrean","Yes, George. In USCIS mortgage products, there's really 2 classes of products. One is we do sell credit reports through resellers to other providers who provide tri-merge reports. So when we get mortgage activity in that part, it\u2019s high margin. We also have the tri-merge reporting and our settlement services where we have third-party expenses in our cost structure. Those are relative to our average lower margin. The average of those 2 runs about 50% incremental margins on mortgage, so part -- one of the reasons you're seeing good leverage even though a portion of our growth is mortgage-driven is we do get a slight pickup relative to our average margin when we're growing in mortgage. Obviously, the pickup is stronger when it comes in some of our other pure information offerings.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Got you. And just last question for me. Lee, maybe you can talk a little bit -- the corporate expense line was higher than what I was looking for at least. How should we think about that expense line over the back half of the year?","Lee Adrean","Yes. I think what you've seen is that our corporate expenses are up -- they're actually up quite a bit in the first quarter, and some of that was a timing consideration. We're up about $7 million year-over-year in the second quarter. Some of the same factors are going to play through the rest of the year. I think if you think of it as being up $5 million to $7 million a quarter over prior year, you're going to be in the right range.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I was just trying to back in -- you said mortgage was 6%. I think acquisitions were around 2% contributors, and then we had a constant x Brazil revenue number of 15%, so that would imply you back all that out, you're running around a 7% non-mortgage constant organic number. First of all, is that right?","Lee Adrean","Dan, if I refined it just slightly, it's probably about equally 6.5% mortgage, 6.5% core and 2% acquisition. But yes, you're in the ballpark.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So if I look at that 6.5%, I think last quarter you're running at 9%. Prior to that was 8%. Prior to that was 7%. Prior to that was 6%. Prior to that was 4%. So this is kind of the first quarter where we\u2019ve seen this broken-up trend that you guys have had. And I'm just wondering what you would call out as -- that calls for that.","Lee Adrean","Well, one thing we've talked about in prior quarters is one of the drivers of our year-over-year growth were some pricing and operating steps we took in the second quarter last year and that were greater than the typical. I mean, we're always pursuing those kinds of opportunities, but these were a couple of things that were greater than the usual scale and that we would be anniversary-ing those largely in the second quarter. And that is probably the biggest single impact.","Richard F. Smith","But Dan, I think it's also important to put it into context with the kind of -- we've given, which is our long-term models at the core non-mortgage organic growth to be between 6% and 8%. You can have fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. I see no alarming trends anywhere. At 6.5%, that's clearly in the range we had expected, and I think you'll continue to expect to see that range going forward between 6% and 8% in the balance of this year and next.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's a good number. The -- I just wanted a little more clarity on the SG&A number. I know you talked about, I guess, sales commissions being up, but it was definitely a much higher number than I had anticipated. What else is driving that in the current quarter? And is that an elevated level that we need to be thinking about for the remainder of the year?","Lee Adrean","Yes. We have stepped up our investment spending in a number of corporate initiatives, particularly infrastructure investments. We have just recently done a worldwide conversion in our HR information system to one common system. We are in the process of investing in upgraded billing and financial reporting systems and are continuing to make some investments in reducing the overall risk profile through some IT investments to strengthen our overall infrastructure. So...","Richard F. Smith","And Dan, these are consistent investments we've been making and talking about now for a few quarters. It's always important to put this into context, too. These are not a massive enterprise-wide, best-of-business kind of investments. They\u2019re very targeted projects that will make us a better, more efficient business going forward.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 quick ones. The -- we've been hearing recently a little bit that some of the auto finance guys were moving downstream into subprime. I know that's very good typically for kind of the velocity of the applications that you guys get pooled. Is that something that you're seeing? Would you call that out? Or is that kind of one-off on some of the people we're talking with?","Richard F. Smith","No, we\u2019re seeing it. Auto is strong for us across the board, and going down market is a part of that contributor.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, Rick, could you just comment on the congressional letters that were -- in the New York Times, they were all talking about it. Your thoughts about what they're asking for?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. It's -- it was old news. I love reading it so many times, so many different periodicals. It emanated, yes, I think maybe a month ago out of the, I think it was called the Columbus Dispatch, where it was first written. And what you see now is a number of different newspapers regurgitating the same story. It's nothing new.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So this wasn't incremental. I got it.","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Operator","We'll go to Carter Malloy with Stephens next.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So first off on the mortgage questions from earlier, how much of that mortgage growth is in your 3Q guidance? Just trying to get a sense of the delta between this quarter and next. If you could maybe split out, one, the mortgage growth and, two, the deceleration headwind from inorganic from DataVision?","Lee Adrean","Yes, Carter, I'll deal with the first part of that. The -- we are expecting roughly similar mortgage activity in the third quarter. But if you think back to last year, the third quarter was when mortgage activity really picked up. So the first half last year was very soft. The second half is very strong. So the key comparison in the third quarter is relatively consistent mortgage activity but a much more challenging comparable. That means the comp -- the contribution of growth will drop by, I would say, 1\/3 to 1\/2. In other words, instead of contributing a little over 6%, it's -- in a growth for the company in the second quarter, it'll be probably 3% to 4%. But that's one of the reasons, when you think about the step-down in revenue that we have led people to over the course of this year, some of it's because of the pattern of revenue growth last year.","Richard F. Smith","Carter, repeat your question on DataVision. I missed that.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Sure, just that comes -- that rolls into organic growth this quarter as well in August, I believe you said, so what's the pointage [ph] headwind of that?","Lee Adrean","Contribution of acquisitions in the third quarter, I think, is probably going to be closer to 1% than the 2% we reported.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then on the PSol side of the house, continuing to see acceleration there and really good performance in that business. Can you give us some more color as to why you guys are continuously outperforming in that market and if we should expect that to sustain?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. In the latter part, yes, we expect that to continue as I [indiscernible] on the guidance for the balance of the year. Trey and his team have done a marvelous job of understanding ARPU, positioning new products, building new products, understanding churn, reducing churn. They have got great operating metrics to run that business. Subs are on the rise, so it's a -- done a great job, and we expect it to continue.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly on the commercial side. Looks like we're expecting somewhat of a pickup in the back half. Are you guys anticipating improved small business lending on the transaction side? Or are there just some projects that you're expecting to actually flow through?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. I don't expect any significant market-based improvement. I expect a little bit of execution, some more benefits from new products, some projects that we didn't get in the first half of the year to come in the second half of the year. So it's going to be a modest improvement, but the expectation is we get back to low single digits, mid-single digits in the second half of the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Lee, you like to speak about 25 basis points of margin expansion a year, eventually reaching a goal of 25 to 26 kind of in your long-term plan. Obviously, huge success in the quarter. We're at 24.8. So we're essentially at 25. Do we have to revisit this? Or is that still the expectation, that maybe we'll go from 25 to 26, 25 basis points a year? Or is that conservative now, given where we are?","Lee Adrean","No. I think one thing to keep in mind is that when we deconsolidated Brazil last year, we got a significant pop. So I think our outlook for this year reflects the fact that very strong margin improvement in the first half of the year is a result of those compares that still included the lower-margin Brazil business. And then I think we're really on trend over the next few years for that roughly 25-basis-point expansion. And one thing I'd point out, and you can really see it, we've had a couple of questions already this morning on the corporate line. We are making the kind of investments to create a platform as a company to support the kind of growth we think we can drive. Some of those investments are to drive that growth itself. Some of those investments are to create the foundation to support that growth. And to grow at the rate we think, we think the investment level we need is such that a margin expansion objective in the range of 25 basis points is the right objective.","Richard F. Smith","And Andrew, as we've said a number of times, I think it's always -- context is always important. At 25% margin, we're in the top quartile of the S&P 500 already. So it\u2019s a balance of doing margin expansion and top line growth. And I think it's a good mix, good balance.","Operator","We'll go to Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just to pick up on that thought about margins and the ability to continue to drive the expansion there. I was kind of thinking of it more from the other side, if things were to get materially worse from here, what levers would you guys have left to continue to protect the earnings per share growth from here?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I think we have a proven capability as we experienced back in 2007, '08, and '09 to cut costs rapidly and leverage tools like LEAN. We truly have a world-class LEAN operation here, Julio, and there's a lot more juice to be had in LEAN across business units and COEs across the world. So God forbid, if we go back into a significant meltdown like we did in 2008, this team has proven they know how to cut costs, and they know how to deploy LEAN across the company. So we would do that again.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just sort of on that more entire thought process here. Thinking about balancing some of the cyclical headwinds against those long-term targets that you guys have set. It sounds like there are definitely some drivers in your model that are sort of, I guess I\u2019m thinking of it more as countercyclical, maybe even secular in the way that they're contributing. Can you sort of parse out maybe the issues that you think will allow you to kind of power through from a top line perspective any cyclicality as we go forward from here, so pricing and the KPIs, for example?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. Actually, that's a great question. I think the key and the thing that's helped us thrive the last couple of years and to get through the recession before that is innovation. Our team is innovating. I think I mentioned in my opening comments, innovating extremely high level now on the NPI and the 4G, strategic pricing, bundling products. That's at an all-time high. And the challenge I gave the team now is now that you\u2019re at kind of that best-in-class threshold, let\u2019s recalibrate. And if 10% of revenue goes -- coming from products that didn't exist 4 years ago, is today's result, what should tomorrow\u2019s goal be? And it's got to be something higher than 10%. So continuing that level of innovation and strategic pricing and bundling is key for us. The other thing, too, is to think about is we do have the benefit of having a diverse mix of customers, products, business units and geographies. And there's no doubt that's an advantage to us today and will be an advantage in the future as well.","Lee Adrean","And one thing specific, Julio, you may recall that our Employer Services or Tax -- particularly Tax Management component of our Employer Services business and Workforce Solutions grew at double-digit rates in the last downturn. It is very directly countercyclical. Obviously, the big drivers -- the strategic things we would do, but it certainly helps to have a $200-million line of business that's going to actually report stronger growth in that environment.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. We hate to see it moving up, but we understand it's on your model [ph] .","Lee Adrean","It's certainly not what I go home and hope for.","Operator","We'll go to Bill Warmington with Raymond James.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask a couple of questions about the online CIS. You mentioned that the revenue per unit, I think, was up 4%. I just wanted to ask for some color there in terms of unit volume and mix.","Lee Adrean","Yes. The unit volume and mix, well, the volume's up 9%, and our revenue per transaction on the specifically measured volumes was up 4%. We also had some benefits that get us up to the total 20% growth due to -- and some of the subscription revenue, some newer products that are priced on subscription basis, which are showing nice growth as well as some of our pricing shows up below the measured volume level.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then I wanted to ask also if you could talk a little bit about the dynamic you're seeing in the consumer financial products market in terms of what's happening on the demand side that you referenced around the consumer side and then also from the bank's point of view, the supply side in terms of wanting to put out those products in this environment.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, good question. I'll take that one. If you look at the core credit Marketing Services suite of products that we have and you exclude one particular customer, I\u2019ll come back to that in a second, they actually displayed good core growth in the upper single digits for the quarter. We have one customer, who's been a good customer of ours for a number of years, who's taking a step back financially and trying to reassess their financial capability and where they want to deploy capital, and it slowed down dramatically their purchase of products. And I think that's going to probably last through the balance of this year as they get their financial house in order, Bill, and then they'll come back in 2013. So the core CMS business is actually doing quite well. We're seeing an uptick in card as an example when you think of acquisitions. So it's really focused on this one particular client who stepped back.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then I just wanted to ask how the NCTUE+ database was doing, how those sales were going.","Richard F. Smith","Great. Very well.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You talked some about the pricing efforts anniversary-ing this quarter, putting some pressure on the growth rate. When you think of the long-term revenue framework of the 6% to 8% non-mortgage growth, how many points of that are you expecting to come from future pricing initiatives on an annual basis?","Richard F. Smith","We don't break that out, but it's important to make sure you understand, we talk about -- we're very proud what the team has done on pricing. And we always get better -- we talk about it being in millions of dollars significant every year. What we had this last year was a series of efforts, was very unique. And that unique large chunks of revenue that came through, I don't see that repeating, but we're always going to be out there thinking of bundling products, segmenting and ROI for our clients to make sure we maximize the price. We'll always get some but just not what you saw in the first half of this year and the second half of last year. So -- but we don't break that out specifically, Eric.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then it looks like the constant currency growth rates moderated a bit across geographies in your international segment. Is that being impacted by the pricing initiatives anniversary-ing as well? Or is that mostly due to the macro conditions?","Richard F. Smith","No, the pricing initiatives that I referred to that were kind of unique, if you will, that were anniversary-ed are the U.S. Just what you're just seeing is a slight moderation in the macroeconomic environment around the world. But it\u2019s still very healthy.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then could you just remind us again about that appending unique work number trend that you're seeing?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, what we\u2019re doing with the work number is we\u2019re working with the large banks and taking attributes off of the work number file or records and appending those to the credit file or the card issuers, and it's helping them make better decisions. So it's not entire work number that's appended. It attributes off of the work number file appended to the credit file, and then the card issuers are using that to make better decisions. It's really exciting.","Operator","We'll go to David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us an update, Rick, on the progress with the Boa Vista merger? I guess specifically, where does the joint business stand financially? And when do you expect to reach profitability in Brazil?","Richard F. Smith","We're spending a lot of time with that group, with or partner TMG, with Boa Vista, with ACSP down there, up here. We're doing best practices sharing, trying to now build the product capability we built here, NPI, integrating systems, and getting out in the marketplace, making sure the marketplace understands the value of the 2, getting the data assets. So across the board, it's going well. Culturally, as you know, it's a long process to get a new culture up and running. But I\u2019d say at this juncture, it's at our expectations from an integration perspective. As far as profitability -- let me back up. As far being received in the marketplace, David, the marketplace loves the idea of having a bigger, better, stronger, more viable competitor than we were separately. As far as financials and profitability, obviously, we don't consolidate that, so it's not fair for me to talk about their financials at this juncture.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Well, just in terms of understanding the financial impact of the business on Equifax, do you have a sense of when that business make start contributing to the profitability of your company?","Richard F. Smith","Well, there\u2019s obviously an opportunity at some juncture to dividend back, and we own, as you know, 15% of the company. So I think at any case -- and Lee you can jump in. It\u2019s a de minimis impact over the next -- where you're going to get the real impact is when we have the opportunity to increase our ownership from 15% to something far larger. But at 15%, a dividend back to us would be de minimis.","Lee Adrean","Yes, the comment on dividend, of course, with the 15% ownership, we're accounting for that using the cost method. The only revenue or profit we would recognize is our share of dividends. And we don't anticipate material dividends in the near term. They have some continuing investment opportunities in the business, so we would expect probably likely until we buy up in our position that the contribution to P&L is de minimis.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","When can you buy up from 15% and to what level?","Richard F. Smith","Well, there's -- as you remember, there's no magical structure to it. It's our desire. It's their desire, they being TMG, to exit and our desire to enter. So there's no mathematical formula, there\u2019s no predetermined timeline. When we think it's the right time and integration is fully complete and they think it's the right time from value, those negotiations will begin.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just final question. How much of the operating margin expansion in the quarter year-over-year was driven by the Brazilian deconsolidation?","Richard F. Smith","We talked last year. That would be about 100 basis points.","Lee Adrean","A little less because there was just 2 months in the quarter, so 70 or 80 basis points probably.","Operator","We'll go next to Jaime Brandwood with UBS.","Jaime Brandwood - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Wanted to start by going back to an earlier question relating to your use of work number data to enhance credit files in USCIS. Just so I understand it, when you\u2019re enhancing credit files in that way and then selling them to credit card lenders, are you booking all of that revenue in USCIS? Or does some of that revenue get booked in the Workforce Solutions division?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. No, when we append a work number, a series of attributes to the credit file, that revenue is recognized back at Workforce Solutions and Dann Adams\u2019 business, not USCIS.","Jaime Brandwood - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So that forms part of the kind of cross-selling benefits that the Workforce Solutions division is seeing, I guess?","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Jaime Brandwood - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking again at the underlying drivers to the Online Consumer Information Solutions division, looking more at the kind of change from Q1 to Q2, so I think in Q1 you've said your OCIS volume was up 16%, and now it's up 9% in Q2. And likewise I think your average revenue per transaction was basically flat in Q1, and now it's up 4% in Q2. Can you help us understand the changes from Q1 to Q2 that drove those changes?","Lee Adrean","I'm not sure there was any particular factor. I think we did see a little bit of a moderation in lending activity in the quarter. It is still -- obviously, still positive to last year but not quite as strong as the momentum we had coming into the year.","Jaime Brandwood - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But any credit reports that you would be selling to resellers that would then be selling those credit reports onto mortgage lenders, you would be booking that volume growth within that 9%. Is that correct?","Lee Adrean","Yes.","Jaime Brandwood - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just turning to your balance sheet. I mean, you're delevering pretty rapidly. Certainly, wouldn't expect you to comment on anything specific, but I'm just wondering generally as you think about your M&A pipeline, is there anything on a kind of 6- to 12-month horizon that might require a slightly greater level of investment that could see you relever that balance sheet up? Or is the M&A pipeline pretty empty at the moment?","Richard F. Smith","No. The -- we always talk about trying to deliver 1 to 2 points of revenue growth coming from M&A strategic acquisitions. That's currently our look as well, so I -- no need to deviate from that. Our pipeline is strong around the world.","Operator","We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is Steven Shui in for Shlomo. Just to get back to OCIS, can you break out how much of that growth was from mortgage and maybe how much of it was from NPI and a cyclical tailwind?","Lee Adrean","Mortgage is about 9% of online growth. Online was 20%. 9 points were mortgage. We -- as I said, some of the pricing and operational improvements that contributed were in the low single digit. What I would describe as kind of core growth was around 7%, and that's kind of a combination, roughly half and half between some new products and new customers versus just market growth.","Richard F. Smith","And Steven, as I mentioned earlier, maybe you heard it's -- when you think of mortgage, you can't just think of mortgage as the market dynamics itself. USCIS is a great example. We're going to be launching new products routinely in the mortgage space that didn\u2019t exist a couple of years ago, and that\u2019s fueling a lot of the growth as well. So it's not just the market itself.","Steven Shui - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then also to the commercial credit business, that didn't improve as expected, and it sounds like macro is a huge factor there. But were there any signs of intensifying competitive pressure or additional pricing pressure at all?","Richard F. Smith","No, not at all. There's -- as you might guess, we routinely look at market share, one business, lost business, price compression, price acceleration. No, it's just an overall more sluggish segment of our business than we had anticipated. But again, as I mentioned earlier, we expect that business for the total year to end up in the low single-digit growth. So we expect a better second half than we've seen in the first half.","Operator","And our last question will be from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Rick, you talk about, this year, EPS growing 2 to 3 points faster than revenue. When we look at all the puts and takes for the long term of tax rate, share repurchase, et cetera, do you think that relationship is sustainable? I mean, if you're putting up the 6% to 8% revenue growth that you talk about core, that earnings should be growing 2, 3 points faster than that.","Richard F. Smith","Absolutely. That's the financial model that we've thought through and built here and we communicated to our investors and to the sell-side guys. That's a -- through the combination of capital leverage and operating leverage that we get as a business, we should expect that 2% to 3% to continue for as far as the eye can see.","Lee Adrean","Andrew, one thing I would point out. You phrased the question in terms of 6% to 8% core growth, or organic growth, and 2 to 3 points of leverage on top of it. Of course, our model is 6% to 8% organic, on average, 1 to 2 of acquisition, plus 2 to 3 points on top of it. If we didn't do any acquisition, we'd get a greater -- we'd add that same growth through share repurchases instead of acquisition.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes. I'm just thinking about all the factors that can affect EPS in aggregate, just trying to triangulate to the sustainability of that. And tax rate was a bit of a tailwind in the second quarter. Should we think about the full year as still being around that 37% rate? I mean, the guidance maybe implies that the tax rate bumps back up in the second half.","Lee Adrean","I would say the tax rate for the year is probably between 36% and 37% but not the 35% of the second quarter.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Sure. So that's -- and that's probably the go-forward tax rate, somewhere between 36% and 37% as we look out into future periods as well.","Lee Adrean","Right now, I would say that I would tell you, if anything, the pressure on tax rate is probably slightly upward. States are looking for ways to add revenue, and many times, it's not major legislation and changes in tax rates but things they allow, disallow. And frankly, we're seeing the same from our friends in Washington. There's not been any major tax legislation but, boy, are they trying to disallow certain things that have been done in the past.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Rick, how would you characterize the contribution from NPI, rest of world, I guess Europe in particular? Is the momentum that you referred to in the first quarter continuing? And what are some of the things you can do to -- that can potentially maintain double-digit constant currency revenue growth, especially if the economic environment continues to deteriorate over there?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. I meant what I said. The -- I said a few quarters in a row now that the contributions of NPI are extremely broad based. It is not just every business unit. But specific to it -- to your question on international, it's every country. And international is running above 10%. You remember our goal was to get to 10% of revenue coming from products that didn't exist over the last 3 years. They're above that, so they're at the higher end and doing a great job. And that's why you're seeing growth in really tough economies like Iberia and the U.K. It's because of NPI, and the expectation is that continues.","Operator","And we have no...","Jeffrey L. Dodge","I appreciate everybody's time on the call. We'll be available throughout the day if you\u2019ve got any other questions. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trevor Burns. Please go ahead.","Trevor Burns - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including third quarter and full year guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2018, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, among other things, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and adjustments for uncertain tax positions.","Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to cybersecurity incidents, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance IT and data security.","This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our IT and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects.

These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release, and are also posted on our website. In the Form 10-Q to be filed later today, we will disclose the future losses from litigation and regulatory investigations are reasonably possible, but not yet estimable at this early stage in the proceedings.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks, Trevor, good morning. Looking at second quarter performance, overall revenue and adjusted EPS results were consistent with our expectations and a solid performance as we continue win back customers' trust following the 2017 security breach. Revenue of $877 million was up 2% on a reported basis and local currency basis and was toward the midpoint of the expectations we discussed with you in April.","As a reminder, back in April, we expected an FX benefit in revenue growth of around 1% and as you know that did not occur in the second quarter with some of the currency fluctuations which negatively impacted our reported growth for the quarter. John will discuss this in further detail later in the call.","Adjusted EPS was $1.56 and at the high end of our expectations. By business unit, Workforce Solutions and International performed very well in the quarter on a local currency basis and GCS was consistent with our expectations. USIS revenue was modestly below our expectations. However, they continue to make very good progress with customers further increasing the number of relationships where we are now able to pursue new revenue opportunities and I'll talk more about that.","We also made very good progress on the critical areas of our transformation including IT and data security and customer support which we'll also cover this morning. I'll start by looking at the BUs and start with the USIS. USIS revenue was down 2% versus last year and was below the 1% decline we saw in the first quarter and slightly below our expectations. This was principally in Financial Marketing Services and to a lesser extent in Online Information Solutions.","As we have discussed consistently over the past nine months, the critical strategic deliverable for USIS in 2018 is working with customers to complete their security views and most importantly win back their trust so that we can return to working back collaboratively to pursue expanded or new solutions that drive the customers' business forward and create revenue opportunities for Equifax.","Starting in the first quarter but accelerating into the second quarter, we made great progress in winning back this trust. We closely track the status of our largest 80 customers and with the substantial majority I mean, that a substantial majority, we are now able to pursue expanded or new solution opportunities with those customers. Or said differently, we are rapidly approaching a mode of being back to normal commercial discussions with the vast majority of our USIS customers.","Over the second quarter I met personally with a significant number of our customers across all the business units with a particular focus in USIS. As recently as last Friday, I met with two key customers up in North Carolina and I was back in North Carolina yesterday with another key customer. And consistently these customers recognize the value of Equifax, its differentiated data assets, the strength of our analytical capabilities driven by Cambrian, Ignite Direct and Marketplace.","Customers are ready to work with us to solve their business needs and with very few exceptions our relationship has returned to a more normal commercial discussion or commercial relationship, focused on how we can help them grow. Every week is a positive step forward for USIS to return to a more normal mode of operations.","As we discussed in the past, sales cycles in our business can be extended and are initially less predictable particularly following an unprecedented incident like the 2017 data security breach. Sales cycles historically could be as short as a few months for CMS offline transactions to as much as 9 to 12 months for online products, including customer integration both on their side and ours.","In the second quarter in Financial Marketing Services, we saw this impact on the sales cycle as the bulk of the decline in Financial Marketing Services was due to a handful of transactions we expected to close in June that pushed out to the second quarter. We do not believe these transactions are lost and still expect to close the transactions and have closed several of them already in the first few weeks of July. Importantly, we are seeing the USIS sales pipeline strengthen substantially both in Online and Financial Marketing Services. Given this strength we expect USIS revenue growth in the third quarter and second half of 2018.","As in the second quarter, I will continue to devote a significant amount of my time with Paulino and his team working with USIS customers as we return USIS to a more normal mode of commercial activity. We are intensely focused on this. We are intensely focused on returning USIS back to a more normal growth mode and it will continue to be a priority for me.","Turning to Workforce Solutions, the team in workforce had a very solid quarter with revenue up 7%, and importantly, Verification Services had a very strong quarter with revenue up 15%. Verifier revenue growth was broad-based with double-digit growth across government, talent solutions, healthcare and auto. The Work Number record growth was also strong which as you know is critically important. We had the largest sequential growth in active and total records since the second quarter of 2017. So great progress there by the workforce team. And as you know, our growth in The Work Number makes our data increasingly valuable to our customers.","As we expected, Employer Services declined in the quarter, principally in unemployment claims and our ATA-related businesses, workforce and analytics from the stronger U.S. economy and lower employment. However, as we look to the second half, we believe Employer Services overall will see growth as unemployment claims stabilize and we see growth principally in our Employer Services businesses. With continued strong growth in Verification Services and return to growth for Employer Services we expect Workforce Solutions revenue to accelerate nicely in the second half. Workforce Solutions continues to be an important strategic asset and growth engine for Equifax.","International also had another very good quarter with 8% reported in local currency revenue growth. Our Latin American and Asia Pacific businesses, as well as our European credit businesses all grew over 10% in local currency. Canada had a very strong quarter growing 8% in local currency.","As we discussed last quarter, our European debt management business is experiencing declines specifically in our venture with the UK government. As we indicated last quarter, the venture continues to deliver greater than expected value to the UK government, however, the UK government budget constraints have resulted in lower revenue in the first half than the prior year. We expect to see improved performance in the UK debt management business overall in the third quarter and return to growth in the fourth quarter of the year.","During the quarter I spent a lot of time outside the U.S. in Australia, Canada, UK, and Spain with our management teams. I'm very excited about the future of our International businesses. In Australia, we've seen a continuous success of our business since our acquisition of Veda. Recently the largest banks in Australia announced that by the end of the third quarter of this year, they will supply the credit bureaus with at least half of the comprehensive credit reporting data they hold, paving the way for integration of positive data in the credit file and better consumer lending decisions. We expect continued performance from Australia, as well as our International team in the future.","Last, turning to Global Consumer Solutions, revenue declined as expected 5% in local currency in the second quarter. To provide some perspective, our total U.S., Canada and UK consumer direct businesses represent just under half of our GCS revenue. The U.S. is the bulk of this revenue and as expected and as a result of the suspension of consumer advertising following last year's data security breach, the U.S. consumer direct business revenue declines over 25% in the second quarter of 2018, and now represents just over 30% of total GCS revenue.","Our partner business is now the majority of our GCS revenue and represents direct to customer partners principally Credit Karma and LifeLock, as well as our growing U.S. benefits channel business. Our partner business revenue is predominantly in U.S. and is a very important franchise for Equifax in our GCS business. Our partner business was up nicely in the second quarter both in direct to consumer and in benefits. This growth partially offset the large declines in our direct to consumer business, as we again did not advertise in the second quarter.","In terms of the future of our U.S. consumer direct business, and we talked about this before with you. We believe maintaining a broader direct relationship with consumers will be important to our commitment to substantially strengthen our consumer support in the U.S., as well as to our direct-to-consumer partner NPI efforts. We intend to continue to invest in our U.S. consumer direct businesses, and in the U.S. \u2013 in the U.S. and in UK, Canada and Australia. We expect to begin marketing in U.S. again before year-end, likely in the fourth quarter, and it's likely our level of marketing investment will be consistent with that which we had in 2016 and the second half of 2017.","Turning to our commitment to becoming an industry leader in technology and data security and consumer support, this is fundamental to Equifax and we've talked a lot about the significant investments that we're making in this area. We made very good progress in the second quarter on all those initiatives. We will deliver on these commitments through our IT and process transformation, but also critically through ensuring we have a culture that puts security and customer support first. Our enhanced government structure, with a new risk office and a leader responsible for strengthening our enterprise risk management is designed to fully support this commitment. This structure, utilizing three clear lines of defense is effective for our customers and was for me in my prior role leading Synchrony Financial and it will help us ensure the culture we're committed to will endure.","During the second quarter, we also made very good progress in building out the senior leadership team. You saw the announcement a few weeks ago with the addition of our new CTO Bryson Koehler. Bryson brings very deep IT, Cloud, and transformation experience from leading IBM's Watson and Cloud efforts and prior to that, the CTO of The Weather Channel. His deep product and cloud expertise, including experience in consolidating premise-based systems and transitioning them to both public and consistently private cloud environments is directly applicable to the IT transformation we have underway. Bryson joins our CISO Jamil Farshchi, who joined us in the first quarter, and Prasanna Dhor\u00e9, head of our Data and Analytics team to really round out a very strong IT, security, and data and analytics team that will really drive our initiatives going forward.","Jamil has already substantially strengthened our security team, bringing in leaders with strong technical backgrounds, as well as security experience. And I know Bryson is quickly off doing the same thing to really build out and strengthen our technology team.","I want to thank personally Mark Rohrwasser for his strong leadership as interim CTO (sic) [CIO] (00:13:57) over the past nine months. Mark did an outstanding job and I'm really pleased that Mark will remain with Equifax as the CTO (sic) [CIO] (00:14:04) of our International business unit.","You also saw the announcement last Friday of Paulino Barros stepping back in to lead our USIS business unit. You know Paulino well from his prior leadership roles at Equifax. He's been responsible for every corner of Equifax over many, many years. He's well-known internally and well-liked by our customers and the team across Equifax. Paulino is an outstanding operating executive and his depth of experience and focus on results, laser focus on results, will be a boost to us in USIS and across Equifax and will ensure that we do not miss a beat as our U.S. business continues its path to recovery and return to a growth mode. I expect Paulino to dial up the intensity and focus with the USIS team on driving growth and I plan to partner with him closely in the second half. We have the right team in place for growth at Equifax.","Our technology transformation is critical to our technology and data security and customer support commitments. And when fully implemented, fundamental to delivering revenue acceleration, speed to market and margin enhancements across Equifax. We're making very strong progress in accelerating our technology transformation as our technology DNA and security teams are executing on a transition to a standard global data-centric infrastructure, enhancing and extending our leading Cambrian, Ignite and Global Gateway and decisioning platforms with a cloud-first strategy.","As we accelerate progress, we now expect total gross non-recurring spending related to the cybersecurity incident in 2017, principally non-recurring project cost related to our IT transformation and security plan, which we've talked about many times with you previously, as well as legal and other professional fee to be approximately $300 million, up about $25 million from levels that we discussed in April. And we view this positively as we continue to invest in our business.","As we discussed last quarter, our new product innovation and continued investments in the expansion of Cambrian and our Ignite analytics and linking platforms globally remains a top priority for our entire team. Both are off to a great start in 2018, despite being impacted as we focus project management and technology resources on IT and data security. As we talked on the last call in April, we're focused on making sure we keep resources focused on our NPI initiatives. We worked diligently to keep those resources protected and we have an active pipeline of over 100 new products at various stages in the funnel and we're tracking to launch over 50 products this year, consistent with our track record of launching new products in 2017, and 2016.","As with all years, success in delivering NPI revenue in 2018 and 2019 will be heavily based on sales of products launched in 2017 and 2016. As we move through 2018, we're seeing a growing number of successes. Ignite Direct and Marketplace placements, along with the pipeline of new products are growing very nicely with both delivering revenue and enabling faster NPI with customers that adopt the platform. Our new Identity and Fraud products based on machine learning are gaining traction in the Card space. Yesterday, we talked \u2013 when I was with my \u2013 our customer in North Carolina, we talked at length about our new Identity and Fraud products.","In Commercial, trended data and trended database scores are also gaining traction and InstaTouch, which we launched in 2017, is also expanding adoption and was part of my discussion with one of our key customers yesterday. A second major card provider has now signed to implement InstaTouch and we've signed several other agreements during the quarter and the pipeline is very active.","M&A also remains an active avenue for growth for Equifax. We are building our pipeline and have completed several bolt-on acquisitions supporting Workforce Solutions in Latin America in the first half of 2018. You saw 10 days ago that we announced the acquisition of DataX, a leading U.S.-based specialty finance credit reporting agency and alternative data provider to lenders nationwide. DataX will become a part of USIS and their data assets will complement our core credit, telco and utilities exchange and The Work Number databases to further broaden the base of consumers for which Equifax can assist lenders in making credit decisions. This includes lenders in the installment loan, rent to own, lease to own markets. Additional DataX offerings included credit reporting, ID verification, bank account verification, and customer risk services are a part of those offerings. We are very excited about this new data set for our U.S. customers.","Stepping back, I have been with Equifax for just over 100 days. And as I mentioned earlier, I've spent over half of my time on the road, meeting with customers, partners, and also regulators to as rapidly as possible gain their perspectives on Equifax, while focusing on regaining their trust and confidence in us. As I mentioned, I was with a big customer in North Carolina yesterday and two customers last Friday. I'm spending better part of half of my time with customers with a big focus on our U.S. USIS customers. Their insights are incredibly valuable and overall very consistent. We have great support from our customers. They value Equifax's differentiated data assets. They are very supportive of our strong progress on security and technology, but they are also clear that we must execute on that data and security plan.","Given the events of 2017, the bar is higher for us, and we must deliver on our commitments to be a leader in these areas and we will. Our customers and partners have also been clear that Equifax data is unique, and our analytical capabilities are very strong and differentiated. However, competition is very aggressive, and to win our focus on the customer needs to be sharper. This will be a personal focus of mine, and the entire Equifax team going forward. Resources, both people and investment, are and will move closer to customers.","New product generation jointly with customers in a collaborative way through our DNA and NPI teams and commercial teams will be accelerated. This includes making access to Cambrian, Ignite and our data scientist easier, faster and more co-collaborative with our customers. Finally, our technology transformation will be prioritized to deliver speed of new products to customers. We are committed to returning USIS to competitive levels of growth and accelerating the growth of Workforce Solutions International.","I also want to ensure consumers and customers have my absolute commitment and my personal priority to making Equifax a leader in IT and data security and customer support, to ensure that we protect the sensitive consumer and customer data which we've been entrusted and to empower individuals to understand and manage their personal data. We've made very strong progress in the past nine months, since the security breach, but we still have a lot of work to do. Our focus is clear.","Stepping back, I'm incredibly excited about the path forward for Equifax. Very excited! This is a great business and a great space. We have unique data assets and insights delivered \u2013 solutions to our customers. We are making strong progress winning back trust and confidence with our customers as we return to a more normal mode of operations and we feel real momentum in our USIS business.","As I mentioned earlier, I will continue to spend a majority of my time with Paulino and the USIS team to accelerate the return of USIS to the growth path that it's delivered historically. At the same time, our big investments in IT infrastructure will deliver industry leading capabilities. Our significant investments in security will bring us to an industry leading position in protecting consumer data. We have the right team in place to drive this transformation and we are laser focused and energized around delivering in the second half, and the future ahead for Equifax.","Thanks and with that, let me hand it over to John.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. For 2018, additional items excluded from our non-GAAP results are the one-time costs related to the cybersecurity incident, and the one-time benefits for adjustments to uncertain tax positions. We will provide the details on this item so you can consider it in your analysis.","In total, in 2Q 2018, we incurred non-recurring costs related to the cybersecurity incident of $71 million. These have been partially offset by insurance recoveries of $35 million, resulting in net non-recurring charge of $36 million. The non-recurring charge is excluded from our adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. The $71 million of gross cost includes $16 million were generally for legal fees and other professional services, principally related to outstanding litigation and government investigations related to the cybersecurity incident and $55 million were generally for one-time incremental project and other costs incurred to implement our data security and technology plans and to improve our technology infrastructure.","Total non-recurring and one-time incremental project and other gross costs incurred year-to-date were $150 million and since 3Q 2017, related to the cybersecurity incident, were $314 million. We have $125 million of cybersecurity insurance under our E&O policy against which we have received the payments to-date of $95 million, which partially offsets the cost referenced above. We continue to expect to make claims to fully utilize the policy.","For Equifax, in 2Q 2018, as Mark indicated revenue of $877 million was up over 2% from 2Q 2017, both on a reported and local currency basis, and at the midpoint of the constant currency expectation we discussed in April. At the time of our conference call in April, our expectation was for local currency growth of 2% to 3%, with reported growth of 3% to 4% reflecting foreign exchange rates at the time which would have generated an FX benefit to revenue of about 1%.","Cash EPS in the second quart of $1.56 was down $0.04 per share from last year, and at the high end of our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.0% in 2Q 2018, down 410 basis points from the record 39.1% margin we had in 2Q 2017, but up 150 basis points from 1Q 2018. About half of the reduction in adjusted EBITDA is directly related to the increased ongoing cost we discussed at the beginning of the year, specifically the ongoing cost due to the security and related technology, our transformation risk office and increased insurance costs. Much of the increases in security and technology related ongoing costs are being incurred directly in business units. The improvement in sequential EBITDA margins is driven by margin growth in USIS as well as International.","USIS revenue in 2Q 2018 was $325 million, down 2% when compared to the very strong second quarter of 2017 and slightly below the 1% year-to-year decline we saw in both 1Q 2018 and 4Q 2017, as well as our expectations. The decline in the overall mortgage market impacted USIS revenue negatively by about 1%. Sequentially, revenue was up 6%, consistent with average sequential growth over the last five years and slightly below the 7% sequential growth in 2Q 2017. The stronger sequential growth in 2Q 2017 was heavily driven by Financial Marketing Services.","Total mortgage-related revenue for USIS was up 8%. Total mortgage related revenue for Equifax, including Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue was up 8%. Our mortgage revenue growth was stronger than the overall market which saw inquiries decline by 5%. USIS Mortgage Solutions business in which we sell tri bureau mortgage reports was benefited by the launch of 3 Bureau trended data in 1Q 2018 and increased share in Mortgage Solutions, the portion of our business that delivers tri bureau reports.","In 3Q 2018, we expect mortgage market volumes to be down high-single digits versus 3Q 2017 and to weaken further in 4Q 2018. For all of 2018, we expect mortgage market volumes to be down high-single digit percent, an improvement from the down 10% we previously expected at the outset of the year.","Online Information Solutions revenue was $224 million, down slightly less than 4% when compared to the year ago period. Core Online was down less, declining slightly less than 3%, with the reminder of the decline principally in identity and fraud solutions driven by reductions in our government customers.","Commercial revenues within OIS were down slightly compared to the year ago period but up slightly when compared to 1Q 2018, reflecting the progress we are making in our transition to the commercial financial network. Sequentially, OIS was up 2%, when compared to 1Q 2018 and core Online was up 3%. This was in line with the average for OIS over the last five years of about 3% and 2Q 2017 sequential growth of 3%. Again, a portion of the slightly weaker sequential growth this year reflects the weakening of the mortgage market between 1Q and 2Q and the increase in share in the Mortgage Solutions business in 2Q.","Financial Marketing Services revenue was $55 million in 2Q 2018, down 9%, compared to a very strong 2Q 2017, which grew 15%. As Mark mentioned earlier, several transactions we had expected to close in 2Q slips to later in the year. We still expect these transactions to close. Sequentially, Financial Marketing Services was up 21% from 1Q 2018, a very good performance, below the 31% we saw in 2Q 2017 but above the average for the last five years, and the second highest sequential growth rate over that five-year period.","As we have discussed previously, the impact on the USIS selling process as customers completed their security reviews was principally on our ability to sell new product into certain customers, to sell batch transactions in Financial Marketing Services and some impact as well to Online. Also, as we have discussed, we have seen our competitors be more aggressive. Overall, this has resulted in lost sales and share.","As Mark discussed earlier, we believe we have made very good progress with customers and now for the substantial majority of customers are able to actively participate in new sales opportunities but we expect will benefit our sales efforts toward the end of 2018, but principally into 2019.","The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 47.7%, down 380 basis points from last year, but up 360 basis points from 1Q 2018. Similar to 1Q 2018, year-to-year USIS margins in 2Q 2018 were principally impacted by the following factors, specifically increased third-party costs, principally in mortgage, negative revenue mix, including a higher mix of lower margin Mortgage Solutions and increased security-related and other technology costs. We continue to expect USIS 2018 revenue to be flat to up slightly from 2017 for the full year.","For the second half of 2018, reflecting the items that impacted the first half of 2018, we expect USIS EBITDA margins to approach the levels delivered in 2Q 2018. 3Q 2018 EBITDA margins will likely be lower than 4Q 2018, as mortgage revenue generally is lowest in the fourth quarter.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $208 million in the quarter, up 7% when compared to 2Q 2017. Verification Services had another very strong quarter with 15% revenue growth, driven by double-digit growth across government, talent solutions, healthcare and auto, and also was better than our expectations. We also grew both active and total records again in 2Q 2018.","Employer Services revenue was $58 million, was down 9%, or about $6 million from last year. As Mark indicated earlier, the decline was principally in unemployment claims and our ACA related business, Workforce Analytics. However, as we look to the second half, we believe Employer Services will see growth as unemployment claims stabilizes and we see growth principally in our employee services businesses, including I-9 and onboarding.","The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.6% in 2Q 2018, down 360 basis points from 2Q 2017. The decline was more than explained by the expected increase in costs related to security and technology and increased investment in sales and marketing, partially offset by positive mix due to the growth in Verifier. Given the positive revenue mix driven by strong growth in Verification Services that we expect to continue throughout 2018, we expect to see continued sequential improvement in Workforce Solutions margins. For the full year, we continue to expect Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margins to be flat to up slightly versus 2017.","International revenue was $250 million in 2Q 2018, up 8% on a reported and local currency basis. Asia Pacific revenue was $86 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and in local currency driven by continued strong growth in our commercial business. Europe's revenues was $72 million in 2Q 2018, up 6% in U.S. dollars and down 1% in local currency. We saw low-double digit local currency growth in our combined UK and Spain credit operations. This was offset by a local currency revenue decline in our debt management business, specifically in our venture with the UK government. As Mark mentioned earlier, we expect to see improved performance in the debt management business overall in the third quarter, and a return to growth in the fourth quarter of this year.","Latin America's revenue was $54 million in 2Q 2018, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 15% in local currency. Revenue growth was broad based, with strong double-digit local currency growth in Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico. Beginning in early May, the country of Argentina saw a substantial increase in inflation and currency devaluation of the Argentinian peso. In the quarter, Equifax Argentina continued to perform well, although we are expecting a more significant impact from foreign exchange in the second half of 2018.","Also beginning in the third quarter, under GAAP accounting, Argentina will be considered a highly inflationary economy and foreign exchange changes related monetary assets will be recognized in the income statement. We will exclude these impacts from our GAAP results beginning in the third quarter, and do not expect them to be material to our consolidated results.","Canada's revenue was $38 million, up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 8% in local currency. Canada's growth was broad based and continues to reflect on their strong execution. International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.5% in 2Q 2018, down 40 basis points from 2Q 2017 but up 110 basis points from 1Q 2018. The year-over-year decline reflects the expected increased spend in security and technology, as well as increased investment and sales generation. We expect EBITDA margins to continue to increase as we move through the second half of 2018.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue was $94 million in 2Q 2018, down 5% on a reported and local currency basis. As Mark covered, our U.S. consumer direct revenue, which now represents just over 30% of GCS revenue, declined more than 25% in the quarter as we have suspended advertising. Our partner-based business which now represents over half of the GCS revenue grew substantially and offset the majority of this decline. As Mark indicated, we intend to restart limited marketing in the U.S. consumer direct business in the fourth quarter.","GCS adjusted EBITDA margin was 31% in 2Q 2018, flat with 2Q 2017. The net decline in revenue and related gross margin was offset by lower marketing expense in our U.S. consumer direct business resulting in flat margins. In 3Q 2018, we expect a further sequential revenue decline, reflecting a further decline in U.S. consumer direct business and a resulting sequential reduction in EBITDA margins. Also, as we move into 4Q 2018 we would expect EBITDA margins to decline relative to 3Q 2018, reflecting both the lower U.S. consumer direct revenue and an increase in marketing expense, as we seek to add new consumers to our U.S. consumer direct business.","In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $73 million. Excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the cybersecurity incident, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $63 million, up $16 million from 2Q 2017. Over half of this reflects the increased ongoing costs we discussed at the beginning of the year, specifically the ongoing cost due to security and related technology, the free Lock & Alert product, our transformation and risk office and increased insurance costs. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 13.7% includes GAAP only tax benefits of $14 million related to adjustments from uncertain tax positions resulting from a settlement with tax authorities for prior tax years and $2 million from the income tax effective stock awards.","For 2Q 2018, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 23.5%. This lower tax rate in 2Q 2018 reflects the following factors. First, we believe our ongoing effective tax rate is approximately 25%, down from the 26.5% we discussed in April. Catching up year-to-date to this lower tax rate in the second quarter, as well as several small discrete tax items resulted in a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 23.5%. For 2018, we now expect our effective tax rate, including discrete items to be about 24.5% with 3Q 2018 somewhat lower than that level. In 2Q 2018, the 150 basis points benefit between the 23.5% effective tax rate achieved and our 25% ongoing rate, was a benefit of about $0.025 per share.","In 2Q 2018, operating cash flow was $235 million and free cash flow was $173 million, up 4% and down 2% compared to the prior year respectively. Through June, operating cash flow was $355 million, and free cash flow was $236 million, up 8% and 3% respectively. Net cash received from insurance recoveries in 2Q 2018 and year-to-date was $45 million.","Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $92 million and year-to-date was $149 million. Capital spending was up sequentially in the second quarter, principally based on the renewal and extension of a large software database licensing agreement. Year-to-date, capital spending is over 8% of revenue. For all of 2018, we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 8% of revenue.","Total net debt at the end of 2Q 2018 was $2.31 billion. Our gross leverage was 2.58 times and net leverage was 2.26 times at the end of 2Q 2018. In 2Q 2018 we issued $1 billion of three and five year fixed and floating rate senior notes. The net proceeds of the sale of notes were used to repay borrowings under the revolver, term loan and commercial paper program. We now have no meaningful debt with a maturity prior to 3Q 2021. We did not repurchase shares in 2Q 2018 and do not expect to in 3Q 2018.","Before returning to guidance, I wanted to cover the impact of the substantial strengthening of the dollar that occurred in May and June. When we provided guidance, we assume FX will remain at the current levels through the entire period. In 2Q 2018, as we indicated earlier, actual FX results versus 2Q 2017 was only a very slight negative impact to revenue. However, relative to our expectations for FX, when we provided 2Q 2018 guidance, the movement in FX in May and June negatively impacted revenue by about 1% and EPS by $0.02 per share. The impact of changes on our guidance for all of 2018 is, of course, much larger. The impact on revenue of FX rates at their current levels relative to our prior expectations is a negative impact to revenue of almost 2% per quarter in 3Q 2018 and 4Q 2018 and on the order of $0.03 per share in each quarter. In total, for all of 2018, the impact on revenue of the stronger dollar is a negative impact of over 1%, and on the order of $0.08 per share.","Now turning to our guidance for 3Q 2018, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $853 and $863 million, reflecting reported growth of 2% to 3% versus 3Q 2017. Foreign exchange, based on current exchange rates, is expected to be negative, almost 2%. Local currency revenue growth is expected to be 4% to 5% verses 3Q 2017. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.39 and $1.44 per share versus 3Q 2017. FX is expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.03 per share.","Using the midpoint of our guidance range, 3Q 2018 is about $0.11 per share weaker than 3Q 2017. In addition, the lower tax rate in 3Q 2018 is a benefit of over $0.10 a share. Offsetting this over $0.20 per share is the following three factors: increased security cost for security, technology transformation and insurance-related to the cybersecurity incident, which we have discussed, of over $0.10 a share; expected negative FX and higher interest costs of over $0.05 a share; and in 3Q 2017 we had a benefit from lower bonus accruals which will not recur of about $0.05 a share.","Sequentially, again using the midpoint of our guidance range, 3Q 2018 is down about $0.14 per share versus 2Q 2018. The factors explaining this lower adjusted EPS are: about half in the business units principally as lower GCS operating profit is partially offset by nice growth in Workforce; USIS is down slightly due to revenue reduction; and the remainder principally from increased security, technology transformation and insurance costs related to the cybersecurity incident. Negative FX and increased interest expense and each year third quarter equity expense increases sequentially versus second quarter as we issue employee equity grants in the third quarter.","Our full year 2018 guidance for Equifax revenue and EPS are unchanged from our previous guidance. In total, we continue to expect Equifax revenue for the year to be between $3.425 and $3.525 billion. This reflects revenue growth of 2% to 5%. FX based on current rates is expected to be over 1% negative to revenue growth in 2018. This assumes total mortgage market volumes declined high-single digit percent in 2018, which is slightly better than our previous guidance. We continue to expect adjusted EPS to be between $5.80 and $6 per share unchanged from our April guidance. FX is expected to be approximately $0.08 per share negative to EPS in 2018. Given the substantial change in FX from our original expectations, we believe it is more likely we will be in the middle to lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance.","For perspective, looking historically at the last five years, excluding 2017, our adjusted EPS in 3Q and 4Q have been sequentially about flat. We expect in 2018 to incur approximately $225 million of net incremental costs for investments in technology and data security projects and legal and professional fees being incurred specifically to address litigation claims in governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. This represents gross cost of approximately $300 million offset by $75 million of insurance proceeds. This represents a $25 million increase in gross costs from our prior estimate.","Investments in technology and data security are expected to represent just over 75% of these costs. These costs are being excluded from our non-GAAP financial results and guidance. In 3Q 2018, we expect these gross costs to exceed the levels incurred in either 1Q 2018 or 2Q 2018. These estimates do not include any estimates of damages, fines or other amounts that may result from the resolution of litigation and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. Our first half results provide a very strong start to 2018, relative to our full year guidance.","Before turning it over to the operator, as this is Jeff Dodge's last earnings call with Equifax, I want to thank him for the tremendous job he has done over the past 10-plus years. He is the standard by which IR professionals are measured in our industry, and he also was a critical player in Equifax strategic and operating decisions over that period. Thanks from me and the entire Equifax team, enjoy a well-earned retirement.","And with that operator, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from George Mihalos of Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning, gentlemen. And it's good to hear about the momentum in USIS and the reiteration of guidance there. John, maybe you can talk a little bit about the cadence in USIS growth 3Q and 4Q, is it going to be relatively steady? I know the comparison is a bit easier in 3Q. And also what the contribution exactly will be from DataX that will be included in the USIS segment?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, George. Thanks for the question. We're not going to be specific obviously in terms of the type of growth cadence by third and fourth quarter, but needless to say, as Mark indicated, we expect to have growth in those periods as well as growth for the year. The contribution from DataX is relatively small. The company is quite small and the contribution really isn't very large.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And just two quick ones if I may, Mark, the decision to kind of stay committed to the GCS direct business, if you could talk a little bit about that and coming back into the market in terms of advertising spend. And then just as it relates to Europe, have we sort of hit the bottom in terms of that minus one local currency growth that we saw in 2Q? Does that now start to turn positive in 3Q and then improve upon that in 4Q?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Sure. I'll start with GCS and maybe John can start on the Europe one. On GCS, we think this is a business that's important to us, dealing with consumers. We have a lot of interactions with consumers when they are dealing with us on the credit bureau side. And we had a nice business prior to the breach that we think we can continue with. We've been consistent in prior calls and meetings that we've had with our investors and others, George, that this isn't a business that we're going to have as the front of our strategy. It's not our primary focus, but it's one that we think is a business that's a good one for Equifax and that we'll start working our way back into doing some advertising and selling value-added products later in the year.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of Europe, right, I mean, basically the discussion is around debt management as you know, and we do expect to see some improvements in the debt management business in the third quarter and we expect to see that business return to growth in the fourth quarter. So that \u2013 those should both be very positive effects for Europe.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just wanted to see if I could get any additional color on how you're thinking about the phasing of the IT and cybersecurity investments in terms of what's going in the buckets this year versus into next year. And also along those lines now that you have the CISO and the CTO in place, has that changed any areas of focus or emphasis on the investments?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yes, good question, Greg. First, I think, John, gave you the guidance as I did, that we're taking up our forecast for this year by $25 million of the spend that we expect to do broadly. The bulk of that $25 million is between security and IT. Beyond this year, we're not ready to give any indications of what it looks like for 2019, but I think we've been clear that we expect to have a sizable investment again next year. And our goal is as we get into the fourth quarter, or later in the \u2013 probably in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, to give some real visibility to you and others around that as far as what our spend will be next year.","With regards to our new CTO from IBM, Bryson, he's only been on the ground for three weeks. We don't expect any significant changes in either our spend level or forecast. How we're going to spend it as a result of him joining, but we do expect him to make some refinements to it. He's got really deep experience around going from legacy to private as well as public cloud and that's part of our strategy. So we think he's going to help us enhance that. He's very product oriented, which will also be a positive for us and there may be some tweaking, if you want to call it, to our plan. I think his bigger impact will be in the plan that we have, he -as that gets shaped in the, call it the, next three, four, five months and we'll be ready to share that with you later in the year.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. In terms of USIS, I think you talked about some of the larger customers and the conversations you are having there. Maybe if we think about it from a vertical perspective, are there any areas that are starting to turn on the spigot faster versus slower and how we should think about that going forward?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","I guess it's hard to think about any verticals that would be any different. When we had the call back in April, we said, look, fourth quarter was really tough. First quarter was very tough with regards to customers wanting to understand our security plans and getting back to giving us some confidence and trust and when we talked in April, we felt some momentum there and some positiveness. That continued into May and June as we're into July. I think I tried to indicate, it's just a small handful, like, less than \u2013 it's less than the five fingers on my hand where we have, what I would characterize some ongoing tensions with customers that still want to see more of our security plans.","The vast majority of the rest are just back to normal mode of operations. And really, it's just our focus now is just getting our NPIs back in front of them, getting that collaboration with their risk teams, their marketing teams around how we can help them grow. And I tried to be quite consistent in that, the message I've gotten everywhere is that Equifax is valued. They value our differentiated data, meaning we've got data assets that we can bring that others can't, which is a real value for us.","From my perspective, we're kind of getting back to that more normal mode of operations. And I'm quite energized around Paulino coming back in. You know and others on the call know, he's an experienced leader, he's an aggressive leader, he's a commercial leader, and he and I and the team are going to be laser focused. We have been for the last couple of months and we will be for the rest of the year on really getting ourselves back to that normal growth mode in USIS. And we expect to see progress as we go week by week and month by month through rest of this year, into next year.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks and congrats to Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. First, I guess, just coming back to the discussions with customers. I know you said vast majority of them gotten better. Is it still the case, I guess, as you move further where you're not seeing a disruption to the kind of the Online business, it's more the back processing? Or is that still a fair description? And then secondly, you talked about competitors being aggressive, I guess. Have you seen that intensify or change at all? Or is it basically is an environment similar to what you would have described three to six months ago.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. They kind of tie together, Tim, it's a good question. Look, it's a competitive space, every space is. We operate versus 2Principle (51:37) and dozens of other competitors. And it was competitive before the security incident last fall and it's competitive since then. And so I think you point out that it is and will continue to be. Our competitors, I'm sure, it wasn't lost on them what happened to us last September and they would certainly probably try to take advantage of that in the past nine months.","That said we're going to be aggressive, too. We're going to be aggressive about maintaining our business. We're going to be aggressive about getting new business. And your question about Online versus batch, for the most part, I would characterize any changes in Online of being really related more to that normal competitive environment that we all live in versus something related to September. There's no question that the September incident impacted our batch and some of our NPI stuff. We've been clear about that. And you know our competitors have put up some really impressive numbers in the U.S. and a lot of that has been them taking share from us, we believe, in some of the batch and new product stuff. We're laser focused in getting back our share of that, as we go into July and the third quarter and the second half of the year and we expect to do so.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","And as we talked about before, right, with NPI, a lot of NPI it drives Online. So, when you're asking does it impact Online revenue, certainly it does, absolutely. So, there's been impacts across the board, as we said. Online, batch, have both been impacted by the fact that we were impeded in our ability to sell, absolutely.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","And Tim, just want to \u2013 one other point about \u2013 this, obviously, is an active world. And we're out there competing. But last night I got a verbal from our commercial team, from one of our U.S. customers that moved some business to us in a positive way that was with one of our competitors. So those things happen all the time. But, the good news is, is its happening, meaning we're out there winning in the marketplace. And I expect to see that to continue, particularly under Paulino's leadership and with the kind of focus and effort I'm going to put on it \u2013 continue to put on it as we go through the rest of the year.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then just secondly, the increase to the spending on technology, I guess, is it just proving to be more expensive than you would have said before? Are you increasing the, I guess, the magnitude, I guess, of what you're trying to achieve or are you trying to get it done sooner? I guess how should we think about that spending?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. I would think about it as pace, right? So, when we gave you the initial guidance back in March, we were in the process of trying to ramp the resources necessary for us to deliver the changes that we committed to. And quite honestly at that time, that the \u2013 the exact pace at which we could ramp that level of resources wasn't completely clear. So, what we found is, I think, we've been able to ramp a little more effectively, so that our pace of completion is faster. And I think when we gave the guidance initially, back in March, we said to the extent we could go quicker, we would. And I think that's what you're seeing, since we can go quicker, we are.","Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks, Tim.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Appreciate taking the question. Mark, with regard to the aggressiveness of the competition, which I guess should be expected and your commentary about growing and, you know, improving consumer customer, I should say receptivity, are you as confident now recognizing 100 days in as you might otherwise have been about having the right technology and the right solutions in USIS, is there \u2013 you know given the current offerings, the potential to meaningfully reaccelerate the growth in your view, is it just a matter of continuing to improve the selling motion and customer relations and ramping NPI? Or do you think there's new technology or new solutions that you might need to fill gaps at this point?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, it's a great question, Andrew. I think last time we spoke I was maybe 10 days into my role and now being three plus months I covered a lot more ground. And I was \u2013 I know a lot more now and I'm even more energized frankly about our market position. I believe, and I hear this from our customers, that's where I get the data point from is that our customers' view our data assets to be differentiated. So that's a very good thing.","Second is, they view our products, our technology, our NPI cadence, our DNA resources as being a real asset also. So I view that as a real advantage and I'm excited about that. I think we've also been clear that we've got some technology opportunities to allow us to speed up our ability to get products to market. Our competitors, my sense is over the last five years, made some investments there that we did not, we're doing that now. And that's part of the investments we're making this year and that will roll into next year that will allow us to be even more differentiated, I believe, as we go forward.","And the last one is that, there's great commercial relationships with Equifax. Those customers \u2013 the customer I was with yesterday has been with us for 40 years. And they are one of our key customers and we're primary there. And there's just a very strong relationship with or without the data security breach. They were supportive as we went through it. They paused, if you want it, in the first six months about new things, but now we are back to the races.","So, I'm really energized about the future and I don't need to remind you, if you go back literally a year ago and look at USIS, with our data assets, with how we went to market, with our commercial infrastructure, the business was performing very well. And 12 months later, with the data security breach, obviously, putting some pressure on the business and the team, I look at that and it gives me great confidence along with the dozens and dozens of commercial discussions I've had, that we're going to get back. We'll get back to that growth mode that you're used to and that we want to deliver for you and our other shareholders. And I add on top of that the team.","I'm really energized about Paulino agreeing to step back into a role that he did really well. Many of you saw him operate, you saw him lead and he's been there a week. I had dinner with he and his leadership team last night and they are charged up. And that is a long list of things that gives me confidence and it gives me more energy and confidence, frankly than I had when I was two weeks in. So, a long answer to your question, which is a very good one.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And if I may just follow-up with a quick one. Just for my own edification, when I think about Ignite, Cambrian, just as a framework, could you put a little meat on that bone for me, just in terms of an example of maybe a vertical or a specific function where that technology changes the sort of the, I guess, the value proposition or specific example of Ignite, Cambrian's value proposition, I guess. So we can think about it a little more clearly.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","John might be able to give a better specific example. But I will just give you kind of in a generality. By getting Ignite into our customers and allowing their data and analytics, their risk team to have quicker and easier access to our data is incredibly valuable. And remember, Andrew, I was a customer. I ran Synchrony for nine years, so I know how data is used. I know how data and analytics teams work from a customer perspective. And this tool is so valuable to them to have really broad access to our data to experiment, to model and by having Ignite embedded with our customer, it just makes us more sticky with them. It makes their access to us more valuable. It allows them to test and model things in just a faster fashion, allows us to co-collaborate with them. So it's an incredibly valuable tool that as you know, we're actively deploying in the marketplace with our customers that we think is just going to be another step change in that integration and close commercial collaboration with our customers. Would you add, John, to that?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Only thing I'd add, we're very complete with Ignite Direct, obviously, also our customers their data scientists can contribute their own data...","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Correct.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","...can use third-party market data and can use our NeuroDecisioning (sic) [NeuroDecision] (01:00:24)Technology to generate products and understand where that relationships exist that we can deliver faster. And as Mark said, the technology investments we're making will allow us to get those products to market faster with those customers. And I know you know this Jeffrey, Ignite Marketplace is more of an app, right? So it allows our business users within our customers to take a look and run analytics against their broader business more simply, like you would with an app, as opposed to requiring a data scientist to do the work. So we think we have a great solution in Cambrian, Ignite Direct and Marketplace and we think we can be very well.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We will now take our next question from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. Good morning. So, you know, with the strategic decision to continue on the U.S. direct to consumer business, it sounds like you'll restart marketing in the fourth quarter. Heard that you expect that marketing spend to return to pre-breach levels, just to help level set expectations for your investors, would that be in the kind of single-digit million of spending per quarter?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yes, we typically \u2013 as you know, David, we don't give the number out on that, but I would say we're still finalizing those plans. We've been consistent that \u2013 I've been consistent that we view this as a business that we want to be in. It's a business that we're never going to be as big as some of our competitors, use that as a boundary on it. And our entry is going to be what I would characterize as measured and whether we're actually at those levels or not, I think it's difficult to forecast at this stage, but we're going to walk our way into this in the fourth quarter and then we'll look at their performance and then make decisions about what we do in 2019 and everything we talked about is inside of kind of the guidance we've given you.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. And just in the fourth quarter, since we're just starting to do it as Mark said, you shouldn't expect to see anything really large, right.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","It's something we've ramped into slowly. Again, all we're trying to do is give people a perspective that we're not looking at a large re-entry here. We weren't really large in that business in 2016 and 2017 either. This is a relatively small business that doesn't have large investment.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I'll take another approach to the question about ongoing IT and security costs. Will you be fully ramped up in terms of staffing and head count and spending on those plans in the second half of 2018? And I understand you don't know if those costs will be up or down in 2019, but potentially, could you start to see some cost savings from simplifications but benefits from these, the work that you're doing in 2018 as you move into 2019?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, I think on the first half of your question about kind of getting fully staffed, it's \u2013 staffing is difficult to forecast but it's our goal to kind of be at a full staffing level. I know Bryson is looking at bringing in some new talent just like Jamil, our CISO did. And that will happen. It's happening as we speak. He's already worked a couple of hires. So my view to that first question is that we should be at kind of a run rate of the team as we finish out the year.","With regards to 2019, I think we've been clear that we're going to work those plans between now and the fourth quarter and share those with you once they are complete. And with regards to cost base, too early to predict that. But to be clear, our goal in making these significant IT investments are to allow us to accelerate our revenue growth, to increase our speed of products to market. And as you point out, just simplify our structure both from redundant systems and using cloud, either private or public as appropriate to improve our cost structure and, yes, we expect through these investments to have efficiencies that will deliver along with the revenue growth and as we define those, which our goal is to do that as we get into the latter parts of the year, Bryson has some time to get on the ground, we'll share them with you.","David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.","Allison Chou - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. This is Allison Chou on for George. Could you speak to trends you're seeing in Workforce Solutions and particularly Employer Services post breach and where you expect the margin improvement in the back half of the year to come from?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yes. So just, again, I think we talked a bit about this in the script, right. I mean, what you're seeing in terms of the weakness in the first half of the year is principally around unemployment, insurance claims, our tax services business as well as in our ACA business. A lot of that's being driven obviously on the UC side by unemployment and in ACA I think it's kind of well chronicled what's going on there. So, I think what we're expecting to see as we go through the rest of this year is that we believe that those businesses are somewhat stabilizing and we're starting to see a little bit of growth in some of our employee services business. By employee services, it's the services we provide to our customers to help them board employees and manage their employees, and there I think we're expecting to see some improvement. In our I-9 business we're expecting to see some improvement, in our onboarding business and that should allow us to deliver a little bit of growth as we go through the back half. So we believe the declines should be behind us and we're starting to see \u2013 we expect to see some growth as we go through the rest of this year.","Margins in that business, in the total Workforce Solution business, we don't give margins by sub-segment. Again, you saw margins down a little bit in the first half. I think we said specifically related to the substantial security investments that we made, as well as the decision to add more marketing and sales, because that business is doing very, very well. So I think what you're seeing is Verifier growth continues and escalates as you go through the year. And as you've seen so far, and as we see employers somewhat flatten out, therefore the growth of that business grows. It's a very high variable margin business and we're expecting that you'll see gross margins increase from the levels we're at right now.","Allison Chou - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And in terms of NPI and product generation and collaboration with customers, can you give more color on the areas of focus there, any competitive changes you've seen and maybe which businesses you expect to most benefit from NPI going forward, whether you expect that mid-50s level to ramp meaningfully in 2019 and 2020?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yes, the NPI focus that, Allison, we've talked about on the call today and we tend to talk about with you is really around our core credit bureau or USIS and its both in the U.S. and of course our products travel globally. I don't see any different trends or competitive impacts there. This has been a really strong muscle for Equifax for a lot of years, and I think we've talked in prior calls that we've worked hard to make sure we protect the resources around our NPI processes as we're ramping up our IT and data security investments, and it feels like we've done a good job at that, meaning that the NPI engine is still working at Equifax.","And with regards to getting north of the kind of pace we've had, I don't think we see that and I'm actually quite pleased that we're still on pace with kind of a consistent and attractive NPI engine working at Equifax. It's a big priority for us. We have a lot of people focused on it. It's one of our \u2013 it has been one of our growth levers and it will be going forward. So it's clearly a priority.","Allison Chou - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right, great.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","If you look at \u2013 International has been very strong at NPI too. So historically, and they continue to work at it. International's performed very well on NPI.","Allison Chou - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great, thanks, guys.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Brett Huff of Stephens.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking the question, guys.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Hey, Brett.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","And Jeff, congratulations to you. It's been good working with you. Two questions from me. On the EBITDA declines that you mention, I think, John, I think you mentioned this, you said about half of the overall decline year-over-year for the company in margin was due to the ongoing security investments and things like that. I'm just trying to make sure I'm parsing out kind of what the one-timers are, if you will, that you're excluding versus what the ongoing base cost will be. Is that \u2013 if we just do that math and take half of that margin and multiply it times the revenue, does that give us a reasonably good ballpark on what the current ongoing investment will be? And I know 2019 may be more or less. I'm not asking that question. But is that the right way to think about magnitude from an ongoing addition to the base that we should expect to continue?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Well, maybe getting at it another way, right? When we did guidance initially back in March, for the full year, we indicated that you'd see about $0.40 a share from investments in security, technology, free product Lock & Alert and insurance, right? And we're kind of on pace for that type of number, not exactly. But there'll be \u2013 but it's \u2013 we're pretty much on pace for that type of number. So I think that's the way you should think about what those types of ongoing costs look like as we're looking at this year.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, it's helpful. And the second question, you all talked a little bit about getting closer to your customers and you also mentioned the growth in some of your competitors has been better for a variety of reasons. Wondering, in terms of moving to reaccelerate, or working on reaccelerating particularly the USIS business, how do you think about getting closer to your customers versus the money you want to put into NPI or the processes around those two things? It sounds like there's a new focus on getting closer to the customer. How does that rank in terms of growth acceleration relative to NPI?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Well, they are both important. The NPI, Brett, from my perspective, has been a strong muscle of Equifax for a long time. So, that's in place and I think it's well organized. We've got very rigorous processes in place. We collaborate with customers. So that one's working and the thing we try to manage, what we're trying to manage this year is make sure we keep the resources dedicated to that, so it doesn't slow down when we're doing our security and IT transformation. So, that's happening.","The closer to the customer one is really one that's \u2013 an initiative that I'm really driving. And it's obviously quite logical. If you're closer to your customers, you're going to be able to engage more in commercial discussions, you're going to be able to show them new products. You're going to be able to show them new data analytics to help them grow. And it's really probably twofold. One, it's my DNA. That's how I lead as a business leader. I want our team to be close to customers. I think Equifax has always been that way. And it's quite natural, following the data security breach last September, the organization turned somewhat inward, which is natural. There was a lot of work done inside of the business and that focus externally, when I landed, call it three months ago wasn't where I would want it to be. And that's what I've just been ramping up. And I'm leading from my chair, by spending, call it half of my time in the field with customers. I'm in there with our key client teams and with our data and analytics teams. And it's really a mode of operations that I want to be a part of. And with regards to priority, I would say the NPI and being close to customers kind of go together. I'm just putting more emphasis on it.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's \u2013 and then just one smaller question on the analytics, the Cambrian, Ignite group, kind of most of your customers have something that is similar, a kind of flexible data and analytics product. How do you all see the differentiation between what you offer and maybe what they offer? Is it in the analytics or is it in the base data? Or is there a simple way to think about that from us looking outside in?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, I think outside in I think it's what we've talked about really consistently. The differentiation that we believe we bring is the data assets, as Mark mentioned, right? So we think we have differentiated data assets beyond credit in terms of The Work Number, in terms of NCTUE, in terms of now obviously DataX, right? So we think that the data assets we bring to bear is what helps differentiate what we offer. We think we have an outstanding technology platform, and we think it's incredibly flexible. It's very modern. So we're extremely happy with it.","And also the other thing that's critical to remember is NeuroDecisioning (sic) [NeuroDecision] (01:13:22), right? It's a patent pending activity where we can do machine learning and through that machine learning we can actually determine reason codes. And so use the machine learning algorithm to determine algorithms that we can sell to customers and that they can use in production because we can determine reason codes. So, all of those things, with think, are what give us a product that's extremely strong. I'm sure our competitors have reasons they like theirs. Those are the reasons we like ours.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's really helpful. Appreciate the time, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, Mark. Are you able to give us any more color on your confidence on USIS returning to organic revenue growth in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter? I know you said more normal commercial activity, obviously. I see the easier comp. Is there any more specific you could give me around that dynamic of returning to growth and staying in the growth mode for USIS?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. I'll start will \u2013 I've been \u2013 said maybe four or five different ways in this call that the focus from our team is like crystal clear and laser. It's our biggest priority. It's one that the team is on, the addition of Paulino, we think is going to be quite attractive. I'm spending a lot of time there. So, the resources and focus are there.","And then it's \u2013 I'm really giving kind of my perspectives and the team perspectives. As I said, I had dinner with the team last night. We had a detailed discussion with them last week and where we're going through pipelines. And when we see pipelines building of commercial activity, that gives me confidence. When you \u2013 when I'm out with customers and we hear them, and then just have a dialog, yesterday, last Friday, the earlier last week when I'm meeting with customers, they are ready to get back into a growth mode.","You think about it for your customer and they're an Equifax partner, meaning we've been doing business with them, they've got growth needs. They want to access our unique data. They want to access DataX. They want to use The Work Number. They want to use Ignite, because they want to grow. They've got their own growth challenges and we're one of the levers of growth for them. So, I've got a lot of confidence in the team. It feels like there's some wind building behind our sails, which I think is a positive. And we're focused on getting back to that growth mode. It's still going to take time. It's not going to be something that's going to happen tomorrow or next week, but the \u2013 with the pipeline building, converting those to deals and revenue, that's the kind of mode that we're going to be in as we go into \u2013 as we're in the third quarter already and as we go through the rest of the year.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks. And a big thank you and congrats to Jeff from me as well. I guess first question on the Verifier growth, the mortgage market is down, the auto market is not overly growthy and you're calling it a really good rate and accelerating. I hear you on the records growth but anything else going on with Verifier, any sort of like new go-to-market product refinement, just any other leg to growth that's driving really good growth relative to the end market?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Look, overall, they are continuing to execute on the strategies they have for an extended period of time. As the records continue to extend, then obviously that drives growth themselves. But it also makes the specific application more attractive in each of the end markets you just referenced, right? So, we talked about the markets that we're growing and they've done a nice job of selling into markets where the expanded record base now makes us even more attractive. They've started \u2013 they focused on NPI. They're offering new products that allow us to get more information to individual verticals. If, for example, they don't need the entire Work Number record, but they can use a subset of the record to drive revenue at a lower price we've structured products to allow that to be the case, and to also provide them historical information that may not be as valuable as current \u2013 as the current information, but it's valuable in their decisioning process. So, they've just broadened what we can sell and have been more effective in selling. So they've done a nice job.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Jeff, (01:17:54). We probably don't give workforce enough justice in dialoguing with you, at least since I've been here. This is a really good business. And from my perspective, we're still in the early innings of the kind of creativity we can bring about how The Work Number can be used, new verticals, new spaces, more penetration in auto, more use cases around government for verification. There are a lot of opportunities, and as John pointed out, and then how we deliver it. This is a very exciting business that we view as a growth engine for us, as we go through the rest of this year and into the future. And as I say, I view it as early innings, because there's just a lot of potential here.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, second, can you give us any kind of sensitivity to the potential outcomes from the ongoing conversations with the customers where you're still in the \u2013 working through the risk zone or getting them comfortable with your data security, et cetera? Like if one of those customers would go from primary to secondary or tertiary, is that a 1% consolidated revenue headwind? Is it more? Is it less? Just any sizing of that risk factor, thank you.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, it's hard to size. First off, it's very few. I think I'd characterized it as, like, less than five fingers on my hand. We got a couple that we're really working on. And what the dialog is, is they just want to see more progress on our security efforts. We're dialoguing with them on a biweekly, weekly basis. We're showing them our work plans. We make progress every day with them and I'm trying to be open and transparent with you, that sure, there are couple.","I don't anticipate what you described happening, meaning us changing our position but growing with them is not happening right now. The NPI discussions aren't happening with a couple of customers and that's something we want to move them to the more normal mode of discussions and we're going to work on that. The vast, vast, vast majority of our customers, that's behind us. They understand our data security plans. They believe in them. They see the kind of spending we're making, the kind of people we're bringing in. So, their confidence in us executing that is quite strong. And the dialogs are normal and we're into testing products, testing data sets, putting agreements in place to roll out new products, that's where the vast majority of our customer discussions are.","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","And you know this \u2013 our customer base is extremely diverse and we generally don't have really large customers but we have no customers that are near 3% of revenue, and any with that would be even moving up in that geography. The number is very small, right.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. Good point.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Bill. Hey, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So first, shout out to Jeff Dodge and congratulations on setting a new record for the longest drum roll pre-retirement.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Well done!","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So it sounds like the revenue momentum is improving and in the USIS, and we can see that in the sequential trends, and when do you think we'll start to see margins return to historical levels?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Do you want to take that margin question, John? Bill's question is when will margins return to historical levels?","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. So, we haven't really done a long-term model, Bill, right. So I mean if basically that's the question and so I think we'll be vindicated is \u2013 as we move forward here, we'll make a determination as to when we're ready to talk about the long-term model again, but we're just not there. So...","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","And, I think, Bill, we've also been clear in the last call and in other conversations, our goal is to do that. We're trying to do that before the end of the year. We want to have some more clarity around our legal discussions and some more clarity around the USIS trajectory and then some more clarity around our investment in technology spend and data security and IT.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then my second and final question, the DataX acquisition, I know that's a smaller deal. The \u2013 but it is the first acquisition that you guys have done since the breach last September. So is that a one-off or are you guys back in the M&A market?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah, we've actually done a couple as I mentioned in my comments, Bill. We did one in Latin America and one in Workforce and then DataX, I don't know if this is number three or four. Is that...","John W. Gamble, Jr. - Equifax, Inc.","I think we've done four or five. Yeah.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Okay, so we've done four or five. And these have been bolt-ons and tuck-ins. And the other thing in my comments, Bill, I tried to be clear about is the M&A machine was never turned off. But If you want to characterize that way, we got it turned on meaning that our team is out there. We have monthly meetings on it. I meet with the team all the time, the team that works for me, that works on M&A, and we're in the marketplace. And we're going to be looking for more of these DataX type acquisitions where we can do something that's going to bolt-on to our business.","I've been clear in prior discussions that I'm a bolt-on guy. Looking for acquisitions where we can either have capabilities or product or importantly data assets is a real priority for us. And at the same time, I don't foresee another Veda in our near future, but we look for those. That was an example of a platform that gave us a really great position in Australia and is going to turn out, I believe, to be a very attractive acquisition for us. You know, those are things that we're looking at, too. So the M&A machine is on.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Well, thank you very much.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thank you for squeezing me in here. I know you haven't come out with a longer term model yet, but I just want to ask you, after your first 100 days, is there anything that you are seeing within Equifax or you're anticipating from the data breach that longer term changes the way that this company operated within the industry? I mean historically, Equifax had a leadership position in terms of being a leader in terms of growth through the cycle, ability to generate certain amount of growth. Is there anything that you're seeing after taking more of a deep dive that says that over time you can't get back to more of a leadership position over here or is there \u2013 either with in terms of the assets you have, in terms of the position with the clients that you've got, or anything else that you're looking at?","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","Yeah. It's a great question. I think if you step back and look at Equifax, look at our Workforce Solutions and International franchises they performed well prior to the breach. They're performing extremely well post the breach. Those are strong and intact. And I look at those as really attractive businesses for Equifax going forward. And I mentioned earlier that I would characterize Workforce as being early innings, meaning there is just a lot of opportunities for Workforce here in the United States. And we're looking at bringing Workforce to a couple of other markets like Canada, the UK and perhaps Australia.","So, you take those and \u2013 on USIS, there's no change in our differentiated assets. We've talked about that multiple times today. There's no change in our ability to bring new products to marketplace and obviously we took a real dent in customer confidence and trust as a result of security breach, but literally 12 months ago on this call, the second quarter last year, USIS was performing quite well and it's my expectation that we go back to that.","Now, I'm going to be careful because I don't want to get into the long-term model, but when you think about the investments we're making in our data security, that's kind of table stakes. We're going to be an industry leading there, but the investments in our information technology have to deliver positive differentiation to us. When we get products to market quicker, when we're a more reliable data partner to our customers, that has to be positive to us in the future. And it has been pointed out in a prior question, our investments in our data infrastructure are going to deliver efficiencies when we have five versions of something we are running today, and we go to one, and you move either a private or public cloud, that's going to be a positive moving forward.","So, we're going to spend more money on security. I think John has pointed that out. But when I think about the future for us, this is a business that performed extremely well for many, many years. I expect it to do the same in the future, to be a very strong competitor in our space, to be a great partner to our customers, and I'm very energized about the future for Equifax when you combine the underlying business and add to that the technology investment we're making, you get out into 2019, 2020, this is a very attractive business in our space.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, great. Thank you very much to that. And I also want to give a shout out to Jeff Dodge. It's been a pleasure working with him over the last 10 years.","Mark W. Begor - Equifax, Inc.","I'm keeping track, Jeff, but they're racking up the shout outs.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Trevor Burns for any additional or closing remarks.","Trevor Burns - Equifax, Inc.","No. Thanks, everybody, for their time today, and I'll be consistent and give Jeff another shout out. Anybody has any follow-up questions we'll be available after the call. Thank you very much.","Mark W.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Trevor Burns","Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, including first quarter and full-year 2019 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes costs associated with the realignment of internal resources and other activities, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets.","Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incidents, principally fees relating to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental project cost designed to enhance technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as our projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networking systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019 and in 2020.","Adjusted EBITDA has defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and also as the case for adjusted EPS, excluding cost related to 2017 cybersecurity incident, cost associated with the realignment of internal resources and other activities and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso denominated net monetary assets.","These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In addition to the non-GAAP measures that we posted on our website we are now posting certain supplemental financial information on our Investor Relations deck on our website to better help you understand our business.","In the Form 10-K to be filed later today, we will disclose that future losses from litigation and regulatory investigations associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident are reasonably possible, but not yet estimable at this stage in the proceedings.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark.","Mark Begor","Thanks, Trevor. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start to discuss this morning with a few minutes on our fourth quarter results and then move to a discussion on our strategy, technology transformation, and 2019 guidance. So first on the fourth quarter.","Revenue came in at $835 million, which was up 2% in constant currency. This was at the \u2013 inside the range that we had given you a few months ago, but at the low end of that guidance. During the quarter, we experienced a weaker-than-expected U.S. mortgage market as inquiries were down approximately 15% or about 500 basis points weaker than we expected. Versus the fourth quarter 2017, a weaker mortgage market impacted overall revenue growth by about 2% and versus our guidance by just under $500 million \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $5 million. The mortgage market declines have been challenging to forecast well. Excluding this mortgage market impact, overall revenue growth was about 4%, which we were pleased with.","Importantly, USIS revenue grew almost 2% excluding the impact of the declining U.S. mortgage market. EWS reported growth of the strong 12% and international local currency revenue growth of 5% was impacted by a soft Australia and Argentinean market, and in line with the third quarter. USIS growth of 2% excluding the mortgage market impact was another sequential quarterly growth for that business as it continues to return to a growth mode.","Adjusted EPS of a $1.38 per share, includes $0.04 per share due to a lower tax rate than in our October guidance. Adjusting for the incremental tax benefit, adjusted EPS of a $1.34 per share was about $0.02 above the midpoint of the guidance we provided last October.","Total non-recurring and one-time costs in the fourth quarter were $181 million. This includes $114 million of technology and security, $12 million of legal and regulatory, $9 million for consumer support, and $46 million for the cost reduction action we executed late in the quarter. In our Investor Relations presentation on our website, we\u2019ve included a chart that detailed the breakdown of these costs for each quarter of 2018, as well as our guidance for 2019. So now a few more comments on the business units in the fourth quarter.","As I mentioned, USIS revenue was down 2% on a reported basis compared to last year, but importantly, USIS was up 2% excluding the 400 basis point impact of the mortgage market. For us, this is a positive sign of continued improvement and a return to a growth mode for this critical business inside of Equifax.","Online was up slightly overall and was up 4% excluding the mortgage market. This is the second quarter in a row we\u2019ve seen Online growth excluding the mortgage market impact. Mortgage Solutions was down double-digits as expected given the decline in the mortgage market, and to a lesser extent channel shift with mortgage resellers, partially offset by new products we introduced early in 2018.","CMS or Credit Marketing Services was up about 2%, which is the first time we\u2019ve seen growth in this segment since the first quarter of 2018. Overall Financial Marketing Services was down about 1% as IXI saw volume declines. In our Commercial and Telecom and Utilities segments, both grew double-digits in the quarter. As you can see, absent the substantial impact of a declining mortgage market, we\u2019re starting to see growth in recovery in USIS, which we expect to continue in 2019.","In terms of our U.S. customers, we\u2019re back to selling across the portfolio of our customer base. As we discussed on prior calls, the substantial progress with customers started in mid-2018 and so given our six to 18 months sales cycle, we should start to see those benefits of being in a commercial mode with our customers during the early part in first half of 2019, with accelerating improvements in the second half of 2019. We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets coupled with our technology investments will return USIS to its traditional growth mode, but we remain cautious about the pace of the recovery, given the complexities of dealing with new customers and dealing with existing customers on new products. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 47.5% were down from fourth quarter 2017 or at the highest levels in 2018.","I\u2019m sure you saw our announcement, a week ago, that Sid Singh joined us as President of USIS. Sid joins us from Global Payments where he served as Group President of Integrated Solutions and Vertical Markets. Sid brings a deep understanding of unique data and how to accelerate product development through leveraging data analytics and advanced technology platforms. He is a high energy growth leader with real depth in technology and an intense focus on customers. Sid joined Global Payments in 2006 and was instrumental in developing the technology and software-led business strategy to help transform Global Payments into a highly differentiated payments leader. Prior to his work at Global Payments, Sid held senior management positions with HSBC and Citibank. We are thrilled to have Sid joining our leadership team.","As you saw in the announcement, a week ago also, Paulino has agreed to work closely with Sid on his transition and help me with our strategy, M&A and partnership efforts. Both Paulino and I will work closely with Sid to drive USIS back to growth and to assist in his transition into Equifax. USIS continues to be a personal priority of me and the entire company.","Shifting now to Workforce Solutions, that business had a very strong quarter with revenue up 12%. Verification Services was very strong in the quarter with revenue up 15%, driven by strong double-digit growth across healthcare, government talent solutions, debt management, card and auto.","EWS like USIS was also impacted by the decline in the overall mortgage market, which negatively impacted their revenue growth by about 400 basis points. Ex-mortgage, EWS would have been up a very strong 16%. Employer Services also grew in the quarter up 6%, principally driven by growth in I-9 and onboarding services. The strong verifier growth resulted in a very strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 48.7% or an expansion in the quarter of 320 basis points.","As I have indicated before, Rudy and his entire team are laser-focused on the Work Number record growth. The team continues to execute on a strategy to identify and acquire new data contributors to expand its data assets. The team added more records in the fourth quarter than any prior quarter over the past five years. Total Work Number records are now approaching 90 million, and I think as you know from your experience with the company, when we add a new record its quickly monetized. We expect this Work Number growth to continue in 2019. EWS is clearly an extremely attractive franchise business for Equifax with big growth potential in the future.","International revenue was down on a reported basis 3%, but up 5% in local currency, which was about consistent with third quarter 2018 but weaker than the 8% delivered in the first half of 2018. This slower growth in the second half of 2018 continues to be driven by the weak consumer and commercial lending markets in Australia that really started to soften in September and the ongoing weak economic conditions in Argentina.","Our Latin America business grew high single digits in local currency in the fourth quarter, despite the continued headwinds in Argentina that began early in 2018. Revenue growth was driven by double-digit constant currency growth in Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Mexico, and high single-digit growth in Argentina and Uruguay. Our Latin America franchises are benefiting from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS in 2018, which we rolled out and strong NPI rollouts in both 2017 and 2018.","Our European business grew between mid and high single digits in local currency in the fourth quarter. We continue to see high single-digit local currency growth in our European credit operations. And as we expected, our European debt management business started to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Shifting to Canada. Our business in Canada grew mid-single digits in local currency in the fourth quarter, slightly below our expectation reflecting the timing of some project-based revenues between quarters. Canada\u2019s full year local currency revenue growth of 8% with broad based, reflecting our focus on customer innovation and new products.","Our Asia-Pacific business grew low single-digits in local currency in the fourth quarter, down from the 10% plus growth seen in the first half of 2018, and consistent with the weakening we began to see in September around consumer lending, particularly mortgage and other consumer credit markets in Australia. While we expect to see continued weakness in Australia credit markets as we move into 2019, we\u2019re focused on innovative new customer solutions specifically in our Australian commercial business.","Adjusted International EBITDA margins at 32.4% were up nicely in the fourth quarter, reflecting improvements in Europe and Asia-Pacific. I continue to be excited about our international business in the collaborative and innovation growth focus we are seeing from John and our Global team.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue declined 12% on a reported and local currency basis in the fourth quarter and was in line with our expectations. As we\u2019ve discussed throughout 2018, our GCS U.S. Consumer Direct business saw substantial revenue declines as a result of our suspension of U.S. consumer advertising in the fall of 2017 after the cybersecurity incident.","U.S. Consumer Direct business revenue declined almost 25% in the fourth quarter to $27 million and was down over $40 million to $118 million for the full year. Dann and his team began limited direct marketing to U.S. consumers in October and that continued through the fourth quarter and into 2019. While our marketing investment in the fourth quarter was lower than historical levels, we saw subscriber growth at cost that were consistent with our expectations, a very positive sign as we enter 2019.","Our GCS partner business which include ID Watchdog delivered high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter and double-digit growth for the year. We expect ID Watchdog to continue to grow double-digits and continue to see growth \u2013 nice growth opportunities in our partner business, both in U.S. and internationally.","Adjusted EBITDA margins in GCS declined to 21.1% in the fourth quarter as expected, as we saw the impact of the revenue loss and the impact are beginning to ramp our advertising as we went into the marketplace. We expect margins in GCS to increase in 2019 as we see the benefit of fourth quarter and early 2019 advertising, and leverage our growing partner revenue.","So before I get into discussion of 2019, I\u2019d like to take a minute to look back on 2018, which was clearly a challenging year for Equifax by any measure. The 2017 cybersecurity incident had a massive impact on our business on many fronts, and we entered 2018 with a great deal of uncertainty, from changes including team leadership positions, including the CEO role, U.S. customer concerns that we worked on throughout the year. Our competitors clearly took aggressive actions when we were on our heels. You know we were addressing a wide range of legal and regulatory matters, and we\u2019re executing on a multi-year security and technology transformation.","So looking back, although our path to returning to our traditional growth mode is taking longer than we expected, we\u2019ve made very strong steps forward in 2018 and our path back to growth in market leadership. I\u2019m very proud of several key accomplishments.","First, data security was a primary focus for our team and we made great progress, including instilling a security first culture across all of Equifax. We have a much stronger data security infrastructure and are committed to continuing to invest to be the industry leader in data security. We launched our multiyear technology investment transformation program that will take our technology to market leading capabilities and deliver a cost savings and speeder market \u2013 speeder products to market. This is a transformational investment and I\u2019ll cover this in more detail in a few minutes.","We also made great strides in protecting and empowering consumers launching new free services like Lock and Alert to lock and freeze consumers\u2019 credit files. In our USIS business, we made massive steps towards regaining the trust of our customers and partners and are now positioned to operate in a normal commercial mode.","And lastly, we refined our go-forward strategy and execution plans for the next two years that internally and externally we\u2019re calling EFX 2020. I\u2019ll cover this in a more detail shortly. We could not have accomplished these goals without the hard work and dedication of our 11,000 employees around the globe. We clearly have work to do in 2019, but 2018 set us up with a solid foundation for returning Equifax to growth and market leadership.","So let me turn to 2019 as well as a few comments looking forward to 2020. Since joining in Equifax last April, I\u2019ve learned a great deal about the company and the state of the business. When I joined I was clear that I believe this strategy and direction of the company was sound, and I continue to believe that is true. However, there are some critical areas in which we must sharpen our focus to return to and exceed the levels of performance we delivered in the past.","In late 2018, we launched what we are calling EFX 2020 as a framework for our investments and priorities for the future. These strategic initiatives that will make up our EFX 2020 strategy represented blending of the successful strategy in place when I arrived in these new focus areas.","First, Equifax is a data analytics technology company. To be a technology company, we need to deliver market-leading technology embed that technologies as part of our products. We are convinced that our massive technology transformation to the cloud will differentiate our products by combining unique data assets, analytics and leading technology and will allow us to accelerate the speed of our new products to market in the ease which they\u2019re consumed by our customers. I\u2019ll talk a lot more about this in a minute when I discuss our technology transformation in more detail.","Number two. Being an industrial leader in data security, this is and will remain our \u2013 will remain central to our culture and our commitment. We made massive progress in the past 18 months and we still have more to do \u2013 more work to do. We are committed to be an industry leader on security.","Number three. Creating a culture of customer centricity. We talked on prior calls about how important this is to me, and this is how I operate as a business leader, and this starts by getting our people closer to customers, adding more feet on the street, our renewed focus on new verticals like FinTech, embedding our data scientist and Ignite technology with our customers on their sites, collaborating with customers in our DNA labs to do products that they need and embracing partners, the strength Equifax has and one that we are going to expand. All of these efforts are focused on accelerating innovation and growth, jointly with our customers, partners, to drive new products and to drive growth. This is an area which we\u2019re doubling down on.","Number four. Being a market leader in data analytics through leveraging unique data assets in the application of artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced visualization on the leading edge of delivery platforms is critical to our future. To be a market leader, we must with collaborate customers and partners broadly, and we must prioritize investment through the acquisition of new unique data sources. We have differentiated data assets like NC Plus and TWN where we will continue to invest heavily in new data sets organically and through M&A like with our data acquisition last summer and through partnerships. This is a critical priority.","Number five. Improve the consumer experience by providing value-added services through consumer centric digital and voice consumer support. We\u2019re building leading edge services and we will be rolling them out beginning in 2019 that will enhance our customer experience.","Number six. Bringing innovative new products to market in collaboration with our customers, leveraging our global data assets is always been a strength of Equifax. We are refocusing on our speed to market and leveraging products across our global footprint.","These six initiatives are all focused on driving revenue and profitable growth for our customers and our shareholders and returning Equifax to a growth mode and market leadership. To succeed on each of these initiatives, we are also refocused on our execution and delivery. Say do, that\u2019s how I operate. Making and meeting commitments. This was an Equifax strength and it will be again.","Shifting to the technology transformation we started in 2018. It\u2019s is critical to delivery of all of our strategic imperatives and it will provide us with substantial product delivery and cost advantages. Our EFX 2020 technology program is the largest investment program in Equifax history and is the complete focus of the entire leadership team. This is not a technology project. This is a technology and business led transformation of Equifax.","During the second half of 2018, we provided guidance that our security and technology investment plan would continue not only in 2018, but through 2019 and 2020. We also told you that we provide you a framework around our security and technology plan early in 2019 and we\u2019re going to do that today. In 2018, we spent $307 million and expect Equifax 2020 spending to continue during 2019 and 2020. We plan to spend $300 million this year in 2019. In 2020, the spend will be below our 2019 runway. Including incremental capital spending between 2018 and 2020, we will invest an incremental $1.25 billion to modernize our global technology and security infrastructure. We are convinced this will differentiate Equifax and move us back into a market leading position.","There\u2019s three basic principles that underpin our Equifax 2020 technology strategy that we\u2019re executing. First, cloud first and cloud native. This focus \u2013 this effort is focused on moving our legacy mainframe in server technology to the public cloud using native services provided by the public cloud providers to the greatest extent possible. This includes our network and transportation. From a security perspective, we will implement generally in virtual private clouds or private instances on the public cloud infrastructure.","Second, we\u2019re going to build on application services principles. This isn\u2019t a new concept, but it\u2019s is critical if we are successfully execute the cloud first and native technology strategy. In concept, this mean building services or components that can be easily assembled or interconnected using standard APIs. Again, this is not new, but it takes a tremendous amount of discipline to execute it.","Number three. Our relentless focus on rationalization. As we build our company for the future, it\u2019s critical that we remain focused on decommissioning our legacy data centers, applications, data platforms and servers. This will ensure we reached the robust security posture and long-term operational cost improvements we\u2019re committed to.","Number four, and most important is great talent. You\u2019ve heard me talk and us talk about our new technology team led by Bryson Koehler. Bryson has upgraded over 50% of his leadership team in the last six months with top talent from market-leading technology organizations. We\u2019re building the right team to execute this critical transformation.","We\u2019ve five major tracks to our technology transformation. These tracks underpinned by detailed resource plans and timelines are expected to be executed between 2019 and 2020. In the Investor Relations deck that we posted via our IR website this morning, we\u2019ve diagrams for these tracks. Here is a summary.","First, we will implement a common data fabric for data ingestion, governance, enrichment and management. The data fabric replaces our multiple current purpose-built data ingestion, cleansing and matching processes and systems, and the data exchanges themselves. For example, Acro, a U.S. credit exchange in the Work Number. Our data fabric is being built on the Google Go \u2013 Google Cloud platform in a virtual private cloud environment using Google\u2019s native tooling. By executing in its way, we can take advantage of Google\u2019s vast scale, and more importantly, the leading edge tools that are proven its scale and speed and that Google uses themselves.","Our new data fabric will conceptually be one repository as opposed to the many siloed databases that we have today. This single data fabric will deliver seamless real-time integration and data access across our many unique data sources. As I indicated, our data fabric is already in place with Google Cloud and in the first half of 2019, we\u2019ll be rolling that out. We\u2019ll have our U.S. ACRO credit exchange and TWN EWS exchange running in parallel with our current systems and available for multi-data insights in the first half of 2019.","Several of our other U.S. and EWS exchanges including NCTUE, IXI, DataX in an unemployment claims, as well as Ignite will migrate to the common data cloud fabric by the end of 2019. We will begin decommissioning existing exchanges that we have migrated to the data fabric in early 2020. We will continue this migration of our U.S. and global exchanges to the data fabric throughout 2020.","Second, we will rebuild or migrate our customer applications using standard application in cloud native services and operate them in the public cloud. Fortunately, this track is one Equifax started a number of years ago in 2016, with the initiation of InterConnect SaaS product, which is a set of application services that offers a global data gateway decisioning, using sparkling logic in an API framework. This continue with the launch of our Ignite application, which is a market-leading, analytical application that allows customers to easily Equifax third-party and their own attributes and data for analytics and modeling.","Over the past year, Equifax has worked to migrate these applications to a virtual private cloud utilizing cloud native services. We are also making great progress in integrating Ignite and InterConnect app services to allow customers to seamlessly promote attribution models defined in Ignite, including those driven by machine learning into production on InterConnect. We\u2019re working to make this broadly available by the end of the first quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we completed implementation of Ignite Direct and InterConnect in a virtual private cloud in Europe and Latin America.","Deployments of Ignite Direct with InterConnect in U.S., Canada and Asia-Pacific are to be completed in the first quarter of 2019. Ignite marketplace was deployed for all regions in 2018 and is expected to be cloud native by the later part of 2019. This same process will be followed to build new applications or migrate existing applications going forward.","Third, we will migrate customers from legacy decisioning systems, interface systems and Ignite instances to InterConnect SaaS and Ignite in the cloud. Globally, Equifax has over 4,000 customers operating on an Equifax decisioning or analytical system. Over 2019 and 2020, we expect to migrate the vast majority of these customers to standard InterConnect SaaS and Ignite cloud applications. In USIS, we expect to migrate 60% of our customers by the end of 2019 with the vast majority of customers migrating by the end of 2020. Similar plans are in place for each region around the globe.","Fourth, we will migrate our global consumer systems and customer and consumer support systems using standard application services and cloud data services and operate them on the public cloud. Fortunately, this is also attractive as we started several years ago. Our new consumer system that will include digital consumer support called, Renaissance, is in the process of being migrated to a virtual private cloud environment utilizing cloud data services. We launched Renaissance in Canada in the fourth quarter and will launch in the U.S. in mid-2019. Separately, we are deploying sales force in Genesis for customer and consumer support worldwide. We expect significant deployment of all these systems to be ongoing throughout 2019.","Last, we\u2019ll move corporate in some of our business support applications to SaaS services and public cloud. For example, Equifax will be moving its email and collaboration to Google Gmail during the early part of 2019. Oracle Financial Systems will operate on EWS in the second quarter and our sales management applications will be moved to the sales force cloud between 2019 and 2020. I hope this gives you a sense of the pace and urgency of our technology transformation, as well as the measurable and real progress we are already making as we deliver new cloud-based technology to our customers. As I referenced earlier, diagrams of these tracks are provided on our Investor Relations deck on our website.","During 2019, we plan to have our new technology leader Bryson Koehler provide more details to you around our Equifax 2020 technology plan, and John will provide some more details on the cost estimates to execute this plan in his portion of the presentation this morning. All of these actions are being executed consistent with our commitment to be a leader in data analytics and technology. We\u2019re convinced that this a transformational investment for Equifax.","And I want to make it clear one more time. This is not a technology refresh. We are changing how the way we operate, the way we go to market, in the way we serve our customers through technology. We made strong steps forward in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll continue our efforts in 2019 and 2020 as we complete elements of our multi-year plan on a monthly basis going forward.","As we discussed on the last call and to align with our strategic goals, we did make some structural changes within Equifax, focused on driving more of our resources and decision-making closer to customers and further optimizing our resource structure. As you may recall, in August, we realigned our resources and decision-making to move our organization closer to market \u2013 market-facing business unit teams and away from headquarters. This is an important element of how I operate of having our teams closer and more focused with our customers.","In the fourth quarter, we completed a plan to optimize our G&A and headquarters costs. In connection with these activities, we took a one-time charge in the fourth quarter of $46 million. While these actions are expected to improve our margins, we plan to reinvest some of the cost savings into more DNA resources and more sales resources to drive growth. We\u2019re also moving to embed more of our commercial and DNA resources in our customers\u2019 locations to further drive engagement, service and growth. Net full year run rate savings from this fourth quarter action are expected to exceed $50 million. I\u2019m energized about the steps we\u2019re taking to move our organization closer to customers and markets.","Shifting to new product innovation. This remains a key priority and a real Equifax strength. We have an active pipeline of new product introductions with over 100 new products at various stages in the funnel and we launched 61 new products last year, consistent with the number we launched in 2017 and 2016. And as we talked on prior calls, protecting the resources and technology resources around NPI was critical to us in 2018. NPI and new product growth is a real strength and focus of Equifax.","I talked about the growth potential Workforce Solutions being in the second inning, a reference to the amount of run rate \u2013 runway they have in front of them to grow their database as well as provide innovative new solutions. Recently, Workforce Solutions identified two new use cases for their Work Number. The first use is our data with consumer consent to allow for enhanced identity matching. Identity matching has become an increasingly challenging issue for most of our customers and have a unique data assets like the Work Number is improving our customers\u2019 processes and workflow and allowing consumers to more easily obtain the services and benefits they need.","The second new use case, also using our verification data, help FinTech customers and the online digital lending customers provide a frictionless and superior consumer lending experience by providing better lending decisions in a streamlined and automated manner. As our FinTech and online lending customers look to expand lending to near and subprime customers, while controlling for risk, our new Work Number database provides meaningful data to make better decisions, benefiting both consumers and our customers.","So now let me shift gears and take a look at 2019 guidance. For 2019, we expect total revenue to be between $3.425 billion and $3.525 billion, reflecting currency revenue growth of 2% to 5%. This assumes the U.S. mortgage market will decline about 5% in 2019 or about 1% headwind to our revenue growth. FX will negatively impact revenue adjusted EPS by just over 100 basis points. USIS revenue expected to be up slightly in 2019, including the approximately 150 basis point negative impact from the U.S. mortgage market decline. First half growth will be more negatively impacted by the mortgage decline from a comparison standpoint.","EWS revenue growth will strengthen from 2018 with growth approaching 10%. Verification Services, we expect to deliver very strong growth and employer services flat to up slightly. International revenue growth will grow about 5%. First half growth being impacted by continued weakness in Australia lending markets and the Argentinean economy, and we are expecting to return to high-single digit growth in the second half of 2019.","And lastly, GCS revenue will be flat in 2019. First half revenue will decline year-over-year and we expect to return to growth in the second half of 2019 based on the new efforts that we have in marketing inside of that business. For 2019, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $5.60 and $5.80 per share, reflecting constant currency improvement of about 1.75% to down 1.75%.","We expect to see expanded business unit EBITDA margins of about 50 basis points, led by nice revenue growth and margin growth at Workforce, to drive increased operating profit and EBITDA dollars from business units. Offsetting our increased margins are really three principal factors: number one, higher corporate costs of about $25 million, principally in security and related technology investments; second, increased interest expense of about $5 million reflecting the refinancing executed midway through 2018; and third, a slightly higher tax rate of 24% in 2019. John will provide more details on our guidance, EFX 2020, investment plans for 2019 and 2020, as well as a significant market factors impacting the first half of 2019.","Wrapping up. Equifax has made strong progress in 2018 in regaining the trust of our customers and partners. We moved back to a growth mode with our customers. And we completed the first phase of our three-year EFX 2020 transformation plan. We are confident that we\u2019re moving in the right direction, but we know we still have a lot of work to do. We\u2019re investing at record levels to make Equifax a market leader in data analytics, technology and security. We\u2019re excited about our future and the opportunities ahead.","With that, let me turn it over to John.","John Gamble","Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. As Trevor mentioned, we have excluded certain items from our GAAP results in order to calculate adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS. We\u2019ve provided the details on these items in our earnings release, so you can consider them in your analysis.","As Mark covered our overall results and the business unit details, I\u2019ll cover overall margin, some corporate items, and provide the additional detail on our guidance. In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $168 million. Excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the cybersecurity incident and the costs associated with the realignment of internal resources, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $76 million, up $23 million from 4Q 2017.","The increase principally reflects three items: increased investment in security and transformation and related technologies; increased variable compensation reflecting the reduced compensation in 4Q 2017, following the cyber attack; and cost of Lock and Alert, the free consumer service launched in 2018.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.2% in 4Q 2018, down 160 basis points from 4Q 2017. The business unit adjusted EBITDA margin in total were up 50 basis points, as Workforce and the international, both grew EBITDA margins nicely year-to-year and USIS saw other margins increased sequentially. The decline in adjusted EBITDA margins is principally due to the increases in corporate cost I just discussed, as well as lower GCS margins as we have started to advertise.","For 4Q 2018, the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 21.4%. In our 4Q guidance in October, we indicated that we expected our 4Q 2018 effective tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be about 24%. The lower tax rate reflects the reduction in our ongoing foreign tax rate due to recently issued guidance concerning the 2017 Tax Act, as well as the year-to-date catch up in 4Q 2018. The benefit between the 21.4% effective tax rate achieved and 24% was a benefit of about $0.04 a share. For 1Q 2019 and calendar year 2019, we expect our effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS to be about 24%. Our effective tax rate for adjusted EPS in 2018 was 22.6%.","Now turning to 2019, I\u2019d like to provide some details on the guidance Mark provided and some perspective on the changes from 2018. A few important assumptions underpinning our 2019 guidance: FX is expected to negatively impact by just over 1% and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.08 a share. The greatest impact on revenue will be in the first and second quarter at negative 3% and 2% respectively. U.S. mortgage market inquiries for all of 2019 are expected to decline about 5%.","1Q 2019 increase are expected to be weak, down about 13%, just slightly better than we saw in 4Q 2018. 2Q 2019 increase are expected to be down mid-single digits and we expect increase to continue to improve, getting to be about flat in 3Q and slightly positive in 4Q. The impact of the mortgage market on Equifax growth is significant in the first half of 2019, impacting total revenue negatively by about 2.5% and 1% in 1Q and 2Q respectively, and then becoming positive in 4Q just under one point.","For USIS, the impact is more significant, impacting revenue growth negatively by just over 4% and about 1% in 1Q and 2Q respectively, and positively by about 1% in the fourth quarter. The impact on Workforce is negative about 3% and 1.5% in 1Q and 2Q respectively, and positive about 1% in the fourth quarter.","Australian credit markets are expected to stay weak through Q2 2019, and then begin to improve in the second half. We\u2019re assuming Argentina\u2019s economic crisis will continue through 2Q and then begin to abate in the second half with the economy remaining weak throughout the year. The weakness in Australia and Argentina through the first half are expected to impact International revenue growth negatively by about 2% in the first half of the year.","As we look to our guidance for 2019, these market factors, specifically the U.S. mortgage market, and Australia and Argentina market conditions, have a substantial negative impact on 1Q 2019 and 2Q 2019 constant currency revenue growth. 1Q and 2Q revenue growth are negatively impacted by roughly 3% and 1.5% respectively with this impact expected to actually swing positive \u2013 slightly positive by 4Q.","This also impacts adjusted EPS. If we are looking at 1Q 2019, the negative three percentage points of revenue impact versus 1Q 2018, is about $25 million of revenue. At Equifax, average gross profit that revenue reduction impacts operating profit by more than $15 million.","Three additional factors are impacting quarterly timing and total 2019 results. The quarterly timing of corporate expenses in 2019, as Mark indicated, corporate expenses are expected to increase by \u2013 in 2019 by about $25 million, principally in the first half. The increase is primarily in higher security and related technology costs. These cost ramp significantly during 2018, reaching a run rate in the second half. In the first half of 2019, we are seeing significant increases year-to-year as we are now operating at the higher run rate we reached in the second half of 2018.","2019 full year variable and equity comp is up versus 2018, as 2018 variable comp paid out below target and 2019 long-term incentives have been adjusted to support execution over the period of our technology transformation. Additionally, in the first half of 2018, we did not have a full executive leadership team. So equity comp increases are principally in the first half of 2019. We have also increased our investments in data and analytics in 2019 relative to 2018. In total, these increases are partially offset by reduced cost and corporate staff, such as finance, marketing and HR. Approximately, $15 million of the $25 million increase in corporate expenses will be in the first quarter of 2019.","Global consumer performance in 1Q 2019 will be down, as in 1Q 2018, U.S. consumer direct revenue was still at relatively high levels, and we had stopped U.S. marketing spend. This will result in 1Q 2019 revenue being down about $5 million and operating profit down about $8 million year-to-year. GCS performance relative to 2018 is expected to improve each quarter in 2019 and we believe show growth as we exit the year. The savings from the cost actions taken in 4Q 2018 will increase as we move through 2019, as well as the planned actions \u2013 as the planned actions are completed. Savings in 1Q 2019 are just under $10 million.","The increase in our 2019 effective tax rate for adjusted EPS is 24%, reflects the discrete benefits received in 2018 that we do not believe will occur in 2019. We believe our run rate \u2013 tax rate is slightly lower in 2019 than 2018. For 1Q 2019, we expect revenue in the range of $840 million to $855 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of flat to up just under 2%.","We\u2019re expecting adjusted EPS to be $1.15 to $1.20 per share. FX is approximately negative 3% on revenue on 1Q 2019, and negatively impacting adjusted EPS by $0.05 a share. The combination of the market factors impacting revenue and the timing of corporate expenses, cost actions savings and global consumer are impacting 1Q 2019 revenue by about $30 million, operating profit by about $30 million, and adjusted EPS by almost $0.20 a share. As a reminder, these factors are expected to diminish somewhat in the second quarter and actually be a year-to-year positive as we get to the fourth quarter. These factors, as well as increased interest expense of about $0.02 per share is what is driving the decline in adjusted EPS in 1Q 2019.","In 2019, we expect to incur approximately $350 million in non-recurring expenses, $300 million in non-recurring security and technology transformation, and $50 million related to legal and regulatory. This does not include the cost of any potential judgments or other outcomes should they occur. For the status of the legal and regulatory matters, I would refer you to our 10-K.","Mark provided a perspective on total incremental spending on security and technology transformation over the 2018 to 2020 period. In that calculation, we include the expense on non-recurring security and technology transformation and the incremental capital spending defined as any spending above the $214 million per year we spent in 2017. For 2018, the total incremental spend was about $460 million, and our guidance for 2019 is about $450 million. Beyond 2020, we will not exclude non-recurring security and technology transformation expenses from our adjusted EPS.","And with that, operator, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos","Great. Good morning guys. So, just to kind of kick things off on the guidance, the 2% to 5% outlook for 2019, that high-end is a little higher than what we were thinking, which is good to see. So just wanted to get a sense of what you\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, kind of competitively? How things are shaping up if you\u2019re seeing any sort of changes in some of your key verticals for macro? And then maybe just related to that, I mean to hit that 5%, if you hit the top end given the zero to two you\u2019re starting with, I mean, that would suggest that your growth rate is almost kind of going back to sort of the historic target that you would put out there. How comfortable are you with that?","Mark Begor","Yes. I think, George, it\u2019s Mark here, and John will jump into it. I think you have to look at the pieces of the business obviously. I think you understand EWS pretty well and we\u2019ve been pretty clear that they\u2019re kind of coming out of the fourth quarter quite strong with the record growth that they have. So, there\u2019s a lot of confidence in their growth going forward. GCS is another one that John and I talked about, the kind of sequential improvement in that is going to drive that revenue growth as we go into the fourth quarter and as you know, it was a drag in 2018.","International, Australia is clearly a pressure for that business in the kind of latter part of 2018. We expect that to continue through the first couple of quarters of 2019, but then we start getting into a comparison, where it started to decline in September last year that will be helpful from a year-over-year standpoint.","And then really the USIS business I think is where you\u2019re probably focusing your question is, their recovery going forward in \u2013 we continue to see positive pipeline builds, there\u2019s more discussions in the marketplace, we\u2019re really out of the penalty box with all of our customers that kind of happened months ago and we\u2019re back into a more normal mode with NPI and everything else that we have going on.","At the same time, I would say that range reflects, we\u2019re cautious about that recovery and that\u2019s why we want to be clear about that \u2013 that recovery has been unpredictable. They\u2019ve got the headwind of mortgage that again starts comping out in the second half of next year, where we expect the declines to abate and that helps from a year-over-year comparison, but the USIS recovery is one that we\u2019re convinced is going to happen. We see signs of it. You look at the fourth quarter performance ex mortgage, we\u2019re pleased with that for USIS and we expect that to continue going forward and the range we try to put in place is to show that there\u2019s some predictability challenges, primarily in USIS. What would you add, John?","John Gamble","Yes. I think Mark covered it very fully. Just one other fact to be aware of, right. If you look at the fourth quarter and you exclude GCS, even with a very weak mortgage market, we had 4% growth again in the other three large businesses. So again, what we think we\u2019re seeing is continued progress, because holding it 4% given that the substantial degradation in the mortgage market, we think again those show that we\u2019re continuing to see progress in the three main businesses.","And as Mark said, we do expect to see GCS to substantially better as you get into the end of next year, not because that\u2019s driving lots of growth, they\u2019re simply lapping a lower level of revenues you get in the second half and we\u2019re just expecting that we\u2019re going to start to see subscribers kind of flatten out as they can in our market. So, as we said, we do have a broad range still in our guidance, but those are the factors driving us forward.","George Mihalos","That\u2019s great. Really appreciate the color. And just as a quick follow-up, maybe on the margin front. I think you guys talked about the business units expanding margins by about 50 bps. Any sort of color you can kind of give on a segment level, and then just a point of clarity. It looks like what you\u2019re saying is from an adjusted EBITDA perspective that EBITDA margins will be, call it, flat to somewhat up, given some of the commentary around tax and interest expense working against you? Thanks.","John Gamble","Yes. So as Mark said, looking at the business units, we expect them to be up. It\u2019s really being driven by EWS. EWS is going \u2013 we expect to have a nice year, verifier is going to grow very strong, and as you know, verifier revenue is very, very rich in margin. We\u2019re also expecting to see international to be up slightly. USIS margin performance, we think is going to be better than it was this year. It may not be up, but we\u2019re expecting to see much better performance than we saw this year. And GCS, they\u2019re going to be down. We said we\u2019re going to start advertising, so you\u2019re going to see declines. But when you add that all up, we think that\u2019s why we get some comfort that we\u2019re looking at BU margins that are better, again as you look across the range of our guidance that are flattish to up. So we think that\u2019s absolutely a positive sign.","Corporate expense, high in the first quarter, right, and it\u2019s high into the first quarter, because of equity. So, you\u2019re seeing corporate expense on an absolute basis should actually decline as you go through the year, because of the fact that the \u2013 our equity and variable comp is so much higher in the first half \u2013 in first quarter, sorry.","And the other thing that benefits us quite honestly is first quarter revenue historically, and this quarter is low. So as revenue grows, the margin effect of those fixed costs in corporate that we\u2019re talking about actually goes down, and that benefits our margins as we go through the year. So you get \u2013 you get kind of merge all that together and I think that\u2019s how you get the improving margin performance we\u2019re talking about through the year. Hey, there are risks; Mark talked about them. The biggest risk obviously is sector information. We need to execute for that to be \u2013 for us to be successful on our margins and as we move more and more things to the cloud, those costs will certainly start to affect us, but net-net, we think \u2013 we think that I covered it pretty full.","George Mihalos","Great.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning. My first question, John, maybe you could just help us understand what the free cash flow dynamics are, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces. Can you just talk about what CapEx should be and how we should think about conversion to free cash flow broadly for the next two years?","John Gamble","Yes. So, I\u2019m not going to go out to two years, right. But in terms of CapEx, I think CapEx for next year \u2013 this year, sorry 2019, we\u2019re expecting it to be kind of flat, right, with this year. The other dynamic that you\u2019re going to see in 2019 is that we don\u2019t really have the insurance proceeds recovery, but importantly, as you look at 2018, and obviously, we published our cash flow, the nice thing that you see is our net debt position actually improved as we went through the year. And even with the increased CapEx that substantially increased obviously non-recurring technology investments, as well as some small acquisitions we are able to continue to keep the balance sheet very strong and since we think our operating performance is somewhat consistent in 2019 versus 2018, as well as we\u2019re talking about some lower levels of overall spending in 2019 slightly on the technology transformation, we would expect that we would be able to maintain a good balance sheet position as we go through 2019 as well.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And Mark, just I guess a broader question. I mean there\u2019s obviously a lot of change, lot of transformation, like you said many times, have to happen, I mean, it\u2019s pretty quick compared to, I guess, what we\u2019ve at least seen before. How do you plan around this to avoid any hiccups? I mean, what\u2019s the \u2013 what\u2019s the game plan there broadly and how you\u2019re going to structure this?","Mark Begor","Yes, Manav, it\u2019s a great question. As you might imagine that lost on me and the rest of the leadership team. This is a massive undertaking on our part, it\u2019s one that you have to execute well and what are we doing about it? First, it starts with having great people and I talked about the rebuild of our technology and security organization, and we brought in really talented people that have done this before. Our new technology leader did a full legacy mainframe conversion to cloud it \u2013 in its prior business in 18 months. Now, we\u2019re not going to do that quickly, but he\u2019s been there, done that, knows how to do it, he brought in a team to make it happen. So that\u2019s point number one.","Point number two is just real rigor around the execution. We have very detailed plans. I\u2019ll try to give you a flavor of that on the call this morning. And you know the other flavor I try to give you is this like things are rolling. We started really this technology transformation in a big way, ramped up in the middle of last year, and we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of that, meaning, things are being delivered to the marketplace in the fourth quarter, the stuff happening \u2013 happened in January and February. So, real cadence of delivering these application upgrades.","And third is really partnering with the very best. And we talk to a lot of the cloud providers and we use really all of them in different way, shape or form, but I think I highlighted in the call that we\u2019re really focused on partnering with Google, just because of their capabilities, the quality of their cloud, the depth of the cloud is really important to us. So people, real rigor in the process, John and I, and the leadership team, have a regular cadence of looking at the projects of how are they being delivered, are they on cost, are they on budget, are they on time? Okay they\u2019re installed; they\u2019re in the cloud onto the next one. So there\u2019s that kind of rigor around it. But we\u2019re on it is really the approach that I have and it starts with people.","Manav Patnaik","All right. That\u2019s great.","John Gamble","Manav, on your question to me, I just want to make sure I was clear. My commentary doesn\u2019t include the \u2013 any impact on the outcome of the regulatory or legal matters that are ongoing. Obviously, those would be on top of \u2013 those cash outflows will be on top of anything I just said.","Manav Patnaik","Got it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning. Once you get to the end of Equifax 2020, where do you think you\u2019re going to be most differentiated versus your two primary competitors in terms of major product and service offerings?","Mark Begor","Yes, it starts \u2013 to start with, we believe that our speed to market of both ingesting data more quickly, having it easier access by our customers and then really a differentiator is going to be speed of getting new products to market. Today, we\u2019re slower than we\u2019d like to be, for sure and that becomes a competitive disadvantage if your competitors are faster than you are and we really believe this is going to leapfrog in that element, and then the other is going to be costs.","Moving these legacy applications to the cloud is we\u2019ve talked many times, we have multiple versions of the same application, we\u2019re going to consolidate to one, then we\u2019re going to move that to the cloud. And then when it\u2019s in the cloud, we can also leverage it across the 24 countries we operate in and not recreate it in each market that we\u2019re in, so that cost leverage is going to be a massive to us. And you actually touched on probably the third leg on this speed, cost, it\u2019s really going to be what are the features and having a differentiated access to our data could be revenue upside.","Today, to access some of our multiple siloed database is doable. We have products that bridge across that and technology. When we have that single data fabric, we\u2019re convinced that that\u2019s going to allow our customers and us to really access the wide array of differentiated data we have more easily.","David Togut","Understood. And then once you finish this transformation at the end of 2020, what does the Equifax growth model look like in terms of organic revenue growth, margin expansion, capital allocation, bottom-line growth?","Mark Begor","Yes, David, you probably know from prior calls. We\u2019ve been crystal clear that we\u2019re not prepared to put a long-term framework back in place. We want to do that, we will do that, but there has been a couple of things that we\u2019ve been quite clear about that are going to be important to us to really get nailed down before we\u2019re prepared to do that.","First is really seeing a path on our legal and regulatory settlement framework and we don\u2019t have a \u2013 we don\u2019t have that framework today. So that\u2019s the one that\u2019s important to us to have real clarity on for you and us before we put a long-term framework in place. Number two is really this technology plan and we\u2019re \u2013 we made massive progress in the last six months about getting this plan laid out. We still got some work to do around; really deeply quantifying the financial benefits on top and bottom line. So that\u2019s still on our to-do list, but that\u2019s something that we need to complete to put that inside of our long-term framework.","And then third is really USIS, and really seeing some consistency of their return to growth. We\u2019ve seen positive performance kind of quarterly in 2018, that\u2019s been masked somewhat by the headwind that they have in the U.S. mortgage market, but seeing that consistency of recovery from USIS is important to us. So when those three are in place, we\u2019re going to be ready to put our long-term framework back out there.","David Togut","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, Mark. Do you see Equifax\u2019s perspective revenue, organic revenue growth acceleration as a zero-sum situation? With the other credit bureaus or do you more see kind of unique offerings to Equifax during your sales pipeline and so really kind of just, I would say, growth opportunities to Equifax?","Mark Begor","Andrew, as you know, it\u2019s probably a mix of the two. We compete hard just like the other guys do for business and we\u2019re out there doing it. We had competitive wins in the last couple of months that I would say you\u2019re \u2013 you could characterize them as zero-sum game. That\u2019s one where we move from secondary to primary, whatever, and our competitors are trying to do that to us every day, and that was happening before the breach and you and I have talked a couple of times during 2018.","But there\u2019s some unique aspects of our business. When you think about our EWS business, that\u2019s one that\u2019s quite unique. Our competitors don\u2019t have a business like that, and that business growing at the rate it\u2019s growing. I wouldn\u2019t characterize that as a zero-sum game, because it\u2019s really different. You said it\u2019s different markets, et cetera, and our competitors have businesses that we don\u2019t compete with their segments. So, I would say it\u2019s a mix of the two.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","John Gamble","The other place is international, right. Our international footprint very different than our competitors. So, our opportunity to grow there is different than theirs.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Mark Begor","Maybe, Andrew, just to add an example, I think we\u2019ve talked before in meetings with you and I about the FinTech space. That\u2019s an example, where it\u2019s a mix of the two. We historically didn\u2019t have the presence that we should have there. Our competitors were much more aggressive commercially. We changed that in 2018. But there is also the element that I talked about in my comments earlier of taking our TWN data assets to the FinTech space is something that\u2019s quite differentiated, our competitors don\u2019t have there. So that\u2019s a great example, where we hope to have some competitive wins in FinTech as we go into 2019, and we\u2019re working on it as we speak, but we\u2019re also bringing new data assets there that we\u2019re really just helping that customer set like others, improve their decisioning.","Andrew Steinerman","Well said. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jeff Goldstein","Hi. This is Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. I know you\u2019ve previously talked about a $0.40 a share impact from ongoing IT and security, and increased insurance costs relates to the breach. Is that still the expectation baked into the 2019 guidance or has that number moved that all?","Mark Begor","Yes. So, we\u2019re looking forward to 2019, a part of what\u2019s happened, right, part of what we\u2019ve talked about when we talk about the first quarter, we have increased security cost is because we\u2019re lapping the increase in those costs in 2019 from 2018. So, we\u2019re certainly seeing those increases and those increases are continuing and we would expect to see security costs continue to rise, but the \u2013 the very large increase that we saw during 2018 and the big one-time step-up in insurance costs, those things occurred in 2018. And so we shouldn\u2019t see the same type of step in 2019, but we will still incur those costs.","Jeff Goldstein","Got it. And then understanding, you said CapEx will be flat year-over-year, but how should we be thinking about the run rate figure of that beyond 2020. Is it back to more like 5% of sales number that occurred before 2017 or is 9% of sales is a better way to think about it given kind of the new Equifax you\u2019re trying to create? Thanks.","John Gamble","So, I think about all we can say at this point is when the transfer maintenance is complete; the CapEx numbers should certainly decline. To give you the exact number, it\u2019s way premature, but it should certainly decline.","Mark Begor","And I think that also, Jeff, you kind of leading into our financial framework, which we\u2019re not prepared to talk about on a long-term basis, but I think John comment \u2013 the investment that we\u2019re making should result in that coming down in the future, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to talk about what that is yet.","Jeff Goldstein","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thanks. Hey, you talked about being out of the penalty box with your customers, any sense of \u2013 what kind of the revenue lost on that was in 2018 versus 2017, so we can get a sense of what that opportunities as we scale back into 2019?","John Gamble","Yes. I think you could probably do the math with USIS\u2019s historical growth rate was kind of pre-cybersecurity incident and where it was in 2018 adjourn, it was obviously quite significant.","Mark Begor","You saw our growth and you saw our competitors\u2019 growth, right? So, there was a quite a significant difference, but for us to quantify specifically, that would be very difficult.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay. And then just in terms of the legal and regulatory framework, any sense of from a timing perspective, when that all gets wrapped up?","John Gamble","We put some expanded detail into our 10-K on our regulatory and legal matters, and I\u2019d encourage you to take a look at that disclosure in there, which has a lot of detail about where we stand on that.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the discussion of the technology, I guess. How is that plan that you laid out \u2013 did that change meaningfully after pricing came in, I guess, or just in the last three to six months that you kind of move forward with the process. Is that plan any different than in the past? Just trying to understand how it\u2019s developing?","Mark Begor","Dramatically different. When you think about 2018, the first half of 2018, our focus was really on doing a lot of security remediation improvements and all that. And Bryson joined us, his team started to join us. He changed out about half of the team as we roll through the second half of 2018 and his focus was really on helping us refine a plan that is what we talked about today. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I would characterize it is dramatically different given his experience, his teams\u2019 experience, there are lessons learned of doing this before. He has really shaped the plan that we\u2019ve put in place.","And again, we try to give you a flavor this morning that is detailed that there\u2019s real ownership around specific projects. It\u2019s not like nothing is going to happen between now and 2020, there\u2019s stuff happening every week, meeting deliverable to the marketplace, and I\u2019ll give you a lot of color on things moving in to the cloud in the fourth quarter, in December and January, just kind to keep pacing through. We\u2019ve got a very deliberate and very focused planned to really drive this transformation over the three-year period, but going forward, over the next 22 months in 2019 and 2020.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And on the Verification business, that business seemed to get stronger, I think as you said, at year-end. And I know you talked about new record growth. So, two aspects to the question there. One is why has new record growth been as strong as it is? Are they finding different types of sources to get the data? And secondly, is there another factor, I guess, that maybe as it \u2013 are they new kind of use cases, are they really meaningfully moving the needle at this point in terms of the booking...","Mark Begor","You hit both nails on the head, that\u2019s their business model. And you know, they\u2019ve invested heavily in their technology in the last 12 months or so to make it easier for what I would characterize the next year of companies to more easily connect to EWS and provide their data assets, so that\u2019s one, meaning that they\u2019re kind of mid-market customers or companies that have 1,000 employees or 2,000 employees versus 20,000, making it easier for them to commit. As we pointed out, we added more records in the fourth quarter than we have in last five years. I think it\u2019s similar on the number of companies that are now partnering meeting. We\u2019re really ramping that up. So that\u2019s point number one. And inside of that more record growth is just an increased focus in success on partnerships, where we\u2019re working with other payroll providers to have a partnership around getting data from that source as opposed to directly from the company.","And then you hit the nail on the head the second side, which is more use cases, whether it\u2019s government that, it\u2019s one that grew for us strong double digits in 2018. We expect that to continue in 2019, meaning, above the average. And just other use cases as we continue to take that growing asset. And then lastly, as I mentioned, and you know this that when we added data \u2013 another data record there, another payroll record this afternoon, it monetized tomorrow morning. As just the hit rates go up, the monetization is very, very rapid as you grow that.","So, we\u2019ve got a very strong focus and Rudy has a very strong team focused on adding those data assets, and of course, he\u2019s got vertical owners and commercial teams out there, building out how the data is used and how it can help in decisioning in lots of different industry segments. You guys \u2013 you know this is a great Equifax business.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey John, there is just an inherent difficulty in projecting pipeline conversion when you go through a situation, where you have whether it was like a gap and then you had to kind of restart projects and stuff like that. Where do you \u2013 how do you feel right now in terms of your ability to forecast their pipeline conversion given the pace of the sales that are going on in the implementations?","John Gamble","Well, you\u2019re clearly correct. Right, as you look through 2018, our ability to forecast our revenue was not nearly as good as it\u2019s been historically. And I think we\u2019ve talked about quite consistently the fact that we expected it to be choppy, right. Our conversion was choppy and our ability to forecast that was choppy. But we feel a little better this quarter than we did last quarter, because if you take a look at fourth quarter performance, really that what we missed based \u2013 really heavily based on the mortgage market. And I go back out to the impact of the mortgage market, and we were fairly good in terms of the revenue forecast that we have for the company, a little bit of weakness \u2013 a little more weakness in Australia than we guess, but other than that, I think \u2013 but relatively good. So we feel a little better given the performance in the fourth quarter, but we also accept, one quarter does not a trend make. So we are focused on getting better. We think our pipeline conversions are improving. We saw way better conversions in sales of batch jobs in USIS in the fourth quarter. All things that give us comfort, that things are getting better and our predictability is improving. But we do caution people that still it\u2019s going to be choppy and it should be less choppy as we move through 2019 and as we get back toward the end of 2019 as Mark talked about with the expected improvement in performance, we\u2019re expecting to start feeling a lot more normal. We would hope as we get toward the end of 2019.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, thanks. And then just \u2013 when you are trying to forecast the mortgage market, are you putting a certain inherent conservatism in there, just as we ran the MBA application index for quarter-to-date last night, it sort of looked like, if you just kind of carry that forward where we are. You would actually have much better mortgage, I guess you could call it \u2013 less of a headwind in the first quarter and much better pickup in the rest of the year. Is there something where just given your experience you\u2019re stepping that back a little bit?","Mark Begor","So, we actually use inquiries. So, in theory, at what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re trending the actual inquiries we received, which I don\u2019t think you have access to. So, we \u2013 that\u2019s the index we use. And since we see all inquiries, we think that\u2019s probably relevant in period. So in period, that\u2019s the basis going forward. We use three or four different sources for a third-party input on what we expect to happen with the overall mortgage market, and then we trend the inquiries from that point going forward. So, it\u2019s not only mortgage origination that you\u2019re seeing, but we\u2019re also seeing the impact of whether people are shopping more or less and we try to build that into the forecast.","We would really admit forecast in the mortgage market is difficult, it\u2019s difficult for \u2013 I think everybody, but certainly difficult for us. We think what we have is a reasonable trend and showing reasonable improvement, but obviously, if the mortgage market gets better, faster, we\u2019ll get the benefit of that, right. If it stays weaker, we\u2019ll see that as well, it\u2019s pretty direct.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","All right. Thank you very much. And John, I just want to comment, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard the CFO summarizes guidance by saying merge that all together.","Mark Begor","You don\u2019t know John well enough then.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. You acquired DataX earlier in 3Q. Can you tell us what the organic growth was in USIS in the fourth quarter?","Mark Begor","So, the impact of DataX was on the order of less than a point, right?","George Tong","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019d like to go back to ongoing data security and insurance costs in the business, you indicated that the step-up in 2019 should be smaller than in 2018. Can you quantify how much in ongoing breach-related costs are embedded into your 2019 guidance?","John Gamble","So, we tried to give two numbers okay. We did indicate that we were going to see continued increases in security. We didn\u2019t try to quantify and this is our run rate, what\u2019s included in adjusted EPS. So, I didn\u2019t quantify a specific number and I think what I could say is, we reached run rate and we\u2019re probably now going to see more normal growth in security spend and security spend growth rates are high, right. So, you should expect to see us grow our security spend like \u2013 like many companies would, but not have the significant step-ups we saw in 2018.","In terms of our other spend embedded in our technology transformation is obviously investments that certainly improved securities. So, we separately gave a number around the tech transformation spend of about $300 million this year, which is down slightly from 2000 \u2013 from 2018. That is not \u2013 that is not just security in anyway, but the security spend that\u2019s non-recurring would be embedded in that number.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Mark Begor","Thanks, George.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff","Good morning, guys, and thanks for the additional detail on the strategic and tech plan. That\u2019s helpful. Two questions related to that. Number one is, as you go through that tech refresh or the tech transformation, it\u2019s substantial as you\u2019ve talked about, how do you interact with your clients on that, and I guess, I\u2019m thinking. If I\u2019m a client and I want to partake in some of this new technology, does it take me longer to test it or am I going along in testing it with you. How does that \u2013 does that elongate kind of somebody consuming a new product? That\u2019s question number one. And then number two, and I\u2019ll get off. Is there any \u2013 I know that you guys put a lot of thought in this. So have you dialed this into how management team or even a couple layers down are compensated related to that? So thanks for those thoughts. Appreciate it.","Mark Begor","Yes, great question, Brett. First on the migration, you hit on the head that in some regards, that\u2019s the most challenging part of this process is moving your customers from a legacy platform to one of the new platforms and that\u2019s not new for us. We\u2019ve been doing that for a long time, because we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been constantly upgrading our technology. Our focus is to make it easy for our customers, to make sure that the new application is going to provide value-added services to them, and then we\u2019re going to work with them in their cycle. You know they\u2019re going to have specific cycles about when they\u2019re ready to make a migration or a change given their technology plan. So, we\u2019ll be \u2013 we are dialoguing. It\u2019s not a new muscle for us; we\u2019ve been doing it before with our customers and really working through that migration process going forward.","On your second question around the incentives, you hit on a really important point. As you might imagine, you\u2019ve got a leadership team here, an organization that is incented to run and grow the business, but at the same time, we\u2019re going to change the tires on the car, whatever the right analogy is, doing a technology transformation. So, the answer is yes, we have put in some specific incentives with the leadership team around the EFX 2020 transformation. We think that\u2019s really important to have them aligned. With that, this massive project as well as aligned with our investors around that project going forward.","And then lastly, that we put a security metric in place in our cash bonus plan in 2018, we\u2019re continuing that in 2019. We think that focus around the security incentive is the right one. I think you know we\u2019re the only companies out there that has this kind of a metric and the way it works is in \u2013 we\u2019ve got 3,000 people that are in our AIP bonus plan, and there is \u2013 the 25% of that bonus is tied to the organizations and individuals progress around security and it\u2019s only punitive.","So meaning, if we don\u2019t meet our security goals, which we did last year, so there was no takeaway in 2018, but we don\u2019t meet them in 2019, there could be a metric there. Other big believer in aligning people and the organization around what our goals are. So, we\u2019ve got very good goals around growth and financial incentives. We\u2019ve got the security goal and then we\u2019ve added this EFX 2020 incentive to align the organization around this technology transformation.","Brett Huff","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Billi Warmington","Good morning, everyone.","Mark Begor","Hey, Bill.","Billi Warmington","A question on the revenue pipeline. Last time when we talked, it was reaching a two-year high. I believe although you had mentioned it was heavily weighted towards the first and second stages of that pipeline. I just wanted to ask, how you would describe that pipeline in those terms today.","Mark Begor","Yes, Bill. I don\u2019t remember saying a two-year high, but I probably did or one of us did. But there\u2019s no question of pipeline build through the year last year and that continued in the fourth quarter. I think John talked about our execution on deals in the fourth quarter. I know you\u2019re referring to USIS I believe in this, in your comments, which is what we\u2019ll address and that\u2019s continuing in the first quarter. We just have active dialogs. We feel like we\u2019re back to kind of normal commercial discussions, the security discussions, we\u2019re not having really anymore with our customers. Although, our customers continue to want to learn from us about what we\u2019re doing, when you\u2019re investing the amounts we are in security and technology, we\u2019re putting cutting edge stuff in.","So there, we\u2019re doing a lot of best practice sharing which builds our relationship, our partnership with our customers. But as we continued in the first quarter, we see those pipelines continue to be quite strong; at the same time, we try to be clear on this call and prior calls that predicting the closure rate on those when you\u2019re still building pipelines versus a run rate pipeline that we had in September 2017 before the cybersecurity incident. And as you know, that kind of new deal pipeline in September 2017 went away and we\u2019ve been working hard to build that over the last 15, 16 months and continued positively, which is reflected in the guidance we tried to give for 2019 and how we see USIS progressing as it goes through the year. But again with that caution that this is hard to predict on when deals are actually going to close. So that\u2019s the one that we\u2019re not back to our normal ability as John mentioned a few minutes ago to really forecast how our yields are going to close inside USIS and that\u2019s still to come for us.","Billi Warmington","And then as a follow-up question on the work numbers. You highlighted the very strong records growth nearing 90 million. What do you see as a total opportunity there and then how much are the match rate actually improving as a result of the higher records?","Mark Begor","Yes. On the first half of your question, we just see a lot of opportunity. I use the term with you before and others on this call and I use it internally with Rudy and his team EWS. From my perspective, EWS is really in the second inning of their growth. And as you know, you own the business for a decade, a record growth in one of those. As you know, there\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the right number is, something around 150 million non-farm payroll or 90 million, we\u2019ve got a lot of growth opportunity to grow our records and we talked about how that record growth was accelerating In the fourth quarter and through the latter parts of the year from our technology investments, partnerships we have. So, we expect record growth to continue and with the top-end on that, it\u2019s hard to say. But we\u2019re energized about the opportunity going forward. The second half of your question on the match rate, I don\u2019t know John, what that is?","John Gamble","And quite honestly, given that the way we serve customers are so different by customer and by application, be difficult for me to give you an average. Just needless to say as Mark said, right, as the database grows, our ability to respond goes up and it\u2019s a significant benefit to us.","Mark Begor","And again, I mentioned a couple of times on this call, the beauty of this business is that we had in that record today and it\u2019s monetized tomorrow. That\u2019s kind of the great thing about the business when you\u2019ve got a lot of use cases, whether it\u2019s mortgage or government or ticket and your hit rates go up, that means your revenue goes up. So, it\u2019s quite an exciting workforce.","Billi Warmington","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee","Yes. Hi, good morning. On the Equifax 2020 initiatives, I guess, you said you won\u2019t add back any of the costs beyond 2020. But is it safe to say the vast majority of the investment and changes completed by the end of 2020? And as part of that, would it be reasonable to think that you begin to see some benefits during the next two years if this happens or should we really think that the benefits really accrue beyond 2020, both on the ability to deliver stuff quicker to the customers in your internal innovation and the cost side? Thank you.","John Gamble","We expect to make a lot of progress in the next couple of years, but in terms of the specific response to your question, we need to let some time pass. And yes, we do expect to see benefits as we move forward, right. We said we\u2019re going to see \u2013 we\u2019re going to see major changes move into the data fabric in 2019. That absolutely benefits us as we go into 2020, operationally, speed to market, a lot of different ways. So, we certainly do expect to see benefits. Financial benefits don\u2019t happen until you turn something off, right. Turning something on doesn\u2019t give you financial benefit, but turning it off does. So the turning it off part, so the financial benefit, that\u2019s a lot more starting in 2020.","Mark Begor","Gary, I think we also try to give some color this morning with actually \u2013 when some things are happening, we try to spice them out as you know things that were installed in the fourth quarter, things are happening in the first quarter. So that is going to provide benefits. It\u2019s not a switch that\u2019s going to be switched on at the end of 2020. This is going to happen all the way through this timeframe and beyond 2020. The benefits are going to accrue from these significant investments.","Gary Bisbee","Great. And then the follow-up. As both of you discussed the 2019 outlook and I appreciate all the commentary you provided. An awful lot of it sounds like it gets a lot better as the year goes on. I realize a bunch of that is comps and sort of market stuff around mortgage. But can you help us gauge your confidence just on the deliverability of what sounds like a much more back loaded and aggressive Q1 to Q4 ramp that you\u2019re talking about? Thank you.","John Gamble","We tried Gary to give you some color. I think you got to be the judge on that too, but we\u2019re trying to give some color on the significant part of the comps on this, meaning, the cost in the first quarter versus the ramp rate that we had last year, the mortgage headwinds that we start to comp out on as we get into the second half. So, there is a big element of that. And at the same time, we gave a range that we were intentional about for revenue and EPS, because there are some uncertainties out there that we wanted to make sure you understood.","At the same time, there\u2019s a number of our businesses, in particular, EWS that we have a lot of visibility and kind of clarity on, when you think about the headwinds in Australia for international and a lesser degree Argentina, and then the U.S. mortgage headwinds in United States, we try to \u2013 for USIS, we try to put a box around those of what we think is reasonable. But those have been proven to be hard to forecast for us in the last six to 12 months. And then you lay out the last factor on top of USIS, we think we\u2019ve got a good case here inside of the range that we provided, but we know that is less predictable today than it has been in the past.","Gary Bisbee","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. And we\u2019ll move on to our last question for today from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.","Nick Nikitas","Hey, guys. This is Nick Nikitas on for Jeff. Thanks for squeezing me in. So just coming back to the tech transformation timelines, really helpful detail and understandably, it sounds like there\u2019s a lot still going on. But just given it sounds like it will remain fairly intensive over the next 12 to 18 months. Can you just talk about how that\u2019s impacting the go-to-market opportunity? And Mark, you talked about multiple versions for an application. So is that in a dynamic that\u2019s still a somewhat material governor on new business or are we kind of past the peak point of headwinds and you\u2019re starting to see improvement there?","Mark Begor","Yes. From our perspective, Nick, I would and John you should jump in. We don\u2019t see the tech transformation impacting our ability to grow. It\u2019s really going to be a positive going forward and we got focused and dedicated technology teams. We\u2019ve ramped up a lot more resources there. So, this is focused, the teams that are working on it are working on it. Our commercial teams are just doing what they should do every day, out there selling. Now, they\u2019ll have a role when we get ready to use the migrations of working with our technology team, with our customers, technology team and their counterparts inside of our customers, but I don\u2019t see this having an impact on impeding growth in anyway.","And the other element is, when we talk to customers, you think about, if you\u2019re going to be partnering with someone, who is going to make this kind of investment in their infrastructure, we\u2019re doing it for our customers. So, it becomes a very positive dialog about the partnership with our customers. They\u2019re quite positive about what we\u2019re doing on technology, what we\u2019re doing on data analytics, the ability for them to more easily access the data, this becomes an easier commercial discussion about doing things this week and next week, because of the kind of partner we\u2019re going to be long-term for them when we complete elements in this EFX 2020 transformation.","John Gamble","And as we said in the past, right, I mean, the thing that we \u2013 that we just have to keep in mind and focus on is the fact that when you add this much additional activity, right, it does create more complexity. So, as Mark said, we\u2019re focused on making sure that it doesn\u2019t impede the way we\u2019re able to deliver, but it\u2019s also a significant challenge for our team that they have to stay very focused on, because when you\u2019re going through a transformation and adding this much resource to try to do it at pace that it absolutely will impact your \u2013 it does create more complexity in your processes and just something we have to work through.","Nick Nikitas","Okay. That makes sense. And just a quick one on the mortgage. I think, Mark, you mentioned some shift in the reseller end market. Can you just talk about what that was and if it\u2019s incorporated to the end-market forecast you guys outlined or I guess it will be slightly incremental?","Mark Begor","Yes. That\u2019s just \u2013 in our business, we used go-to-market in two different ways in mortgage. We have mortgage solutions, where we actually sell the tri-merge report, we take our reports, combine it with our competitors and sell the report or \u2013 and\/or we simply sell our report to somebody, who does that combination so, to a reseller. And we are just talking about that we see \u2013 we have seen shifts \u2013 channel shifts in and out of our core mortgage business as we move through the year. And as we get into 2019, we\u2019re probably going to see continued channel shifts. We would expect probably away from us in core mortgage in the first half.","Nick Nikitas","Okay. But all of that\u2019s included in kind of the end market forecast of\u2026","Mark Begor","It is, it is absolutely, because that doesn\u2019t change the number of inquiries. It just changes what we deliver, yes.","Nick Nikitas","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Mark Begor","Great. Thank you very much.","John Gamble","Thanks everybody.","Trevor Burns","Thanks everybody.","Operator","And this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you for your participation.

Just a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge with Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.","During this -- today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2012 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will also refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax. Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and associated tax effects. This measure is detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation table included with our earnings release and also posted on our website.","Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab on our website for further details.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.","Third quarter was a really strong broad-based performance and largely came in as we had guided, not only early in the year, but then reconfirmed in our last call for the second quarter. The third quarter performance was driven by a continued accelerated growth in our core non-mortgage products, along with solid execution on our strategic initiatives around the company, that offsetting mortgage market decline of over 34% for the quarter.","Revenue -- total revenue for the quarter was $572 million, up 10% from the third quarter 2012. Operating margin was an impressive 27.6%, up significantly from 25.1% a year ago. And adjusted EPS was $0.90, up 21% from 74%(sic)[$0.74] last year.","Year-to-date, total revenue was $1.7 billion, up 12%; and adjusted EPS, $2.69, up 25%. An important metric that we talk to you about routinely and something we focus on intensely here is the organic growth rate of our core non-mortgage market activities and the continued execution of strategic initiatives in our mortgage business -- across the company. The progress we are making on broadening and diversifying our revenue growth is critical to successfully delivering our long-term business model.","In the third quarter, the organic revenue growth in core non-mortgage market activities accelerated beyond the long-term range we have of 6% to 8%, to 9%, so a good execution across the business there.","As I always do, let me briefly cover a few key highlights from each of our business units. Starting with USCIS, they continue to leverage the Equifax's extensive data assets, analytical resources and technology capabilities to broaden and deepen our customer relationships and to deliver solid double-digit growth in the quarter. USCIS has made great progress with its enterprise selling initiatives, which we've talked about routinely. And this has generated incremental core revenue growth for not only USCIS, but also for Workforce Solutions and our North American Commercial business. For example, in the quarter, we increased our revenue potential with a large bank by leveraging the full range of Workforce Solutions verifications offerings. This new contract represents a 15% increase in revenue over the life of the contract.","You heard us talk about our KCP program, key client program, which started off with 4 of the largest banks in the U.S. That team, they have great leaders, they've executed extremely well. They've got great talent across that organization, and they've done a great job with our KCP clients. As a result of their success, we continue to add accounts to their responsibility. We've recently added 2 large telco customers that has integrated go-to-market strategy, along with 2 large credit card companies added earlier this year. We now have a total of 8 critical customers under the leadership of KCP. That model continues to bode well for us in the U.S.","A couple more points on USCIS, they have worked very hard throughout the year to drive strong organic growth in its core non-mortgage activities. The rate of growth for these products and services increased each quarter this year. And we expect that rate to increase again in the fourth quarter, exiting 2013 at the highest level for the year.","Total mortgage market originations in the fourth quarter are expected to be down on somewhere between 40% and 50% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. This is consistent with our original expectations for the second half of the year. So mortgage markets performing largely as we expected when we gave guidance back in December.","As a result, we expect USCIS, their reported revenue for the fourth quarter to be between 11% and 13% growth, which is consistent with the second half guidance we gave in our second quarter release.","Let me move on to International. International delivered a solid double-digit constant-currency growth rate and expanded its operating margin by focusing their energy on those initiatives where they're best positioned to win in all geographies around the world. Year-to-date, International's new product revenue from products launched in the prior 3 years reached a 14% level of total revenues. And they are on the path to exceed that target -- their target for the full year. So great execution by Paulino and his team around NPI.","Also on International, our Personal Solutions product lines are delivering strong double-digit growth in the U.K. through market penetration and new products. It's a theme you've heard us talk about for the last year, that continues. And our high-value solutions in Technology and Analytical Services continue to deliver solid double-digit growth rates across the International footprint. For the quarter, we expect International's constant-currency revenue growth to be between 9% and 11%, again, very consistent with the guidance we gave during our second quarter release.","Onto Workforce Solutions. They have successfully broadened each reach for both employment and income verification services to new end-user segments. As a result, their core organic growth in the non-mortgage market has accelerated in 2013. And they expect to exit the year with double-digit growth in our non-mortgage market initiatives. Just a great execution there by Dann and his team as well.","A couple of key points. Through the development of unique solutions for some of our traditional-served markets, the average revenue per active record in 2013 is expected to be almost double the amount it was back in 2007, when we completed the acquisition. That's a series of better segmentation, bundling of products, strategic pricing initiatives and NPI. Good job there.","We also continue to add new records to the premier database of the employment and income information, known as The Work Number. By the end of this year, we expect to have over 230 million records, an all-time high, in The Work Number database, which is well on our way to reaching our current target of 250 million records we've talked about a few quarters ago. We now have over 3,000 companies reporting our information into The Work Number database, also a new record.","For the fourth quarter, we expect Workforce Solutions revenue growth to be flat or slightly down, reflecting the continuation of strong growth in the non-mortgage market, offset by the impact of the lower mortgage market activity, which we discussed earlier under USCIS. A good performance in the fourth quarter as well.","I want to make a quick update on the employment income verification project with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. You've read about this. You've seen it. We have stood up our income verification platform on time. We've successfully performed and automated verification processes without any problems. But unfortunately, there are a number of glitches within the system itself. You may have read the article even this morning in The Wall Street Journal. They're going to continue. We should continue to expect hiccups in the launch of the Affordable Care Act for quite some time. The good news is we've told each of you, we have expected very little income or revenue from that this year. But we stand ready to perform as soon as they get this resolved, and we're convinced they will get it resolved, it's just a matter of time.","Onto Personal Solutions. They delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter and they are working on successful integration of this acquisition of TrustedID earlier this year. We expect Personal Solutions growth in the fourth quarter to be between 8% and 11%, again, very consistent with the guidance that we gave you during the second quarter earnings call.","Last business unit, North America Commercial Solutions. They continue to perform well. Year-to-date, they have delivered double-digit growth rates through high-value services and market share gains, and are on a path to deliver fourth quarter growth between 5% and 8%. As we look forward, we continue to expect North America Commercial Solutions to deliver growth in the long-term range of 6% to 10%.","Let me go back to a few corporate themes that I think are important, too, before I turn it over to Lee to give you some details on the financials. The investments we've made in our new product initiatives and strategic acquisitions continue to provide solid returns as we further diversify across our served markets and broaden our solution offerings. From double-digit growth in Workforce Solutions new end-user markets, to double-digit growth in our analytics and decision technology offerings in International, to the strength of our enterprise selling initiatives across USCIS, to the steady above-market growth in Personal Solutions and Commercial Solutions, we continue to identify opportunities for investments across each of our core operating units. We're also finding great opportunities for strategic acquisitions.","As I mentioned earlier this quarter, we closed on our acquisition of TrustedID for PSol. We currently have a robust pipeline of opportunities, which have the potential to strengthen our competitive position and broaden our product offerings.","The leadership team has done an outstanding job of executing on the strategic growth initiatives and operating objectives this year, enabling us to successfully mitigate the impact of the mortgage headwinds that we expected. And they began in the third quarter of this year. We expect those headwinds to continue, by the way, through the first half of 2014 and improve in the second half of 2014. The acceleration of our core organic non-mortgage market growth rates throughout 2013 positions us well for the fourth quarter and for 2014. I'll talk more about that after Lee goes through his numbers.","As we look forward, the path the we're on to be the global leader in information solutions by creating unparalleled insights with data that requires, we continuously improve our critical, strategic capabilities. New product innovation and analytics are 2 very important competencies where we are making ongoing investments to improve our processes and enhance our domain expertise. To me[ph] , our competitive edge requires that we continually adapt and transform these capabilities. These will continue to be areas of focus and investment for us going forward.","In the new product innovation area, we continually focus on driving bigger and better ideas, as well as improving our speed to market, so time to revenue. We've made great progress so far, but the world doesn't stand still, so we still have to continue to invest and improve those processes. You'll here more about that in 2014.","The quality of our data and analytics expertise will enable us to support key solutions for our core business initiatives, but will also serve to diversify our served markets and broaden our decisioning opportunities, where any and all information can be used. Because of our vast array of data assets, the skill in drawing out relevant insights for our customers increasingly look for us -- for thought leadership and how to improve their decisioning activities and operating effectiveness. The journey we're on continues to provide great opportunities for growth and for us to leverage our data assets, our capabilities and expertise to solve problems for our customers in the future that we could not solve in the past.","Now, I'll turn over to Lee for details on the financials.","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.","This morning, I will be referring to the financial results from continuing operations, generally presented on a GAAP basis. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.","Our third quarter performance is solid and broad-based. It's also very consistent with what we anticipated when we gave our full year guidance in July. Let me turn to the quarterly results. Compared to the same quarter in 2012, in the third quarter of 2013, consolidated revenue of $572 million was up 10% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant-currency basis. Operating margin was 27.6%, up 250 basis points from last year, driven primarily by operating margin expansion in USCIS, Workforce Solutions and our International business.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.71, up 14% from the same quarter next(sic)[last] year. And excluding acquisition-related amortization and associated tax effects, adjusted EPS was $0.90 a share, up $0.16 or 21% when compared to the third quarter of 2012.","Moving to the individual business units. Our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $253 million, up 15%. The acquisition of CSC, which we refer to as our Central Region, contributed 14% growth. And our core non-mortgage market organic growth, including strategic initiatives, contributed approximately 6% to growth, while the decline in mortgage market volumes subtracted 5% from growth.","Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $184 million, up 14%. Excluding the Central Region, revenue was flat, as a decline due to lower mortgage market activity was offset by new products, market penetration and pricing initiatives.","Mortgage Solutions revenue of $28 million was up 15% compared to the third quarter of 2012, driven entirely by the acquisition of our Central Region. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was down 34% in the third quarter.","Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $41 million, up 23%. Organic growth was approximately 11%. The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 40.9%, which was up from 40.1% in the third quarter of 2012.","Our International business units revenue was $129 million, up 6% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant-currency basis. By region, Latin America's revenue was $49 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency, led by strong growth in Marketing Services and continued good growth in Analytical and Technology Services. Europe's revenue was $47 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currency. Good growth in financial institutions and the insurance sectors, in addition to continuing strong double-digit growth in Personal Solutions, more than offset softness in Marketing Services and Technology Services.","Canada Consumer information revenue was $33 million, up 1% in U.S. dollars and up 5% in local currency, driven primarily by Consumer Information Solutions and fraud solutions.","Our International operating margin was 30% compared to 27.4% in 2012, as all 3 geographic regions contributed to expanding margins.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $115 million for the quarter, up 3%. Verification Services, with revenue of $69 million, was flat when compared to the same quarter of 2012. Double-digit growth in auto, preemployment and government sectors offset a 12% decline in mortgage-related revenues.","Employer Services revenue was $46 million, up 8% compared to last year. And Workforce Solutions overall operating margin was 29.9% compared to 25.4% in Q3 of 2012, driven by reduced acquisition amortization and improved operating efficiencies. Our North America Personal Solutions revenue was $52 million, up 14% from a year ago. Double-digit growth in our U.S.-based subscription revenue in Canada and the acquisition of TrustedID were the key drivers of this performance.","Operating margin was 26.3% compared to 28.4% in the third quarter of 2012, impacted particularly by the acquisition-related amortization and investment from our acquisition of TrustedID.","North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $23 million, up 9% on a reported basis and up 10% on local-currency basis, driven largely by strong double-digit growth in our U.S. risk and marketing data services business segments. The operating margin was 17.5% compared to 18.8% in the year ago quarter as we continue our investments in North America Commercial's strategic growth initiatives.","One other miscellaneous issue I'll comment on is we normally file our 10-Q within a day or so of our earnings release. We received a comment letter from the SEC regarding our accounting for goodwill and intangibles in the CSC acquisition. We don't believe any changes will be material to our GAAP financials, and any changes would be noncash and not affect our adjusted EPS, but we are seeking to complete this issue before filing our 10-Q and that may modestly delay our 10-Q filing.","And with that, I'll turn this back over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Lee. Again, the third quarter performance, I think, is a great example of how our preparation for the ultimate mortgage headwinds enabled us to continue to deliver on our commitments we made to our shareholders. Team is very focused on execution. They have the energy and discipline to commitments to both customers and shareholders. The total mortgage market activity in the third quarter was what we'd anticipated and the fourth quarter mortgage market shaping up almost exactly as we had expected. I'll give you some framework for the full year in a second.","In spite of mortgage headwinds, we expect total Equifax organic growth in the core non-mortgage market activities in the fourth quarter to again exceed the top end of our long end organic growth range, which was 6% to 8%.","As a result, and assuming current exchange rates and the anticipated decline in mortgage, we anticipate revenue in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 7% to 8%, which is right in line with the full year growth, around the middle of the 10% to 12% annual range that we gave you during our second quarter conference call. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be between $0.89 and $0.92, which is again consistent with the full year adjusted EPS guidance we gave during our last release.","The full year operating margin is expected to be at the top end of the 26%, 27% range, as incremental margins from our core non-mortgage initiatives effectively offset any impact in the decline in the mortgage-related revenue.","Here's how I shape up the year, and I want to give you some framework for some points on how I think about the 2014 year. I'd say the first half of the year, the mortgage market was slightly stronger than anticipated. Second half of the year, the mortgage market was slightly weaker than expected. And the good news is our core organic non-growth initiatives accelerated throughout the year, enabling us to finish the year almost right on the original expectation.","So I'd like to provide just a very high level framework for how I think about 2014, and I'm going to do that through 5 individual points that I might -- think may help you as you think about Equifax next year. Point #1, we exit 2013 with a broad-based execution from all business units. It's as broad based, as strong and consistent a performance as we've seen in quite some time from all the different BUs.","Number 2, core organic non-mortgage market growth accelerated throughout the year, and that positions us well for 2014. I remain very comfortable in our ability to deliver that organic growth rate in a range of the model we've committed to you, 6% to 8%.","Number 3, our M&A pipeline for small to midsized acquisitions is very strong and should add to both our topline and bottom-line performance next year.","Number 4, we're anticipating an improving global economy in 2014. And we've talked a lot of the comments, including our own. And the assumption we're making is 2013 -- or '14 will, in fact, be modestly better than this year. And that should put us some winds at our back for the first time in some time.","Number 5, mortgage early reads from Fannie and Freddie are calling for the market to be stronger in the second half than in the first half, also calling for the market to be off somewhere in the mid 20s, 23% to 24% or 25%. And that early read is a decline that is less than we initially anticipated as we looked at 2014. Again, we'll have greater clarity on those points and more when we get together for our earnings call for the fourth quarter.","So with that, operator, I'd like to open it up to any questions our callers might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Rick, did I hear you correctly in your key points for 2014, that you thought you would be in the 6% to 8% organic revenue growth range for next year?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, David. What I was trying to say there is that we -- the team continues to accelerate the performance, execute at high levels. We're ending this year on a high note, with 2 quarters in a row beyond the high end of our 6% to 8% range. And that gives me confidence that we'll be in that range for next year of 6% to 8%, yes.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful, particularly given the mortgage activity. Lee, just shifting gears. Usually, you provide some very good perspective on the underlying drivers of OLCIS and USCIS in terms of just units and price. Could you walk us through some of the units and pricing trends you saw in both segments? And if you could drill down a little bit and give us a feel for unit growth in, let's say, credit card and auto, in addition to mortgage, that would be very helpful.","Lee Adrean","I don't think we typically break our transaction debt -- growth down by the individual submarkets. But our total volume growth in online credit reporting was down 2% for the quarter, and average revenue per transaction was up 1%. What was the other? Was there another line of business besides online that you asked about?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Well, for USCIS, as a whole, can you give us some perspective on volumes versus price?","Lee Adrean","Well that's -- yes, when we talk about USCIS, we are typically focused on our online business, where we have a relatively homogeneous source of revenue, it being predominantly credit reporting. The down 2%, by the way, compares -- is about the same as the last quarter, which was also down 2%. And the revenue performance with mortgage volume falling off, which tends to be attractively priced, the improvement in revenue per transaction was only -- was plus 1%. It had been running at higher levels due to the mortgage mix in prior quarters.","Richard F. Smith","David, you asked the question, too, about a couple of the verticals. One was auto, and I think maybe credit card and something else. But the auto market in USCIS continues to perform well, and part of it's the market itself. Part of it is, I think, we've discussed earlier this year, the creation of a new vertical focused on auto with a new team leader, new products and so on and so forth, new partners. That continues to perform well in USCIS. Number 2, 2 other markets that are performing well throughout the year, including third quarter, is the insurance vertical, which you know has been a focus for us for couple of years now, and third is retail revenue.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just coming back to your comments on the margin expansion at Workforce Solutions. Of the 450 basis points, how much was a decline in purchase price amortization versus an improvement in operating efficiencies? Just trying to size the margin trends in that business going forward as the benefit from lower amortization rolls off.","Lee Adrean","The majority came from the reduced acquisition amortization, and that's at the full rate that we're going to see for the next couple of years now. So you won't see any further change in the effective acquisition amortization. On top of that, obviously, operating efficiencies were an addition to that, and also by the way, helped offset with mortgage volume declining, total Workforce Solutions volume flat. That naturally, if anything, would have created a little bit of drag on margins and we were able to offset that.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just final question. You highlighted some acquisition opportunities, particularly small- to mid-sized businesses. Any particular vertical industries you want to highlight where you're focused from an M&A perspective?","Richard F. Smith","No, it's really tied back to our strategy. It's not going to be anything where we'll catch anyone offguard. It's adding some capabilities we need. It's adding some additional footprint expansion that we need, some tuck-in on current capabilities, so it's pretty broad-based and consistent with our strategy. And in fact, as I look at it, David, every business unit has opportunities that we've identified. As you know, we just finished our 3-year strategic plan back in September. So the M&A pipeline seems right off of that, so it looks good.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Andrew. It sounds like the mortgage revenues at Equifax have performed way better than the market. You referred to the MBA index being down 34% in the third quarter. So Equifax's 3 practices has kind of widened the gap from the market. Do you anticipate that happening and why? I mean continuing to happen and why?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, Andrew. Something we've been focused on now across the company, and the mortgage vertical is 1 benefactor of that, and that is finding ways to innovate at high rates, finding ways to bring new products to market at high rates, finding ways to bundle products together that no one else has, so we can get more spend in the marketplace, and trying to find ways to take share. So mortgage is a subset of that overall strategy. They performed well versus the banking index now for a number of years. So yes, I completely expect our performance to be above the market. So when the market's up, I expect it to grow at a faster rate than the mortgage market. And when it's down, I expect it to decline at a slower rate, so yes.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And you agree that Equifax's outperformance in that segment increased in the third quarter, right?","Richard F. Smith","Clearly.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First, could you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape for some of your products that serve the B2B lending landscape, like commercial credit scores, business failure scores, et cetera? Are you seeing any share gains? Talk a little bit about pricing or any impact you're seeing from some new competition from Dun & Bradstreet and others?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. If you're referring predominantly to the U.S., which it sounds like you are, we've got great competitors in the U.S. marketplace and good competitors around the world. We respect what D&B's doing, we respect what Experian is doing. But what we focus on here is our strategy, our NPI, our share gains. And in U.S., we were such a small player. The team is doing a good job of growing through NPI and through share gains. As I've said before multiple times, share gains, long term, is a tough proposition. What you're better off doing is finding ways to build products and solve problems that no one else can solve, so the spend goes up and you get that incremental spend. And that is definitely what our North America Commercial Solutions business is doing. Yes, because they're small, they're also gaining share.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I think you've also talked in the past about a push to sales from additional Verification Services to various verticals that provide consumer loans where your penetration is low. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the penetration of employment versus income verification. I'd say the auto dealers versus credit card companies, student loans, mortgage, et cetera. Just a little bit of color on the different vertical penetration?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. I usually give you some details on the different verticals. I don't think I have that off my head today. But that's a huge part of Dann's -- if you think of The Work Number strategy, it centers on a couple of things. Number 1 is rapidly growing -- I mean 3 things, rapidly growing the database, which that team has done a marvelous job of doing, going from something like 180 million records to 230 million records. Number 2 is finding a way to get more value out of each record you have, which they've done. I mentioned that the value for records almost doubled what it was back in 2007. Number 3 then is -- to your point, is to deploy new resources and leverage -- redeploy those resources so that we would call enterprise selling to take the income employment verifications to markets we never thought about before, like government, insurance, auto and card. As I mentioned in my opening comments, that's really been a driver of Dann's growth outside the mortgage market. So as the mortgage market declines, he's getting great performance there. And we're at the early days of that performance in my view, too. I clearly see a path of 250 million records. I see more value in each record, and I see us selling more and more to non-mortgage markets. The last thing to talk about with EWS is they're getting great traction around an acquisition we had a couple of years ago called, eThority, which is bringing analytics to Dann's customer base that we never could do before. And that will be a stream of revenue growth going forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First, just a question around the M&A. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like the pipeline of -- at least the way you sounded, was a lot better than maybe it has been. So does that imply that maybe the pace of acquisitions relative to what you guys have done might speed up in '14? That's just the first part. And let me just -- I'll ask the next one. Just in terms of -- you said small to medium size. Just curious on what the thoughts, plans were around the larger acquisitions, because you guys have obviously done well with the 2 major ones you've done. Just thoughts around that.","Richard F. Smith","Great, thank you. No, I still think our long-term financial model is largely going to be driven around organic growth initiatives. That is the things we know how to do. We do them very well. We've been at them now for 8 years, and it's lower risk. Having said that, we also have always talked about 1, 2 points, some years higher than that, some years a little less, coming from M&A. So over the long-term model, I think you should still think about us being in that range. It doesn't mean, to your second point, that we'll shy away from the large deals. We have done very well, to your point, with the TALX acquisition back in -- almost 7 years ago, and with CSC 9, 10 months ago. But those are naturally -- obviously, have higher risk and higher price tags. So we always keep an eye on those from time to time. What I do is I'm a firm believer that those have got to be paced at a very slow rate, so you can fully digest, integrate and succeed with the large acquisitions, where you have the ability to maybe have a little faster cadence with the smaller to mid-sized deals.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then so I guess with that in context, just obviously, you guys did back into the buyback market, share buybacks this quarter. You're down to that leverage range you guys have historically wanted to be. So going forward, obviously, unless you guys are involved in some M&A's that using the cash, should we continue to expect the buybacks to be implemented?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. I'd say, strategically, the philosophy that Lee and I have of using our cash first for organic growth initiatives remains, two is we remain committed to our dividend policy that we implemented a couple of years ago. Third, as I just mentioned to you, Manav, M&A will be an important part of our long-term growth strategy. And we remain committed to buying back shares, and it will ebb and flow. As you said, we've delevered from over 2x EBITDA in the first quarter to around 1.6x. We'll look at what comes up on the M&A side and balance that off with share repurchases.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rick, I know it's probably difficult, but I think if you looked at the previous announcement on the CMS contract, it would have implied roughly $65 million a year. With the sort of maybe slower start of the healthcare exchanges, can you talk about what you're thinking about for 2014 from that contract?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, and that's a great question. We will plan for a very -- financially plan for a very modest amount of revenue at this time because of all the issues they're having. I remain very, very hopeful that this thing will, in fact, materialize at a level that makes a material impact to us, be it the $65 million range that you just calculated yourself, Paul, or something around that. We'll know a lot more, as I said when we were on the call together back in the second quarter, come February. I'm hopeful the budgets the administration is working through now are largely ironed out. The math is straightforward math. And sometime we can all walk through that, but how you get that $65 million is pretty straightforward math. It's just a matter of them getting the system up and running. So as I mentioned earlier, we have contemplated very little revenues this year. At this juncture, I think it's prudent for us to assume modest revenues next year. And if things are up and running and humming come February, we'll have 4, 5 months of experience under our belts. And we'll have much better transparency to what that might look like in 2014.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just on the government shutdown, I know you do some work within Workforce Solutions around E-Verify and I-9. Is that just delayed revenue within the quarter, or does that have an impact for the entire quarter, for the fourth quarter?","Richard F. Smith","It's a good question, Paul. It's so small. It was just not on E-Verify and I-9, there was obviously the mortgage market. You pull a 4506-T if you can't find an instant verification on The Work Number. That slowed down. It's hard to discern specifically and quantify how much of that was a drag versus some of your catch-up in the following weeks, but there's no doubt we did feel some slowdown in EWS as a result of the government shutdown. But I would not categorize it as being dramatic.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Before I get greedy and ask this question, I want to recognize that 2 quarters ago, people were saying how are you going to get up to 6% to 8% when you're trending at 4.5% core growth. So hats off to the team in terms of what you've done the last 2 quarters. But now I'll get greedy with my question. Why is 6% to 8% the right number? And I ask it from the standpoint, you're clearly trending above that now in what I'll call, for a lack of a better term, kind of a blah economy. So if the economy gets better, why is 6% to 8% the right number? Is there anything that is going on right now that you view as unsustainable? I'll leave it there.","Richard F. Smith","It is awfully greedy, Jeff, thank you. Thank you for the backhanded compliments, too, I appreciate that. I'd say when we framed up the long-term financial model, it was contemplating multiple cycles. Some cycles, when you have a downturn in the economy, other cycles, when you have an upturn. Obviously, when you have an upturn in the economy, you should expect to be at the upper end of that range. And when you have a downturn, maybe at the lower end of that range. So the view is that is a sustainable model for you to think about Equifax long term. Secondly, there's a lot of thought that went into this 6% to 8%. It's just not a number we pull out of the hat. It is taking a look at things we're doing around NPI. What's our success rate, how many products do we launch every year, what's the time to revenue from your launch, what's the success rate of the launch, bundling, segmentation, strategic pricing. This is a very systematic model that we build across multiple initiatives, across every BU in every country, that gets to that 6% to 8% range. And we feel that's a pretty good range.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then understand that you guys have been offsetting it with expansion in the core. But how should we think about the incremental margins for all of your mortgage business across the 3 buckets?","Lee Adrean","The incremental margin, it's a mix of some very high margin business, additional credit reports, additional instant verifications, along with some services that have higher pass-through costs. When you put those 2 together incrementally, we're probably looking at incremental margins that are in the 40% to 50% range. So with mortgage dropping, we've got to work extra hard to try to offset that from a margin perspective.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And will you -- do you think you'll continue to be able to offset that in the first half of 2014?","Lee Adrean","Yes. I think we're looking for kind of probably comparable margins in 2014 and 2013.","Richard F. Smith","Jeff, here's how Lee and I think about margins. We gave you a framework of trying to deliver 25 basis points of margin improvement every year. And then this year, we gave you a range, I think it was 26% to 27%. And we delivered or delivering at the very high end of that range. So I still think over -- I think of 27%-ish as being a good foundation for us. And then over multiple years, getting back to the 25-basis-points improvement year in, year out.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up question to Andrew's on mortgage. Understand that you guys have a long-term track record of outperforming the broader market. But is the magnitude of the outperformance at all sustainable? Or why the big step-up in Q3 to be flat organically in a 34% down market? That's obviously a huge gap.","Richard F. Smith","Again, I'd say it's nothing -- no 1 single -- single silver bullet, it comes down to multiple things. It is new products. It is bundling of existing products with new products to get more share of wallet and share gain. It is strategic pricing initiatives. And the combination of all 3 or 4 of those things has continued to pay dividends for us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just want to ask a little bit, you're doing a great job -- I'm just going to beat this horse one more time, by the way -- on offsetting the mortgage headwinds. And one thing I was just thinking about is just the Mortgage Solutions business is probably like the most levered to mortgage. And you offset the mortgage headwinds the most in that area. And verification has got relatively less compared to mortgage. And you had -- the implication is that there was not the same kind of offset because you kept them both flat. Were there particular initiatives, specifically in mortgage, that were -- it was more of a focus for you guys than there were in Verification Services? I'm just trying to get a little bit of color around that.","Richard F. Smith","No, I'd say the USCIS Mortgage Solutions business has had a longer period of time to build new products to allow them to offset the decline in mortgage. Dann has been at this diversification into -- someone else asked a second ago -- auto insurance, government, collections, card. And Dann's been out there may be 2.5 years or so, and he's just building that momentum now. So they're doing a great job. I don't ever want to underestimate that, but he is newer to the game at diversifying the revenue streams, building out the analytics capability, which is what gives me so much confidence that as time goes on, our ability to continue to grow regardless of mortgage cycles is enhanced. The longer we get Dann's team at this diversification model, the better off we're going to be.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's good color on that. One other thing, just in the healthcare market. I know they've got that big CMS contract, which should hopefully be very nice for you guys in the coming years. But there's a global just kind of a trend that it is going to force -- and we're seeing this right now -- just more higher deductible healthcare plans. And that's going to force basically doctors, hospitals, everyone, to try to collect from consumers or set up their billing with consumers and analyze it more upfront. I was just wondering, do you have particular initiatives in that area in order to kind of capitalize on this trend? Because I know some of the other competitors out there are focusing on that right now.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, we continue to look that. We're bringing consultants in. We looked at M&A opportunities. There may be opportunities. It's not glaring to me, Shlomo, right now on what those opportunities are. I think our plate is so full. If we can execute the CMS contract fully, and when I say fully, it is not just the sort of bite of the apple, which is the contract that's been alluded to now for a few quarters, but it's the follow-on effects that CMS will be looking for. It is then going to IRS and other arms of the government who need verification --- actual instant verification of income and employment for many, many social services that are offered. I think if we focus our efforts there on providing unique value, we -- you, our investors, and our customers, and ourselves will be nicely rewarded.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just one follow-up on that. Just right now, your contract is for the automatic Verification Services, you guys also do the manual Verification Services. Do you see that contract eventually being expanded to that over time because there's the same need?","Richard F. Smith","That was the multiple bite to the apple I was referring to. I think, first and foremost, [indiscernible] CMS is so alone[ph] getting the system stood up and the contractors ready. All of their energy is there, but we have made the offer. We do multiple things, so they're very interested. We're one of the few vendors who actually stood up our capabilities on time, on budget, so on and so forth, so we've got enormous credibility with them right now. We stand ready to do more as soon as they're ready.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It's actually -- it's Matt Roswell in for Dan. Two questions. First on the margins for next year, could you talk about how even -- how you get to flat, given the headwinds from the mortgage business and the loss of incremental margin there, the sort of grow over of the CFC accretion? I'm just trying to get a feel for how you get that margin growth or flat margin, I should say.","Richard F. Smith","Lee, why don't you take that one?","Lee Adrean","Yes. Of course, the accretion on margin from CSC will maintain itself. It doesn't expand again, but it will -- that will maintain itself. The mortgage pressures, we will be working to offset that through growing some of our other lines of business. And then continuing -- we had a continuing lien effort across the company to drive efficiencies year in, year out, and that also gives us some benefit. So as I said, next year's margins may more likely be flattish to this year's rather than typical, but of course, that's following a year where we had great expansion. But we do think there are enough levers that we can likely offset the pressure we'll see on mortgage, particularly in the first half of the year, where we're going to be facing the most challenging comparables on mortgage in 2014.","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my second question is, are you seeing sort of more activity down in the lower-credit-quality consumer? And I don't want to say subprime yet, but are you starting to see that come back or...","Richard F. Smith","Yes, yes. I think, Matt, you're seeing that the banks get a little more aggressive, especially in the auto market. They're being aggressive. It's not anywhere close to what the credit quality may have been back in 2005, '06, '07. But yes, the banks are being a little more aggressive.","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And is that part of the reason...","Lee Adrean","Matt, to your question of being a little cautious about what the bank behavior might be, while we do see them getting to subprime, it's interesting because is that it is very careful, very structured. It's the upper tiers of sub prime. We're not seeing the indiscriminate behavior of 2005, '06 and '07. So we think it appears healthy from everything we can observe, both on the tiers they're getting into, as well as the early-stage delinquency remaining well under control. So it is -- from what we can see, it's being done prudently, but it is happening.","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I could sneak in a third one in there. The strength on the consumer financial marketing, the old credit marketing business. Can you talk about what the driver to that was?","Lee Adrean","The biggest driver in that is we've talked some in the past about our IXI business having some downdraft as certain uses of the product were cut back on. We're now seeing IXI return to growth. So by comparison, that's where the acceleration is. The underlying traditional credit marketing is running kind of comparable to the last couple of quarters, and it's really the acceleration back to growth of IXI.","Richard F. Smith","In fact, IXI, Matt, that was the strongest quarterly growth we've had in a long time.","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Since you mentioned IXI, I'm surprised no one's asked about the regulatory environment. Any thoughts, changes, et cetera?","Richard F. Smith","I think it's a correlation to what Lee just said. The fact that we're growing, we work very closely with our customers. And it wasn't regulatory, it was uncertainty around regulation that drove some concern. And working very closely with the customers, understanding their interpretation of the concern and then modifying our product offering accordingly, while still adding value, has enabled us to return to growth.","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And what about in terms of the broader business, the CFPB, all that fun stuff?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, that is fun. CFPB, we continue to stay very close to them. There's no real changes since the last time we discussed. They continue to visit. But as far as impact to the business, expense to the business, impact on product offerings, it remains as we've discussed before. Very manageable at this point in time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I had to jump on late, so I apologize if I'm repetitive, Rick and Lee. With regard to -- I just want to clarify a little bit on the margin discussion. With regard to margin, I know historically, Equifax has referred to EBIT, but now some of the intangibles amortization is rolling off. Is it more appropriate to be looking at your EBITDA margin going forward as the right measure of profitability?","Richard F. Smith","No, that's a great, great question, Andrew. We would -- always thought that operating margin -- Lee and I do, obviously, routinely look at cash margin and EBITDA margin, how that performs versus operating margin. So you don't become complacent with operating margin growth because of the amortization. So we do look at it. We thought about do we start using that metric is a means of communicating to our investors and the sell side guys. And we'll kick that around. We may, in fact, do that.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So when you're thinking about flat margin for '14, that's EBIT?","Lee Adrean","Yes.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Which implies probably a down EBITDA margin?","Lee Adrean","No, I'm not sure that's right. I'm not sure. At least at the moment, I don't think there's a lot of difference in the acquisition amortization this year and next year, maybe just a slight amount just because revenue's growing, but ...","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Lee Adrean","I don't see a big difference in those 2 trends in 2014.","Richard F. Smith","And Andrew, here's what we could do. Let me now kick this around. If we think there's merit in discussing it, we can come back at the February earnings call.","Lee Adrean","Well, our D&A's very public. It's in our release.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right, right. Okay. And then Rick, with regard to the 9% non-mortgage core organic revenue growth, can you opine a little bit or expand, I guess, on new end markets, and maybe you did that. That's why I apologize if I'm asking you to repeat yourself. But were there some particular call-outs in terms of end markets or customers that drove that above-trend performance?","Richard F. Smith","No, that's right. No, it was -- as I mentioned in my early comments, which you unfortunately couldn't hear, it was really broad-based. It was all 5 BUs -- 6 BUs. It was all countries and it's driven by the same things that you've seen us talk about, which is new products, bundling of products, segmentation, pricing, all the things we've been doing now for 8 years really starting to jump.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, could you give us an update on Russia and whether or not that's a business that potentially becomes wholly owned by Equifax at some point?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. From a market perspective, and you and I were together recently, it continues to perform extremely well. We are in a very good #1 position in the marketplace. We are adding contributors of data at records paces. We were adding users of data at record paces. We're growing top line, bottom line. We're innovating. We're leveraging now more fully. We'll do so even more next year. All the capabilities we have in our International arena for Paulino Barros to bring more products and platforms to Russia. And we're diligently working with our partners there to see if there's a path for us to take a bigger role and consolidate Russia. We like the business, and the team has done a heck of a job over the last 5 or 6 years at running it.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And would that be hypothetically an accretive acquisition?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I don't think of it as accretive. We already own 49%.","Lee Adrean","Well, 50%.","Richard F. Smith","50%.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So are you consolidating now?","Richard F. Smith","We don't consolidate.","Lee Adrean","Yes. And Andrew, by law in Russia, we're limited to 50% ownership.","Richard F. Smith","So it would be us -- it's just the government [indiscernible] partners is what we're talking about here Andrew.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Okay, I want to thank everybody for participating in the call today, and we'll be available this afternoon if you have any additional questions. Thanks again, and that concludes the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.  Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2011 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. Since our Brazilian operations were emerged with Boa Vista on May 31, 2011, we also present revenue growth excluding Brazil, to provide a clearer understanding of our revenue growth for those businesses that will continue to be reported in our operating results.","These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation and our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab at our website for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As most of you know, we've made a number of commitments to some important foundational principles, which have guided this company for the past 6.5 years. These principles include an intense focus on growth, new product innovation, accountability, LEAN, strategic acquisitions, as well as leveraging our analytic expertise and unique data assets across all business units. Our execution against these commitments continues to pay off. ","The momentum and broad-based performance we delivered throughout 2011 positioned us well for 2012. For the first quarter, strong double-digit growth from our 4 largest business units resulted in record revenue growth and record growth in adjusted EPS. The results were significantly ahead of our expectations as we entered the year. Shortly, I will update you on our full year outlook. But as you would assume, our optimism and confidence for the full year has improved. ","Taking a quick look at some of the high-level financials for the quarter, total revenue was $523 million, up 11% over a year ago, excluding Brazil. Total revenue was up 15% for the quarter and up 16% in constant dollars. Our operating margin was 27 -- or 24.7%, up 160 basis points from a year ago. Finally, adjusted EPS was $0.70, which is up 21% from $0.58 a year ago. And as I normally do, I'll go through some highlights of each of the 5 business units, then I'll hand it over to Lee for the financials. ","Starting with USCIS. They had one of their strongest quarters ever, bolstered by very broad-based growth. The theme, by the way, you're going to hear throughout all of the units. This performance in the first quarter was extremely broad based. We had great growth in Auto, Telco, FIs, Mortgage and Insurance.  We also increased our transaction with new products, accelerated the transaction activity in many of our larger customers and drove new strategic pricing programs across the board. ","Although -- along with strong revenue performance, operating margins in Online Consumer Information Solutions and Credit Marketing Services expanded nicely during the quarter, and with the primary drivers behind a 241 basis point improvement in USCIS' operating margin versus a year ago. Our execution in targeted verticals continues to improve and is delivering meaningful incremental revenue growth. ","During the quarter, we had double-digit growth in our key client program. And to refresh your memory, the key client program of the top 4 banks in the U.S. are what we focus on. We also had great double-digit growth in our channel partners in addition to Telco, Auto, Financial Services and Insurance sectors; all double-digit growth. ","We have consolidated all of our analytic talent throughout the organization to further leverage their expertise, their familiarity with our vast array of data assets and deep understanding of our customers' needs in today's fast-changing and highly competitive market. That was done just a quarter ago and the benefits of that new structure should yield in the coming quarters.","Continuing with USCIS. Transaction with our new products continues. Of the products launched in 2009, 2010, and 2011, 29 of those products are now delivering revenue that exceeds our NPI target for the quarter, and those are allowing us to win in the marketplace. We're also in the beginning stages of developing strategies for new applications that use our vast data assets and analytical capabilities, such as mobile payments and marketing. ","We continue to make good progress in the government sector, particularly with our ID management solutions. In Retail Banking, we have completed the development of the DDA checking account score, which will be used in the account opening process. This new product will be launched in the second quarter.","Finally, USCIS has intensified their sales efforts to increase the penetration of TALX Workforce Solutions products into the financial sector. And performance was significantly ahead of our target for the first quarter.","Moving on to International. International, excluding Brazil, continues to leverage its strong market position to deliver strong double-digit growth at very attractive margins. As we have said in the past, International is a very important contributor to our long-term growth. We'll continue to invest aggressively to expand the contributions of International revenues, but we'll maintain our disciplined approach to ensure they deliver an appropriate return to the shareholders.","International's new product innovation in key industry focus was made with major contributors to a strong double-digit growth in both Europe and Latin America, when you exclude Brazil. NPI represented 9% of revenue for the quarter, and some very successful products came out of the mix and new products were introduced into these markets. And from revenue, from Financial Institutions, Telco and Auto sectors, all grew at strong double-digit growth rates for the quarter.","In the U.K., our Personal Solutions product line brought an amazing 53% in the quarter. To ensure continuous success, we are leveraging the skills and expertise of our North America Personal Solutions team, led by Trey Loughran, and their technology platforms to support a broader, more diversified product portfolio mix in the U.K.","Analytical services, which represents almost 10% of International revenue, delivered strong double-digit growth in all geographic segments. In short, a strong broad-based performance driven by solid execution in our core business initiatives.  Moving on to TALX Workforce Solutions, experienced very strong broad-based growth. Again, a theme you're going to hear across the company. That growth was across all verticals for The Work Number. Mortgage, Consumer Finance, Government and Pre-employment were all up strong double-digit.","We've identified a number of new opportunities that further monetize The Work Number database. For example, in 2011, over $48 million of revenue came solely from historical records in the database. Pre-employment screening, auto reviews and due diligence activities are all creating new opportunities to leverage these historical records, and that trend will continue going forward.","Total records for the database were up 4% for the quarter, and we added 79 new contributors of data in the quarter. In addition, a number of initiatives are underway to broaden and further penetrate our verifier base. We're making good progress on bundling the additional services with our existing verifier customers and entering non-mortgage related verticals to drive highly profitable incremental revenue growth.","Finally, for TALX, the eThority acquisition, which we made in 2011, is enabling TALX to develop high-value added analytic product offerings that will deepen our relationship with employers who contribute data into The Work Number database.","Next, PSol. North America Personal Solutions delivered another strong performance, driven by its high-value product offerings, strong customer relationships and commitment to continually improving performance on their key metrics such as churn, ARPU and subscriber base.","Market penetration continued to be strong as new build subscribers additions in the U.S. grew by 14% in the quarter. We're also leveraging our U.S. technology platforms and product portfolio in Canada, and as I've mentioned before, in the U.K., to further their success in the direct-to-consumer market.","Finally, North American Commercial Solutions. Their results were below our expectations for the quarter with growth of 1%. Transaction-based revenue on the risk side grew 10%. But project-based revenues fell as we saw corporate clients cut back on or delay or reduce the size of discretionary spend on projects. However, based upon the current pipeline of revenue opportunities, we see growth improving in Commercial for the balance of the year. Overall, our performance for the first quarter was better than we expected and provided a very strong start to the year.","Lee, if you'd take it from there?","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll be referring to the financial results generally presented on a GAAP basis. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.","Continued strong execution from our 4 largest businesses, coupled with a better-than-expected mortgage market and the incremental operating leverage in our transaction-oriented segments enabled us to deliver very successful first quarter performance. Compared to the same quarter in 2011, for the first quarter of 2012, consolidated revenue of $523 million was up 11% on a reported basis and 15% when Brazil is excluded from 2011 revenue. ","Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue was also up 11% or 16% excluding Brazil. Operating margin was 24.7% compared to 23.1% in the first quarter of 2011. And diluted EPS attributable to Equifax is $0.58, up 27% from the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related and intangible amortization, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $0.70 a share, up 21% from the first quarter a year ago.","Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $218 million, up 20% over a year ago. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $149 million, up 24%. About 1\/3 of this growth came from the mortgage sector, which explains the acceleration of growth from the fourth quarter of 17% growth rate. The remaining drivers of this high-growth were largely the same factors which drove the fourth quarter, new products, conversion of new customers, certain pricing actions taken a year ago and growth in transaction demand from existing customers.","First quarter online volume was up 16%, continuing the strong double-digit growth that began in the fourth quarter. Mortgage Solutions revenue of $34 million was up 26% compared to the first quarter a year ago. Both core mortgage reporting and Settlement Services delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter.","Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $34 million, up 2%. Credit Marketing Services delivered broad-based, double-digit growth in the quarter, more than offsetting a lower level of project revenue in our IXi segment. The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 36.5%, up from 34.1% in the first quarter of 2011.","Our International revenue was $121 million. Excluding Brazil, following its deconsolidation in the second quarter of 2011, reported revenue grew 12% and local currency revenue growth was 15%. By region, Latin America's revenue was $47 million. Excluding Brazil from the prior-year comparison, reported revenue grew 15% U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency.","Growth was broad based, beginning with solid double-digit growth in Consumer and Commercial Information, and strong double-digit growth in technology and analytic services and marketing services. Europe's revenue was $43 million, up 15% in U.S. dollars and up 18% in local currency. Workload, which accounted for approximately 5 points of growth, along with solid double-digit growth in U.K. Analytical Services, U.K. Personal Solutions and Iberia were the primary contributors to another strong performance in this geography. ","Added Consumer Information revenue was $31 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency. Strong double-digit growth in our analytics solutions, including conversions to our generic risks or portfolio insights and neighborhood view were the principal drivers of this growth.","International's operating margins was 31.8%, up from 23.4% in 2011, reflecting primarily the deconsolidation of Brazil in the second quarter. Margin expansion in the U.K. and Canada also contributed positively.","For the quarter, TALX Workforce Solutions revenue was $114 million for the quarter, up 14%. Verification Services, with revenue of $57 million, was up 37% for the quarter. Approximately 60% of that growth came from broad-based organic growth in mortgage, government, consumer finance and pre-employment online verifications, while the remaining growth came from the acquisition of DataVision in August a year ago.","Employer Services revenue was $57 million, down 2%, primarily due to lighter unemployment compensation claims activity. The TALX operating margin was 23%, up from 21.9% in the first quarter of 2011, largely due to the strong performance in Verification Services.","North America Personal Solutions revenue was $50 million, up 11% from a year ago. Strong double-digit growth in business to consumer subscription revenue was driven by single-digit growth in ending subscriber volume and double-digit growth in ARPU, as new customers purchase and existing customers trade up to the higher value Equifax complete suite of products.","Canada exhibited strong double-digit growth as a result of leveraging our U.S. technology platform and product portfolio in Canada. Strong double-digit growth in subscription revenue more than offset declines in both breach and transaction revenues. And our operating margin was 28.3%, down slightly from 28.7% in the first quarter a year ago, reflecting stronger marketing activity.","North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $21 million, up 1% on a reported and local currency basis. Strong double-digit growth in transaction revenue was offset by lower risk and marketing project-related revenue. The operating margin was 16.8%, down from 24.9% in the year-ago quarter, primarily resulting from the lower project revenue and continued investment in the long-term strategy for this business.","Corporate expense was up 49% compared to the first quarter of 2011, largely due to executive stock-based compensation that occurred in the second quarter in 2011, but was moved to the first quarter in 2012 to coincide with our annual board evaluation of management. And 2 additional incentive compensation, driven by our very strong first quarter outperformance. ","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Lee. On the second quarter outlook, assuming current exchange rates and excluding Brazil, we expect to deliver revenue growth from continuing operations between 12% and 14%. And adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be between $0.70 and $0.73 a share, which will be up 15% to 20% when you compare it second quarter of 2011. With strong performance in our core markets and continued effective execution on our initiatives, our optimism and confidence for the full year of 2012 outlook has clearly strengthened from a quarter ago. ","Now, although the mortgage market has been much stronger in the first quarter when compared to original expectations, we now expect it to start slowing as we exit the second quarter, enter the third quarter for the balance of the year, and come closer to the range we gave in our release in February.  As a result, our view of the full year is that revenue growth for the company, excluding Brazil, will now be between 10% and 12%, which is at or above the upper end of our long-term growth rate target we've talked about in the past. ","As we said in the past, earnings should grow an additional 2% to 3% as improved -- as a result of improved operating and financial leverage. If the mortgage market does better than we expect, we should be able to deliver even stronger performance over the year. Time will tell how the mortgage market unfolds. ","Along with our improved outlook for the year, I want to provide you an update on each of our business units and how they are looking for the balance of the year. Starting with USCIS, we expect them to deliver double-digit revenue growth despite tougher year-on-year comps as we exit this year. TALX Workforce Solutions is expected to deliver upper single-digit growth for the year as they continue to drive new product innovations, market segmentation and expand the record count for the Work Number database. ","Personal Solutions will continue to leverage momentum from 2011 to deliver double-digit revenue growth in 2012. In Commercial Solutions, we have a great -- we had great customer traction with our transaction-based services. But I've mentioned before, we experienced some challenges with our project-related revenue. But the pipeline is strong and the momentum will pick back up and as a result, we anticipate 2012 revenue growth will be in the upper single-digit range. International still should continue to deliver strong double-digit revenue growth for the year. ","So operator, with that, we would it up open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Carter Malloy with Stephens Inc.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First off, I want to talk about the core OCIS business. Really big growth in there, even when we strip away a lot of things. So I assume pricing played a key role there. And if you'd give a sort of overview of pricing, as well as -- specifically, within the affiliate channels there, what type of moods we saw this quarter?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. Again, what you saw was a very high level. But this growth, as you stated in USCIS, was extremely broad based. Almost every major vertical that you can think of was up strong double-digit, so -- which is great. NPI continued to play a big role as well. On pricing, we did announce a series of pricing initiatives middle of last year, Carter, which will sunset as we exit the second quarter of 2011. And that did pay -- pay some dividends for stock. Mortgage obviously was strong, that gave us a little bit of growth as well. Transaction volume, though, was extremely strong, as we mentioned in the numbers as well. Specific to the -- was it the resell market you were...","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","We don't have those on the book now.","Richard F. Smith","We don\u2019t have them, Carter.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Understood, no worries. And then as far as your International outlook, also very strong there in their performance. Can you drill down specifically on Europe and U.K., sort of external of Iberia? And also why exactly PSol is up so much and should that continue?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. The growth in Europe was broad-based, as you mentioned. Iberia was very strong, which is counterintuitive to the -- what you read and see in the markets in general terms in Iberia. U.K. continues to be extremely strong across all verticals, all markets. Most of it organic, Lee gave you a breakout there. If you extract out the Workload acquisition, I believe it was like 13%, 14% organic growth. So, strong. Specific to PSol in the U.K., that growth -- it's been a renewed focus from the leadership team in the U.K. Leveraging best practices and ideas that have helped the U.S. win and helped Canada win. We're now deploying those at a rapid rate in the U.K., so just a fabulous result in the U.K.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's great. And then lastly, of The Work Number revenues, how much of that exactly is mortgage related?","Richard F. Smith","We don't break that out specifically, Carter. But again, if you -- my words, and I think Lee talked about it as well, The Work Number growth was extremely broad based. And you're getting accelerated growth in non-mortgage and rate growth from the mortgage sector. So it's -- it's broad based, not just mortgage.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Understood. But would it be fair to say that it's still, at this point, a majority mortgage at least?","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple, actually. Rick, as you consider the mortgage environment and your expectations for a normalization, if you will, can you talk about what you think sustainable volume growth is in a recovering U.S. consumer credit economy within your USCIS segment?","Richard F. Smith","For the core non-mortgage or core mortgage?","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Well, no, I'm -- I'm actually asking about what you think total volume growth will be in the segment assuming a more normalized mortgage environment. So rather than the upside we've seen in the last couple of quarters.","Richard F. Smith","Yes. So if you exclude the upside in mortgage, and look at just the core -- so you forget some of the new product innovation initiatives that Rudy and his team are driving -- how do you expect mid single-digit kind of growth going forward for the core USCIS?","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I'm not sure if you mentioned it in your prepared remarks this quarter, but how much revenue growth did USCIS enjoy from NPI?","Richard F. Smith","I did not. It's -- I mentioned 29 products, part -- that exceeded our expectations over the last 3 years. I don't have that off the top of my head. They're performing at or above the company level.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So it's safe to assume it's a couple of points kind of -- at least kind of consistent with prior quarters?","Lee Adrean","Yes.","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one more, if I might. Regarding incremental USCIS profitability. Given the very high level of volume, margins are up year-on-year. But we haven't really seen a meaningful acceleration. Should we expect one? Or what's the dynamic there as we continue to see volume recover?","Richard F. Smith","Are you referring specifically to the USCIS?","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes. The segment margin.","Richard F. Smith","Lee?","Lee Adrean","Yes. I mean, it is up 240 basis points, which I consider to be pretty good. But of the watch outs you have to look for in that business, a couple of things: First, when mortgage happens to be a strong driver of growth, certain of the mortgage revenue is very high incremental margin, but certain of it, such as our tri-merge reporting, our Settlement Services have significant pass-through costs. So the blended margin on the incremental margin is not -- mortgage is not the same. It's just selling a whole lot more credit report. So you got to be a little careful on that point. The other, and it comes back to the point you raised about NPI is, we're not going to sustain, Rick said, mid-single digits. And of course, internally, we're trying to push to higher levels than that. But we're not going to sustain that simply sitting here and waiting to sell more credit reports. So we're driving a lot of investment in new product. We're moving into some new end use markets and channels. And all of that takes some level of investment. And at these rates of growth, I think people would be very, very happy with the growth we're achieving, while still expanding margins. But it's not going to -- 240 basis points is darn good and it's not going to accelerate from that rate of growth. But we do think over the next year or 2, we continue to see some improvement in the margin in that segment.","Operator","Our next question will come from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Wanted to lead off on the OCIS side. You mentioned a number of different things driving outsized growth there. Has anything changed on the competitive front? Are you winning more business competitively? And then as you kind of look out to the back half of the year going forward, on the pricing side, obviously it's been favorable now for the last couple of quarters. Should we expect kind of a more normalized environment where there's a bit of a negative delta between the report growth in your actual OCIS revenue growth?","Richard F. Smith","2 good questions. On the first piece, it's a couple of thoughts, it's a continuation of what you've seen the last couple of years, George. It is one, because we have a unique data asset, we are solving problems we couldn't solve before. Hence, the consumers are spending new monies that they never spent before. So the pie of opportunity has grown clearly. That's number one. And number two, as we've highlighted in the past, we have taken share in different sectors, different verticals over the past few years in the U.S. and that continues to benefit us. As far as pricing goes, we invest a lot of money, a lot of time and energy on segmentation, bundling, strategic pricing and the general trend is an improving trend there. The spike you're seeing now over the last 6 months or so, I'm not sure that's sustainable at this level, long term. That mean -- we -- we'll not continue to invest in strategic pricing, but we've got a significant step up, as you know. Where we used to see 1 to 2 points of compression in pricing, we're now seeing pricing expansion.  I would think long term it would get closer to equilibrium possibly. And so we're not counting on the expansion you see now for -- lasting forever.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. That's very helpful. And just last question for me. Can you just give us overall what the contribution for mortgage was in the quarter, just overall mortgage business in general?","Richard F. Smith","We tend to say that mortgage runs between 14% and 22% of total revenue. We're clearly in that range, we're somewhere in the upper teens for this -- for the first quarter.","Operator","And next we'll go to Rayna Kumar with Evercore Partners.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm calling in for David Togut. Can you please provide us with an update on the Boa Vista merger, maybe including the key milestones and where you see the margin outlook for this business?","Richard F. Smith","Sure. I was just down there, Rayna. That was the -- with the team. It's going as planned. The integration of products, people, strategy with customers is all going well, culture. Financially, it's going well. We're in the process now of developing a medium-term new platform, IT platform for the business. So it's sitting on all cylinders. It feels good, it's been well-received in the marketplace by our customers as well. So it's on plan as we expected and hoped for a year ago.","Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. Also, what is your revenue outlook for TALX, maybe breaking it down between Verification Services and Employer Services? And where do you see this business progressing from here?","Richard F. Smith","We don't break a forecast down to that level, but I think I gave you a number earlier. So we expect it to be for the year, in the upper single digits. A strong growth this year.","Operator","And next we'll go to Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just on your guidance, what's the implied operating margin now with the raised outlook?","Richard F. Smith","When we talked earlier, I think it was first quarter, when we had our last call, our commitment was to get a 25 to 50 basis points improvement year-on-year, and that was a -- a long-term goal not just a short-term goal. So that still stands.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And with the increased revenue, I guess you're just investing more into the business?","Richard F. Smith","Correct.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you talked a lot about analytics. Recently, you mentioned it was 10% of International revenue. What's that number for the entire company? And also you talked about organizational changes you're making around analytics, talent. Can you talk a bit more about those changes and then the opportunities you're seeing with the analytics overall?","Richard F. Smith","Actually, we don\u2019t break out the total percent of revenue coming from analytics. We just typically give you the numbers as a percent of the data that comes to us -- just one of our analytical platforms. But I gave you the International just as a -- some insight that the analyst is really making a big difference in the International platform. Specific to the organizational change, yes, we had to spearhead activities across the company. No uniform, standardized approach analytics. And we have seen through other structural changes we made, if we create one centralized team, their ability to exchange ideas and best practices, leverage investments in one location for the benefit of other location, move talent around, so on and so forth just made a lot of sense. So we've got a great new leader exploring that, a guy who's been with us now for a couple of years. He came from one of the large banks, so he led their risk team there, really understands analytics and he's building a world-class team to take analytics to the next level for us.","Operator","And next we will hear from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just go back to some of the comments around discretionary spending in general. It sounded like you had 2 areas where discretionary was a little weaker in the commercial segment. And it sounded like also in part of the, if I'm not mistaken, I think it was part of the marketing area as well. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics around discretionary spending in those areas? Is this typical project-based work? Just a color and a dive in terms of what we might be seeing on the discretionary side of the project-based work, if you will?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I'd say, it's -- whenever you look at project-based work, it tends to be lumpy, Julio. At times, that lumpiness can be to our benefit. At times that lumpiness can be to our demise. And just some larger projects that both the marketing side of CMS and on the risk side of CMS was looking at and also in commercial just didn't manifest itself in the quarter. So -- I don't think it's -- it's not something systemic that I'm worried about long term. It's just uneven as a short term, [indiscernible].","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the commercial side -- sorry, I guess, on the marketing side, is there any way to sort of isolate whether the lumpiness in the project base sort of is coming out of any particular vertical. I guess the financial services verticals is the one I'm trying to sort of zero in on in terms of just some of the lumpiness here in the project business?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. On the marketing side, it was non-commercial.  On the marketing side, it is coming out of the advice.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then if you can parse through -- I'm just trying to make sure -- I think, just to make sure I understand the drivers of the upside. I think you gave the number for the NPI contribution, but there was also -- it sounded like some pricing and volume components. Maybe just to help us understand the upside surprise, either relative to your own numbers or your own altered expectations. Was it more volume or NPI? More new client spending? What would you sort of say was the most relevant component there to the upside here?","Richard F. Smith","Are you talking any specific business unit or...","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Well, I guess, if you wanted to focus on the USCIS part. Sorry.","Richard F. Smith","I'd say, in general terms, including USCIS, it is a far higher level of execution on our side. It is NPI continuing to run at very good levels. It is customers spending more money with us they have not spent in the past. Obviously, mortgage is up as well. It is truly, truly broad-based. Pricing, as you mentioned, was a benefit as well. And I'll be honest, we're getting a little help from the market, which is encouraging, excluding mortgage now because we know that's pretty strong. I wouldn't describe the market in the developing world as robust by any means, but for a couple of quarters now, we're seeing a little help from the economy. Banks starting to lend more, consumers starting to borrow more. So the underpinnings of a healthy business are for starting in the very early stages of -- of moving down the right path and helping the company.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the competitive front with the TransUnion transaction that went out. Any changes in the competitive dynamics that you guys are expected to see at this point or anything you might have said already?","Richard F. Smith","No. 2 years it has been and it will be a good competitor. They got good leadership team, good products. And I think the fact that Advent and Goldman Sachs now own them gives them some cash, possibly, to do some more things that they would have done in the past. But we respected them before they were bought by Advent and Goldman, and we respect them now.","Operator","And next we'll go to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","What -- can you guys just isolate, what was the constant currency organic revenue growth, excluding mortgage?","Richard F. Smith","I believe it was around 9% to 10%.","Lee Adrean","9%.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","9% flat?","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Lee Adrean","Shlomo, very simply, the mortgage market's combination of initiatives of our own plus the marketing activity was 5%, acquisition was about 2%, kind of organic non-mortgage was 9% out of -- that's the 16% constant dollar growth, ex Brazil.","Richard F. Smith","And Shlomo, the nuance in Lee's point that -- which should not be lost -- part of the mortgage growth is the market itself. Part is, we've invested heavily in innovation in mortgage. We're now selling products this year and last year that we haven't sold in the past. So a lot of that growth is just our innovation, our new products.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got you. I understand what you're saying. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from the credit card banks with regards to the underwriting standards. We're hearing just a bit of loosening is going on over there.","Richard F. Smith","I'd agree with that. I'd agree with that, that they're -- they are showing signs -- and our data shows it, they're showing signs of going down market. Sub-prime credit card issuance is on the rise, so -- yes, it's nowhere close to what you saw back in the 2004, '05, '06 time frame. But it's definitely a little more aggressive than you are seeing in 2010, '11.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Are you starting to see some copycats from competitors in there?","Richard F. Smith","I missed that; say that again?","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","In other words, are you seeing some banks dipping their toes in and then you're seeing other ones following them a quarter later?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. It's pretty universal.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- you'll like this one, Rick. If you saw the Mortgage Bankers Association Application Index up above 50%, how come the mortgage dilutions was only up 26%?","Richard F. Smith","That's great. One, if you think about the applications -- and you're right, they did -- the MBA -- it was up 50-some-odd percent. A couple of things are happening: One is that a massive backlog -- many of these banks are locking in for 4 months the rates because they don't have the staff to get out the mortgage applications to convert the -- convert the applications to actual underwriting originations. Secondly, a percentage -- and the GSE's estimate somewhat from 25% and 30% of the volume we are now seeing an application is tied to HARP. And as you know, Shlomo, HARP does not require a -- that they pull a credit report at time of initial underwriting. But they do require it at the time of the actual approval. So the combination of those two, say, originations are running at a lagging rate versus applications, but a big chunk of that will catch up once they actually get the approval.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So should we see some benefit in 2Q as we see some of that starting to flow through at the back end of those?","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Lee Adrean","Shlomo, I would also point out, we have observed periods in the past where the MBA index submerges fairly significantly for some periods from the volumes that we, and I think our competitors see. It's a sampling challenge for the MBA. And, just -- so I would not take the MBA application index as the definitive measure of market activity.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And then just in terms of the timing of using some of the corporate expenses, is that -- on a normalized basis, if I'm modeling out for different years, when should we expect the equity grants to come? Should we think of it now...","Richard F. Smith","First quarter.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","...we move from 2Q to 1Q?","Richard F. Smith","Historically, we're always Q1 and we made that move, I think, it was 2 years ago, Lee?","Lee Adrean","Yes.","Richard F. Smith","About half of the second quarter. And normally, you'd expect us to be on this cycle here, which is the first quarter, Shlomo. There may be exceptions to that. But the norm -- my, my preference is, and normal protocol would be first quarter.","Lee Adrean","Shlomo, one thing I would also point out, just thinking about the corporate line generally, we are undertaking some investments in systems infrastructure. Some things that we deferred through the recession but that are going to help us be more efficient and operate more effectively as an integrated company. Those -- just the initial piece started to hit in the first quarter. We're going to see higher levels of that investment later in the year. So there's definitely a timing element in the first quarter, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to see a big drop-off in the second quarter, because we are undertaking some of the things that are going to continue to allow us to operate as a highly integrated company and bring all of our strengths to bear across of our markets.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is that going to be a permanent step-up in investment spend or is that kind of a 1 to 2 year project?","Lee Adrean","It's probably a 2 year effort.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It's actually Matt Roswell in for Dan. One quick question and then sort of a longer question. The quick question is about operating margin increase year-over-year. How much of that is tied to the Brazil change and how much of that was that of core operating expansion?","Richard F. Smith","So we said at the time of the consolidation, was it 9 months ago, Lee? We get about 100 basis points of margin lift from the deconsolidation of Brazil, so you can just simple do the math and the balance is standard operating leverage.","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So -- I mean, was that fully in the first quarter? Because your operating margins were up about 60 basis points year-over-year and that would imply the core -- if Brazil was a 100 basis point tick up, that will imply that kind of ex-Brazil, margins would have been down year-over-year. Am I reading that correctly?","Lee Adrean","No. Our margins a year ago were 23.1%, moved up [indiscernible].","Matthew V. Roswell - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Yes. I see that now, thank you. The larger picture question, you've got revenue running ahead of expectations. Sounds like things are really good. Where should we see kind of reinvestment in the business this year? What sort of areas and then any changes to kind of capital deployment?","Richard F. Smith","I'll take a first stab and you do the deployment piece, Lee. Investment, continuing investment obviously in NPI like part of our growth. Investment, Lee just mentioned a second ago, investments from some of our systems infrastructure to allow us to operate more effectively and efficiently across the board. Third, to support the growth we'll continue to invest in some stacking where it makes sense, particularly in the sales product management, marketing, pricing arena. Those would be the 3 main areas. As far as capital deployment, Lee?","Lee Adrean","Really, no changes in terms of our priorities. Where we have appropriate acquisitions, we will pursue those. Appropriate meaning they fit our strategy and we can generate good returns for our shareholders. Beyond that, given where we are on our current capital structure, excess capital will generally flowback to shareholders through share repurchases.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Okay, operator, at this point, we'll conclude the call, and I thank everybody for their participation. And we'll be available this afternoon if you have any other questions. Thanks again.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8877":["Equifax Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns. Please go ahead, sir.","Trevor Burns","Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; Paulino Barros; John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our Web site at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in our filings with the SEC, including our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.","For the first quarter of 2017, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes, among other things, acquisition-related amortization expense, and the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes certain costs related to the cybersecurity incident. These include cost to investigate the cybersecurity incident, legal and professional services and a contingent liability for costs associated with providing free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection services to consumers. Included with cost related to the cybersecurity incident and therefore excluded from adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax of the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance IT and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our IT and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidated our global networking systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our IT infrastructure and further enhance our IT and data security are expected to occur throughout 2018 and 2019.","Adjusted EBITDA is defined at net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense net of interest income, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, and also as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding certain one-time items including costs related to the cyber security incident. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our Web site. In the Form 10-Q, to be filed later today, we will disclose the future losses from litigation or reasonably possible but not yet estimable at this early stage in the proceedings.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.","Mark Begor","Thanks, Trevor, and good morning everyone. I think as all of you know, I joined Equifax last week, so I'm into week two here at Equifax. It's exciting for me to join my first Equifax earnings call. And most importantly, take the helm of Equifax at such a pivotal time in our history. I want to start my comments by assuring consumers and customers of my absolute commitment, as well as our team's absolute commitment, to making Equifax a leader in IT and data security, to protect the sensitive consumer and customer data with which we have been entrusted, and to empower individuals to understand and manage personal data.","I also want to take a minute to thank Paulino for the outstanding job he did as interim CEO and for continuing to be a part of our leadership team into early 2019. During Paulino's time as CEO Equifax has made significant progress in four areas of focus outlined as critical to our success in transforming Equifax following the cybersecurity incident. And those four elements are: Number one, to protect and empower consumers. Number two, become an industry leader in data security and identity protection while transforming our IT infrastructure and data security to industry leadership levels. John will talk about the sizable investments in this are in the first quarter and in 2018. Third, rebuild confidence with customers and partners, and I'll talk a little bit about our progress there. And fourth, respond to and work with the government and other regulatory bodies as they investigate the incident.","In the fourth quarter earnings call, in early March, Paulino and John covered in detail our plans and progress across these areas. Ensuring continued consistent execution in this transformation in this massive infrastructure investment that we're making is critical to the success of Equifax, and has my personal commitment as well as the focus of the entire Equifax team. I came to Equifax two weeks ago because I believe in the business. I believe in the strategy and I believe in the team. Equifax's strategy over the past decade has been based on the sound yet simple principle of combining industry-leading analytics and machine learning, unique credit income and asset-based data, and customer-specific data to be a leader in creating new analytical products that solve customer problems in financial decisioning, identify verification, fraud identification, and human resource processes.","My experiences at GE and Warburg, including my two years on the FICO board position me well to take over this leadership role and help lead the transformation to deliver industry-leading IT and data security, improve customer support in customer-leading products and services. I'm convinced we have the opportunity to make Equifax again the leader in providing data-driven insights to our customers and deliver a great future for Equifax customers, consumers, employees, communities, and shareholders. It's that opportunity that drew me to Equifax, and I'm energized and excited to get going. In my first 90 days as Equifax CEO I'll work closely with my team to immerse myself in the business, and that's already underway. As I do this, I'll prioritize my efforts in a few critical areas of our transformation.","Number one, employee engagement in the team, delivering on commitments Equifax has made to consumers and customers requires that we fully engage our talented workforce and leadership team, deepen and expand that talent, particularly in IT and data security. And I think you know we're taking very aggressive steps there to improve the leadership team. And also bring new technologies in that we're deploying as a part of our IT transformation. I believe in our leadership team. They have deep domain. They understand our products, our customers, and technology. And I'm really excited about some of the new members of the leadership team. I think you know a few weeks ago, before I arrived, we brought in a world-class CISO leader, Jamil Farshchi, from Home Depot, and we're very close to landing a new CTO to bring into the business from another leading company.","Number two, execution in our critical IT and data security and IT transformation initiatives. This includes the continued focus on ensuring Equifax strengthens its security first culture with supporting governance. It also includes a focus on people and talent acquisition in these highly competitive areas. And we're being very aggressive about attracting the absolute best talent in the IT and data security space. We're investing heavily to ensure we are market leaders around data security, and we will also enhance the transparency of all our transformation efforts with all our constituents, our customers, consumers, and the public as we drive this transformation forward.","Number three, strengthening customer and partner relationships and reestablishing trust in Equifax as a premier partner. I'm already out meeting with customers. I had a meeting two weeks ago. I've actually got a dinner tonight with a customer and another one tomorrow in Boston. Engaging with customers is a critical priority to me and our leadership team. We're all out there spending time to customers to regain their trust and confidence in our business and in the initiatives that we're taking to enhance our data, and data security and IT infrastructure.","Number four, strengthening consumer support, both in processes and technology. And importantly, building a culture focused on continuously improving customer support. This is another area that's central to me in my nine years leading the Synchrony Financial business at GE when it was a part of GE, that B2C interaction with customers was critical to me, and it's one of the many things I'm going to be bringing to Equifax. I'll also focus time and meeting with our shareholders in getting your input on our performance and our direction. I expect to begin those meetings in the coming weeks. Engaging with shareholders is a big priority for me, and I look forward to meeting with you in the coming weeks and months.","First quarter was a solid start to the year for Equifax. We made positive progress in the quarter and our focus areas for improving IT and data security, improving consumer support with the launch of Lock & Alert, as well as importantly, in progress with our customers and our financial performance. I'll walk through the highlights of the quarter, and then John will take you through the details on our results.","Total revenue for the quarter was $866 million, up 4% on a reported basis and up 3% on a local currency basis versus last year. Adjusted EPS was $1.43, down 1% versus last year. Both revenue and adjusted EPS were above our guidance range and better than our expectations. So we feel some really positive momentum coming out of the first quarter. USIS revenue was down 1% versus last year, consistent with the guidance we provided in March. Total online revenue was down about 2%. Marketing services was down slightly, although importantly we saw continued growth in credit marketing services. Trey and his team are making great progress with working with our customers regarding the reviews following the cybersecurity incident. I've been part of many of those. We have institutionalized more formal customer communications. We're holding regular updates with both security and the non-security leaders from our customers. And I've been a part of those also.","In the period after the breach customers were naturally focused on the incident and rebuilding confidence and trust. While that is still a central priority and topic of discussion with our customers, we're also seeing then increasingly willing to reopen discussions with us about new business opportunities, and our pipeline is strengthening for both new applicable [ph] core and new products. Our customers are focused on our investments in data security and infrastructure, but they also want to get back to a normal growth discussion with us. We continue to have success moving our customers to that normal position around new and expanded business. This allows us to better engage in new products as well as the credit marketing service transactions we've discussed in both third quarter '17 and fourth quarter '17 earnings calls.","Our Workforce Solutions business had a very solid quarter with revenue up 6% versus last year, slightly better than we expected. Importantly, verifier revenue was up a strong 12% driven by the strong growth across governments, talent solutions, mortgage, and debt management. Employer Services was down 3%. So Workforce Solutions and Rudy and his team had a very solid quarter in the first quarter.","John and the international team had another strong quarter with revenue up 13% on a reported basis and 9% on a local currency basis slightly stronger than our expectations. Latin America and Asia Pacific had their double-digit local currency revenue growth in European credit operations in Canada continue to serve strong single digit local currency growth.","Lastly European debt services declined in the quarter specifically in our venture with U.K. government. Global consumer revenue was down 3% on reported basis and down 4% on local currency basis, a slightly better performance than we had expected. U.S. consumer direct revenue declined 21% in the quarter again within expectations as we indicated last quarter, we will not be doing any advertising in our U.S. Consumer Direct business through at least the second quarter 2018 and therefore we will see continued decline in revenue driven by customer churn.","We expect to make a decision on the U.S. Consumer Direct business over the next over the coming quarters. This decline was partially offset by growth in our reseller business and the Canadian Consumer Direct business as we have seen continued growth in these two operations and also our ID watchdog acquisition performed well in the first quarter. While our first priority must be to deliver our IT and data security and IT transformation commitments and to continue to improve customer support, it's also a critical importance that we get the broader team at Equifax back to focusing on the essential operations, operating practices that will drive us to move back to a leadership position in delivering new products and insights to our customers.","So I'm spending a lot of my time both balancing on the infrastructure of data security investments they're making but even as importantly working with our teams to get back to focusing on customer growth.","New product innovation or NPI has consistently been a growth lever for Equifax and is off to a strong start in 2018, despite being impacted as we focus project management and technology resources on IT and data security, we're tracking to plan with a consistent number of NPI launches versus last year which is good news. Several of the new products we believe has strong revenue potential and NPI will be a strong focus in the second quarter and in the future for all of us at Equifax.","Our global data and analytics practices is critical to NPI and leveraging Cambrian Ignite direct and Ignite marketplace to advance our capabilities and combining Equifax public and customer data utilizing sophisticated analytical techniques to deliver industry leading insights. We now employed Cambrian in four major geographies, the U.S., Canada, Australia and most recently Argentina we quickly followed Cambrian deployments with global deployments of customer facing Ignite Direct and Ignite marketplace, these solutions which are based on Cambrian capabilities provide clients with Premier data in advanced analytics in support of full analytic lifecycle from data access to insight development and deployment.","Cambrian Ignite Solutions routinely incorporate machine learning into customer decisioning, an example of how we're using machine learning to improve results is our Patent Pending Neuro Decision Technology or NDT, NDT is the first regulatory compliance machine learning credit scoring system reviewed by regulators and credit scoring experts. This technology develops a neural network model that improves performance and accuracy and gives customers the ability to make more informed decisions when assessing risk. This unique process is important to customers and regulators and enable the deep learning of customer behavior is applicable and deployable wherever traditional score cards are appropriate. So we're excited about this new technology.","In the first quarter, we also launched an extension of FraudIQ in the U.S. which allows us to better identify bust out fraud which we all know is in increasing industry problem. FraudIQ utilizes unique machine learning techniques which will address this growing industry issue. Launch of Cambrian Ignite in Argentina demonstrate the progress we're making to deploy Cambrian Data in analytics platform globally, the Ignite solution is providing customers in Argentina with access to more data bringing our data together with our customers data and enabling faster and improved decisioning. We're also employing NDT in Argentina to enhance the performance of customers scoring models in that area. Other drivers in NPI revenue in 2018 continue to include InstaTouch, Digital IV, ID and Fraud and a variety of new such solutions in the housing and auto verticals.","Continuing to ramp up NPI new product efforts with our customers will be a critical priority for me and our entire team in the second quarter and beyond. I and the entire leadership team at Equifax are committed to delivering on the critical objectives discussed today and in the past quarters. We're committed to regaining the consumers and confidence and how we manage and secure information. We're also committed to regaining the trust of our customers and partners. This is the priority for the team and a priority for me personally. And making Equifax the industry leader in IT and data security while delivering new products that deliver unit insides that allow our customers to execute against their most value creating opportunities is critical to Equifax.","I'm excited to be at the and here at Equifax and excited to be part of the team and I'm excited about the path forward for Equifax. I support the team strategy. I support the leadership team. The first quarter is a solid start to 2018. We have a lot of work to do and we're making very strong progress.","With that, let me hand it over to John.","John Gamble","Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. As before I'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. For 2018 additional items excluded from our non-GAAP results or the onetime costs related to the cybersecurity incident. We'll provide the details on those items you can consider at your analysis.","In total in 1Q, '18 we incurred non-recurring cost related to the cybersecurity incident of $79 million. These have been partly offset by insurance recoveries of $10 million resulting in a net non-recurring charge of $69 million. The non-recurring charges excluded from adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS.","$29 million of gross costs were generally for legal fees and other professional services principally related to outstanding litigation and government investigations related to the cybersecurity incident, $46 million were generally for one time incremental project and other costs incurred to implement our IT and data security plans improve our infrastructure and develop and launch the lock-and-alert free service launched in 1Q, '18.","Going forward, all operating costs related to lock-and-alert will be included in our ongoing P&L. $4 million in accrued and incurred gross expenses related to the trust at IT premier service we offered free to all citizens. Give up cost were offset by about $10 million of insurance recoveries committed in 1Q, '18. Total non-recurring in onetime thing incremental project and other gross costs incurred since 3Q, '17 related to the cybersecurity incident are $243 million. We have a $125 million of cybersecurity insurance under our E&L policy against which we received commitments to pay $60 million in recoveries today which partially offsets the cost reference above. We continue to expect to made claims the fully utilized policy.","For Equifax in 1Q, '18 as Mark indicated revenue of $866 million was up 4% from 1Q, '17. Cash EPS of a $1.43 was down a penny per share from last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.5% in 1Q, '18 down 250 basis points from 1Q, '17; about two-thirds of the reduction in margin reflects the increased security related insurance and other ongoing costs is specifically referenced in March as part of our 2018 guidance.","Much of the security increases, much of the increases in security related ongoing costs are being incurred directly in business units. As we discussed in March we are expecting continued revenue impact from the cybersecurity incident in USIS and Workforce Solution in 2018 with a greater impact in the first half of 2018 and the impact of planning for other remainder of the year. This continues to be our expectation however at this point going forward wills not quantifying impact at the length of time since the incident does not allow for reasonable comparison versus premiums and expectations. USIS revenue in 1Q, 2018 was $307 million down 1% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and consistent with our expectations.","Online information solutions revenue was $220 million down 2% was compared to the year ago period. Identity and fraud solutions and commercial risk online drove the majority of the decline. The decline in identity and fraud was more than explained by the decline in our government business. We saw decline in commercial risk online as we transition to CFM. We expect commercial risk online to return the growth in the second half of 2018, core online was also down about 1%.","Over mortgage related revenue for USIS is up 8%. Total mortgage related revenue for Equifax including Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue was up 9%. Our mortgage revenue growth was stronger than the overall market which saw inquiries declined 3%. USIS mortgage solutions business in which we sell Tri bureau mortgage reports was benefited by the launch of three bureau trended data for mortgage.","In 2Q, 2018, we expect mortgage market volumes to be down high single digits for 2Q, 2017 and for all of 2018 we continue to expect mortgage market volumes to be down about 10%. Financial and marketing services revenue was $46 million in 1Q, 2018 down slightly just under $100 million. Importantly credit marketing services revenue which represents about 80% of financial marketing services revenue was up slightly in 1Q, 2018 as it was in 4Q, '17. IXI revenue was down in the quarter over IXI revenues traditionally lumpy and the decline in 1Q '18 reflects the delay in timing of specific transactions.","As Mark indicated earlier, we continue to make progress working with customers and the reduced volume in cybersecurity incident. For our discussion in March, our plans and guidance reflected diminishing impact of the event as being moved through 2018.","Consistent with prior discussions today, the principle impact then our ability to sell products into certain customers impacting NPI and to sell best transactions in financial marketing services, principally credits marketing services as well as likely some impact online -- on some impact to online. This was resulted in loss sales and share as we have worked through this process. We believe that the good progress we have made today with customers will benefit our sales efforts as we look forward in 2018 and into 2019. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 44.1% down approximately 450 basis points from last year.","USIS margins were principally impacted in 1Q '18 by three factors. Revenue mix particularly increased mortgage represented almost half of the impact, remainder primarily reflected increased third-party cost particularly impacting mortgage and increased security related in other technology and legal cost.","Looking at 2Q, we expect USIS margins to increase substantially from 1Q '18 levels reflecting a lower mix of mortgage revenue and expense management. Workforce solutions revenue is 2011 million in the quarter of 6% when compared to 1Q 2017. The 12% growth and verification services that Mark referenced reflects double-digit growth across government panel solutions, mortgage and debt management and was slightly better than expectations. We also grew both active and total records again in 1Q '18.","In Florida, service revenue of $83 million was down slightly less than 3% from last year an improvement from 4Q '17. Workforce analytics is up slightly and continues to be impacted by uncertainty regarding the status of U.S. Affordable Care Act.","Unemployment claims, which makes up about half of the remainder of employer services is being impacted by the very low unemployment rate. We are also seeing some weakness across actual related services and on boarding businesses. The continued growth of the verification services and the work number and shift and mix of revenue toward verification services is positive long-term and consistent with our plan. The workforce solutions adjusted EBTIDA margin was 48.9% in 1Q '18 down a 130 basis points from 1Q '17. The decline was more than explained by the expected increase in cost related to security and technology partially offset by positive mix due to the growth in verifier. We continue to expect workforce solutions EBTIDA margins to be flat to up slightly in 2018 versus 2017. International revenue was $245 million in 1Q '18 up 13% on a reported basis and up 9% on a local currency basis.","Asia Pacific revenue was $82 million up 14% U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currency driven by strong growth in our government vertical and identify commercial and consumer products. Europe's revenue was $71 million in 1Q '18 up 15% U.S. dollars and 1% in local currency.","As Mark mentioned earlier, we saw high single-digit local currency growth on our combined U.K. and same credit operations. This was offset by a local currency revenue decline in our debt management business specifically in Aventure with the U.K. government. Aventure continues to deliver greater than expected value to the government. However, the U.K. government budget cycles are resulted in lower revenue in first half '18 than the prior year. We expect for the full year total debt services, local currency revenue to be about flat as U.K., as revenue with the U.K. government recovers in the second half of the year.","Latin America's revenue was $56 million in 1Q '18 up 10% in U.S. dollars and up 15% in local currency. Revenue growth was broad based with strong double-digit local currency growth and our Argentina cluster as well as in Mexico and Ecuador. We also saw good growth across Chile and Central America. Canada's revenue was $36 million up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 8% in local currency. Candidates' growth was driven by online volume and analytical services and continues to reflect their strong execution.","International suggested EBITDA margin was 29.4% in 1Q '18 down 180 basis points from 1Q '17. The decline reflects expected increase random technology as well as growth in data and analytics spend as we expand globally.","Consumer solutions revenue, at $103 million in 1Q '18 was down 3% on a reported basis and down 4% on a local currency basis. Our U.S. consumer direct revenue declined 21% in the quarter. As we discussed in March, this reflects a reduction subscriptions as we did not advertise during 1Q '18 and will not for at least 2Q '18. U.S. consumer direct business is now just over 30% of GCS revenue.","Non U.S. consumer direct revenue was up slightly reflecting continued growth in Canada offset by a decline in the U.K. Our partner in reseller business, which is approximately 40% of GCS revenue, delivered mid single-digit revenue growth following growth in 4Q '17 as well.","Revenue in the quarter was benefited by the ID Watchdog acquisition completed in 3Qs. In a non-recurring cost associated with cybersecurity incident, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $65 million up $4 million from 1Q '17 reflecting expected increases and security transformation and insurance spend that we discussed with you in March.","Our GAAP effective tax rate of 23.9% includes a $3 million benefit from the income tax effective stock awards. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate using calculating adjusted EPS for 1Q '18 was 26.4%. We expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 26.5%.","In 1Q '18 operating cash flow was $120 million and free cash flow was $63 million up 15% and 19% respectively. Net cash flow benefited by lower cash outflow related to variable compensation and other working capital partially offset by spend related to the cybersecurity incident including capital spending, net of the cash received from insurance recoveries.","Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $56 million. For 2018, we continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 8% of revenue. Total net debt at the end of 1Q '18 was $2.38 billion. Our gross leverage was 2.43 times and net leverage was 2.2 times at the end of 1Q '18. We did not repurchase shares in 1Q '18 and do not expect Q1, Q2 '18.","Now turning to our guidance for 2Q '18, at current exchange rates we expect revenue to be between $880 million and $890 million reflecting growth of 3% to 4% versus 2Q '17. FX based on current exchange rates is expected to be a 1% benefit in the quarter.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be between 151 and 156 per share, this reflects the decline of 3% to 6% from 2Q '17 with no impact from FX in 2Q '18. Using the midpoint of our guidance range adjusted EPS increases approximately $0.11 per share in 2Q '18 versus 1Q '18, which is consistent with our average over the last five years. As a reminder, 2Q '17 was Equifax strongest quarter ever had adjusted EPS of a $1.60 per share and adjusted EBITDA margins of 39%. Our full year, 2018 guidance for Equifax revenue and EPS are unchanged from the March call.","In total, we continue to expect Equifax revenue for the year of between $3.425 billion and $3.525 billion. This reflects revenue growth of 2% to 5%. FX based on current rates is expected to be a 1% benefit to revenue in 2018. Consistent with our March guidance, this assumes total mortgage market volumes decline about 10% in 2018. We expected adjusted EPS to be between 580 and $6 per share unchanged from our March guidance.","FX is expected to be up 2% per share benefit to EPS in 2018. We continued to expect in 2018 to incur approximately $200 million of net incremental cost for investments and IT in data security projects and legal and professional fees being incurred specifically to address the litigation claims in governmental and regulatory investigations related to the cybersecurity incident. This represents gross cost of $275 million offset by $75 million of assumed insurance proceeds.","Investments in IT and data security are expected to represent about 75% of the cost. These costs are being excluded from our non-GAAP financial results and guidance. In 2Q '18, we expect these costs to be at or slightly less than what was incurred in 1Q '18. These estimates do not include any estimates or damages, fines or other announcements that result from the resolution of litigation and investigations relates to the cybersecurity incident.","Looking at the first half of 2018 using the midpoint of our 2Q '18 guidance, revenue was $1.75 billion and adjusted EPS of about 297 per share provides a very strong start to 2017 relative to our full year guidance.","And with that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you and welcome to the call, Mark. My first question, Mark, just in your initial assessment, I know you've talked about the commitment to security and infrastructure and there's clearly been a lot of spend in that area. I guess, how would you describe where you are in that process, early mid stages or how long do you think this continues? ","Mark Begor","Yes, Manav, good morning, and thanks for your comments. I'm only two weeks in so it's hard for me to give a detailed assessment. I'll ask John, maybe to weigh in also. But my look is that there's a lot of work that's been done in the last six seven months by the team, so we're making good progress. But I would also say it's still early days, there's still a lot of work to do. As you know, our new system has only been on the ground for less than 60 days, he is a really strong talent, he's bringing some new people in and I guess, in summary I would just, say early days. ","John, anything to add to that? We've got a lot of work to do in the rest of this year?","John Gamble","Absolutely. And we've indicated that the spend of the MD activities will run at least through 2019 and obviously as we move through 2018, as we have greater visibility, we'll update people on how we're doing.","Mark Begor","But just maybe to close on that, I hope you feel and others on the phone feel our commitment to this. This is a very large effort by the team, it's a massive undertaking and it's one that we're extremely serious about and we're committed to industry leadership around data security and it will go through for sure for the rest of this year.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then John, I think you went through it a little quickly, but just on the global consumer breakout, I think that was the area where it felt like you beat the expectations the most, but -- so I think you said that direct, which was a little over 30% of the mix was down 21%, and then did you say that the rest of the piece was up slightly and then I think in there you threw in something was up middle single digits as well. Can you just help me with that and what -- how much ID watchdog contributed to that?","John Gamble","Sure. So we said our partner and reseller, which is about 40% as ECS revenue, we said it was up mid single-digits. And our non-consumer direct revenue was up slightly. And that's really Canada and the U.K. and that was Canada growing and the U.K. declining and then ID watchdog contributed just under $5 million.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Rayna Kumar","Good morning, this is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. In terms of some of the government contracts that were delayed in previous quarters, can you just flush out how some of those conversations are going and if you can just provide us some milestones we can track so we can get a better idea of how your progress is with those contracts.","John Gamble","Yes, so I think we haven't actually spoken specifically about government contracts, but we've indicated rather that in general we continue to work with customers and that there have been some deferrals of agreements where we execute in our CMS business and our financial marketing services business. But as we talked about last quarter we said anything that's really been deferred since the cyber security incident which was in September we would assume as lost. And then going forward what we're doing is just working on winning new agreements with new customers.","And as Mark walked you through, we think we're making very good progress there in moving our customers to the point of considering new transactions with us and new products with us. So what we provided was some discussion around the impacts of the cyber security incident last year. But I don't think we specifically talked about government.","Rayna Kumar","Got it. One of your competitors is starting to sell trended data outside of mortgage and into the auto and credit card verticals; can you just discuss your plans with trended data?","John Gamble","Sure. Absolutely. So we consider trended data to be a critical part of our NPI process. We're seeing trended data growing in our business as well. We do think there's applications in auto, we do think there's applications in credit card, and trended data, quite honestly, is something we'll also start to apply around the world. So we would expect that we will see growth from those areas as we move through the future as well.","Rayna Kumar","Okay. And one final question\u2026","John Gamble","And we did just launch a commercial trended score this quarter. ","Rayna Kumar","That's very helpful. One final question from me, when do you expect to restart share buyback? ","John Gamble","Yes, so we talked a little bit about this last quarter, right, so until we have clarity around the outcome of the consumer and other litigation and class action litigation, we'll likely not be executing share repurchases until we have a good understanding of what that liability may look like.","Q - Rayna Kumar","Thank you.","Operator","All right. We'll move to our next question, will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman","Welcome, Mark. John, you just mentioned that the IT spend will run at least, \"At least through 2019,\" and then the last quarter the description was heavy lifting in IT spend and data security in 2018 and 2019, so my question is does Equifax have a full sense of what the total spend will be to IT and data security to build an industry leading system?","Mark Begor","I'll take the first crack at that and John should jump in with more color probably, but Andrew, great to connect with you here for the first time. The answer is no. We don't have that full visibility yet, we're working very hard to do that. The team has -- I would characterize is a pretty good visibility for what we're planning to do in 2018 and I think in the last quarter, John, we talked about that and decided that for you.","We haven't really gone beyond '18 yet, but my expectation is that there will be work that will go beyond '18 to complete our data security and infrastructure rebuild and as we get into the second half of the year, I would hope we can give you some visibility around that.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos","Good morning guys, and Mark, welcome aboard.","Mark Begor","Thanks, George.","George Mihalos","Just wanted to go back to one of your comments in your script around -- it sounds like the tenor of conversations with customers is improving. Are you seeing more inquiries though from non-traditional customers as well, basically people that have not been using Equifax in the past that are willing to have conversations around potentially buying some services?","Mark Begor","That's when I got lost. John, maybe can give you a little color on it. I'd give you some color on the customer meetings that I've been in is that customers want to understand deeply our investments and our pace around our data security upgrades. And as you know we've got a myriad of communication processes with the [indiscernible] customers, individual meetings with senior executives of our customers. So I would characterize the dialog that they appreciate the transparency, they expect the transparency. I think they're pleased with the scale of our investment and our commitment to it, how serious we're taking it and the comments that we've made about industry leadership around data security.","At the same time, my meetings with customers is that they also want to get back to the normal dialogs that we had pre the incident around growth, around new products, around NPI, so my interactions have been with existing customers, I don't know, John any color about beyond that?","John Gamble","Sure. Some of the new products we talked about last year a little bit like for example, InstaTouch, is starting to attract interaction for us with different parts of our existing customers as well as potentially with new customers. Also we've increased our activity in terms of pursuing fintech in the fintech markets. Some of it because of the new products we have offered and has been also further reasons. So we think that's an expansion of the focus that we have had probably over the past six to eight months.","George Mihalos","Okay, that's helpful. And then John, just as a quick follow-up, the Q2 guide on the revenue side suggests -- call it 3% revenue growth down a little bit from the 4% in the first quarter. Anything that particularly will be slowing down or is it just sort of the tougher comp in USIS that's impacting the number?","John Gamble","Generally, what should be occurring as you go up -- we're going to see GCS performance weaken, so that will be the thing that probably drives the impact more than anything else if we move through the rest of the year. We would expect you'll see the decline in consumer lightly accelerate.","George Mihalos","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Brett Huff","Good morning guys and Mark welcome to the call.","Mark Begor","Thanks, Brett.","Brett Huff","Two quick questions, one sort of a big picture one, we've kind of talked around it. But on GCS or the direct to consumer business, we've gotten a lot of questions on the fate of that. I know Mark, you're in the middle of that decision strategically, but could you just outline sort of the puts and takes or the main issues that you all are weighing as you consider that and then I have one follow-up.","Mark Begor","Yes, I'll start on that one and ask John to jump in too. For me it's early days on that. I've only been here for a little better than a week and a half and had some dialogs around it. Really what I want to take a hard look at is what are the opportunities? There's going to be real balance in the consumer space around a lot of the activities that we're going to deliver to consumers for free and that's something we're committed to and we're committed to giving consumers more control in access around their data and really looking at what are some of the paid services that we may offer in the future and value-added nature. So that's really the kind of calculus for me. I think I mentioned my background is kind of B2C from the synchrony updates and I got a real appreciation for both the protection of consumer data as well as a kind of value-added services you could add, you can deliver to consumers but it's going to take the better part of the second and the third quarter, I would think for us to come as a conclusions about a strategy there that we feel good about. We are going to be thoughtful about it and we will share that when we complete that analysis.","John Gamble","And as Mark covered, we are also relooking at to state basically the consumer direct market broadly because that market has been changing as we know over the past several years and how much of that market we believe is continue, going to be delivered direct or through resellers and through the premium models somewhat as Mark, referenced. So we look at the market in general to see what we think has happened, we did that a couple of years ago, we are doing that again now, and then, also obviously specifically whether or not we think we have anything differentiate that would let us participate well, if we think that market is still going to, is still going to be a growing opportunity. So, still more work to do.","Brett Huff","Thanks. It's helpful. And then, the second question is on the NPI, I know this is one of the key hallmarks of Equifax and something you guys continue do really well, part of your culture. But my understanding was, there was some shift in talent from some of the NPI, sort of projects to the cybersecurity incident issues, am I understanding that right and if so how do we think about the ongoing allocation of resources to NPI, how much talent will that -- will the cyber issues kind of heat up for long you know, that sort of negatively impact NPI in the near term?","Mark Begor","Yes, it's a great question. This one is on my mind just a short time I've been here. First is I think you properly point out NPI has been a real strength of Equifax as it's you want to think that many things that attracted to be the business there. They rigor their processes around partnering with customers around bringing new products to market and we got a long history of doing that and as you also pointed out there we have had and would some resources on the technology side and other areas working on the data security breach and infrastructure we built, but we are working hard, so we fill those resources on the NPI side. So we expect there will be some pressure there. My goal is to work hard to mitigate that with the addition of resources and focus around NPI because it's important to us and important to our customers going forward.","I think it's probably hard to articulate any kind of metrics around that plus there the first quarter was encouraging on the NPIs that we did bring to market versus our expectation. So even six plus months into - since the incident, we are bringing products to market but it will be real focus of ours to continue to resource that and make sure that momentum continues.","Brett Huff","Great. Thank you.","John Gamble","Thank you Mark and very confirmation progress with customer. So, one of the re-launching products, and then, obviously one of the impact as well as how rapidly we are able to turn them to revenue and so it's very important that we improve the engagement with customer as we are, so that we can get back to a more normal type with customer acceptance with the new products even after their launch. So, certainly an impact on NPI this year for those two reasons.","Brett Huff","Great. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, good morning guys. I appreciate, you taking the call. Look forward to working with Mark.","Mark Begor","Welcome.","Andrew Jeffrey","Have you think about this re-platform and obviously there are a lot of costs in management focus headed to it. But as you get past the technology investment and the security investment, have you started to think about how the new platform and the new delivery motion could benefit the long-term growth and competitive positioning of Equifax's business?","Mark Begor","Yes, I think it's a great question. Just wondered on my mind being nine days in here at Equifax and just wondered we are the heat of it obviously ramping up some projects around data security of our infrastructure rebuild. Some of the dialogue I had with the team of goals I'd like to get on the other side of this investment is speed of market with the investments we are making will allow us to bring products to market or quickly an ability to have higher dependability and liability of our infrastructure on the other side. So my goal is that after the market I hope it will improve our cost structure as we make some of these investments and first and foremost we are going to have a data infrastructure and a data security infrastructure that will be industry leading and that should position us well competitively going forward.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, and will you anticipate to the extent that our benefits associated with have been talking about this time next year, is that a reasonable expectation?","Mark Begor","At this time, next year I think having some visibility on our side in years around that, I think it's very, very simple and that's a great goal.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, and as a follow-up, with regard to the U.K. and TDX in particular John it sounds like some of the demand softness is transitory. Can you just fresh that out a little bit and how you think that impacts specifically the European sub segment revenue growth this year?","John Gamble","Yes, those we said the credit business performed very well, right with high single-digit local currency growth. So the impact really was specific to debt, with the debt service the business is very specific really mostly around the one large contract with the U.K. government. The contract itself is performing very well, we think we are collecting at rates that are above the expectations we are improving collections at rates that are above the expectations of our customer, which we think is very good.","However, the funding of the project is part of the U.K. government budget cycle and we are working through that right now. Obviously, that's something that's a little bit new to us, in terms of working through the U.K. government budget cycle, but it's specific to that cycle that has resulted in a lower level of activity in the first half of this year. So we are hopeful that we will be able to work through that and as I said to move back type of performance throughout the year but it isn't a issue of the performance of the product of Aventure is performing well, it's really just very specific to the U.K. government budget cycle.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh","Thanks. Mark maybe first one, it was helpful, you've given us a lot of contacts and I understand at early days in terms of your time there but to get to the high level a lot, what you describe I guess there are some other things I thought we are kind of in motion. Are there things that you would call out as you walk in at this point that you want differently you are emphasizing I guess maybe more than, we otherwise thought the kind of the plan was partially getting in it, just kind of understanding your perspective.","Mark Begor","Yes, I think first I'll start with - I think the team has been, has got a great plan in place and when I think about areas of interest for me nine days in is it's around the patent accountability about around all our projects, as you might imagine there is a lot of work being done here and I'm a big ownership accountability follow-up kind of leaders. So the team had prophecy to place around that, I will just say that I'm going to try to strengthen those and make sure that we are really executing on these projects on a timely basis.","Second, would be around this team was operating quickly. I'm a leader that that's the high bar and also my team and that place is really around let's get these projects done and get on with the next one. Third, would be around people, we are adding a bunch of resources here and I want to make sure we are adding top talent in the organization and retaining the talent that we have, so that's an important initiative and the last one is really around customers and transparency. I try to be clear about that and I think the team in the last few months was contributing towards a lot more open in transparent conversations with our customers and that's kind of a table six for me is being really clear with our customers having really strong relationships in connections with them and those four items I rather go off really aren't different probably from what they were doing but you can take from me perhaps some emphasis and really focus on those areas as being important and how I want to lead the business.","Tim McHugh","That's helpful. And John, one question, just numbers when the rest from five year old reports now being fully trended, I guess I believe that does that kick in I guess throughout the full year? Is that a type of a fact that we should see during the next couple of quarters?","John Gamble","We should yes, but that was I think the bulk of the quarter that occurred this quarter. So you will see it in any quarter going forward. Obviously mortgage tends to be a relatively high percentage of revenue earlier in the year in the first quarter and some of the second quarter investment does tend to tail-off but actually see that live throughout the year.","Tim McHugh","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Allison Chou","Hi, this is Allison Chou on for George. Thanks for taking my question. The International segment revenue grew 13% in 1Q has strengthened in couple of key regions, can you discuss how the operating environment for the International business is evolving and your outlook there as well as internal initiatives you have in place to sustain that growth?","John Gamble","Yes, so international actually performed very nice other than that management which we talked about international performed very nicely, the growth rate we talked about across Latin America, U.K., Canada, Australia, were all very good. We're fortunate that it looks like the economy is really in all of our major countries are going to perform we think relatively well this year and so we feel very good about that.","Some of the major focus areas for them are really continuing to be around NPI, Mark already covered it right NPI is the growth engine of the company, International has long been a very strong performer in NPI, they tend to perform frequently above our goal of vitality index of 10% and the deployment of Cambrian and then our decisioning systems international in international is really accelerating and our expectation is that will allow them to deliver new products faster and develop new products faster.","Also what Mark talked about in terms of delivering machine learning through Cambrian and now most of our major international markets we think is something that is going to be very beneficial as we go forward. So we're excited about it and the trend across those businesses really in the credit business has been very strong.","Allison Chou","Thanks, that's really helpful. And on NPI and kind of as a follow-up to Brett, you guys launched 17 new products in 2017 which is up about 30% year-over-year. Can you discuss how the ongoing personnel changes or kind of headcount shifts will impact the number of new product launches this year and NPI contribution or revenue growth?","John Gamble","Just fraction and we launched kind of mid-50s in terms of new products in 2017 that is correct.","Mark Begor","I think I mentioned in what is the prior question on NPI is there is no question, we've got some resource constraints versus pretty incident in all areas of business including NPI and as I said earlier we're working hard to backfill those resources that have been diverted over to work on the data security infrastructure rebuild and IT infrastructure rebuild. So I would say we expect to see some pressure, we want to work hard to try to mitigate that pressures we go through the year and it's it is only the first quarter and I think we said earlier the first quarter was a good start versus last year when it comes to NPI rollouts and we want to say on that important growth quarter for us.","Allison Chou","Great, thank you.","Operator","We will move next to Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bill Warmington","Good morning everyone.","Mark Begor","Hey, Bill.","Bill Warmington","So Mark, first of all welcome to you, I have to confess it, it's a bit of mixed feelings though because I think it's a nice hire for Equifax but we're losing you on the board in FICO, so that's kind of the offset. But you're welcome.","Mark Begor","I missed Will and his team have a great business and I enjoyed my three years on the board.","Bill Warmington","So a couple of questions for you, the first is and talking about the return of the project based business on the marketing side, I wanted to ask how are the reviews by clients going, are most of those now completed or they still there are some that are ongoing when you think, you can expect them to be completed and so you'll be fully greenlighted for new business?","John Gamble","Bill, I think it's really what Mark covered in his opening comments, right. We continue to make very good progress, the discussions are ongoing, we haven't really set an end date right and quite honestly probably continue as we through much of the year as we continue to make progress with customers. This is an evolving process but as Mark indicated, very good progress and moving conversations back towards normal, backward consideration of new products and backward consideration of the type of CMS jobs that have been impacted certainly last year and through this quarter to a degree. So we think very good progress but in terms of setting an end date I don't think that's something we can do.","Mark Begor","I will give you a live example from a meeting over there, a week ago Bill with one of our big customers, we spent the first 30 minutes or so giving an update on all the actions we're taking around the data security incidents, the investments and technology and in data security and the CEO of the business we were kind of halfway through our presentation and he said great dialogue let's spend the rest of the time talking about what we're going to do about partnering together help us grow.","So I think that an example of that, we're going to be in this dialogue with them for as long as I can see meaning the what the next three quarters or may be longer of reporting out how we're doing but customers are counting on us making those investments, they're counting on it making the data and infrastructure security improvements. They are serious in our progress and they want to get back to talking about business and growth in our NPIs and how we can help them grow.","Bill Warmington","And then my follow-up question for you is on the IT and security system side. It sounds like part of what has the preacher has done is given you an opportunity to really shut down a number of older versions of products and move clients to the latest base SaaS delivery as well and that sounds like a win-win in terms of getting the no more secure system and then also for you guys simpler and less expensive to support going forward. I wanted to ask how are those transitions going with clients have you found them receptive to it?","Mark Begor","I think their first off you hit the nail in the head. I think you laid out what we're trying to do and the opportunity for us in the benefit to come to ask our customers and the other side of this transformation and it's still early days, we're I would say the first John correct if I'm wrong but the first six months or so since the incident, most of our work was around our data security efforts and I would say in the last couple months we started to move towards lot of the infrastructure improvements that you described they have a data security elements to it but they're also going to bring a lot of simplicity; a lot of cost, hopefully improvements to us and also. Allow us to be faster the market with products because we've got a simpler infrastructure and how we interact with our customers.","John Gamble","And some of the transactions on the sizzling system our acceleration of the things that have been occurring so we been moving customers to SaaS system for some time this is just going to make they go much quicker.","Bill Warmington","Got it. All right, well thank you very much for the insight.","Mark Begor","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jeffrey Meulerw with Baird. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning guys. This is [indiscernible] on for Jeff. Just look at the margins outside of the GC as some of the other excitements I guess for little surprising to ask in the quarter. Despite stripping out the onetime cost you've outlined since trying to think about that John you mentioned the make shift to mortgage but is there anything else you guys can talk about what your ramping non onetime costs that may be impacting Q1 and then how that should sequence throughout the rest of 2018?","Mark Begor","Yes, so I think that in the bridges that we try to provide in the script, right, we did talk and I think in each of the businesses other than GCS really in and it present there as well about security and for information cost, we in the fourth quarter we have given some very specific discussion around cost we expected to incur in 2018 related to security and IT investments as well as related to as related to insurers costs and we think we're seeing those, they're impacting our those are certainly impacting that the margins we saw on the first quarter and will likely impact throughout the year is consistent with the guidance we gave in March.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, just specific to GCS given that you guys are marketing Q2 would you expect to similar kind of year-over -year margin in Q2 was relative to 2017?","Mark Begor","We didn't really provide guidance on margins but please do remember right we're going to see continue acceleration and decline of the Consumer Direct business, so the marketing spend is out was out in the prior quarters and you can see an acceleration in the decline of it consumer direct business. So that certainly has an effect on margin.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Ridley-Lane","Sure. Appreciate the details on revenue related to the U.S. direct-to-consumer business when you're making that decision on the business later this year with the direct consumer direct-to-consumer business still be profitable at that point just to help shareholders understand the potential impact?","Mark Begor","Obviously that the outcome of the decision, right, on how we are going to move forward will take into account the level of profitability we can deliver. So, at this point in time I don't think I can really address that specifically, but we will wait and see, we'll give you updates on how we are performing at USIS as we move through the year, and as we get to the point of making that decision obviously the level of profitability we think we can drive going forward will be an important consideration.","David Ridley-Lane","Understood. And just how is the NPI-related revenue contribution in first quarter of this year versus last year?","Mark Begor","Yes. So we don't generally give very specifics around NPI revenue by quarter. We tend to give it by year. And I think the update we gave today was simply to give people some perspective on the number of products that were launched in the quarter, so that we are seeing -- we are continuing to see momentum in product launches, but we had indicated pretty specifically that we would expect to see NPI revenue impacted in the year because of the customer impacts that we talked about a few times today.","David Ridley-Lane","Understood, thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our final question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni Kaplan","Hi. Welcome, Mark.","Mark Begor","Hi, Toni.","Toni Kaplan","I know this has been asked in a couple of ways and even on the last question, but I think it could be helpful in understanding, you know, there is a pretty start difference between your growth in USIS and that of one of your primary competitors and you mentioned the government deferrals, but is there some sort of way to quantify some of the impacts on the commercial side? So just directionally like, how much is sort of this lower growth coming from like lower upselling or versus delayed spending of customer, just directionally, or if you just want to quantify in some other way I think that would just be very helpful. Thank you.","Mark Begor","Yes, I think the level of detail we provided is what we can give right now, Toni. I mean, we specifically indicated that we're going to be trying to quantify dollar impact from the cybersecurity incident going forward, just because it's been so long since the event occurred that really isn't a reasonable comparison point. So at this point I think going forward we will talk about the revenue we generate and how it's moving forward, but I don't think we can provide more detail than we did in the script.","John Gamble","I think we said in the call a couple of times, there is no question that the USIS team is seeing some pressure, and has seen some pressure from customers. It's really around the delay of new product work while they get comfortable around our cybersecurity and data infrastructure or rebuilt. And I characterized it a couple of times you know, it feels like those conversations are moving back towards more normal discussions as they get more comfortable with the seriousness that we are invested -- and large investments we are making in our infrastructure. So, that's kind of the color that we have so far, and the team is working hard as you might imagine, to get those NPIs and other product rollouts in front of customers.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. And I'm sure the answer is no, but I guess there is no way to sort of give us a color on how many customers have just actually gone somewhere else versus continuing conversations with you?","Mark Begor","I think the detail we have given today is what we can provide.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Okay.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Trevor Burns for any additional or closing remarks.","Trevor Burns","I just want to thank everybody for joining the call. I appreciate your time. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8700":["Equifax Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir","Jeff Dodge","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today at www.equifax.com in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in our filings with the SEC including the 2015 Form 10-K and all subsequent filings.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition related amortization expense, as well as the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.","Adjusted EBITDA margin in defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back income tax expense, interest expense net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our Web site. Also, please refer to our investor presentations which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Once again, thank you for joining us for our earnings call. As is normal practice, I will start by giving you some high-level overview on some financials and then with some highlights by the individual business units, come back and give you some insight on the major corporate initiatives, and John will take it from here and go to details on financials, and I'll come back with the summary and then we'll do Q&A.","The second quarter performance continues to reflect outstanding execution across our business units, our verticals in our countries around the world. The team has developed good momentum which should carry us nicely through the remainder of the year and into 2017. Also, our Veda team has continued to deliver the performance that attract us to the company and they fully embrace the integration strategy. I'll give you more on that in a moment. I'm optimistic about the opportunities that the Australian Southeast Asian business will generate for us not just this year, but into the future.","In the quarter, total revenue was $811 million at 20% on reported basis and up 22% on local currency basis from the second quarter of 2015. Organic and constant currency revenue growth accelerated from the first quarter, up very strong at 12%. Also in the quarter, FX equated $17 million of year-over-year headwind. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.6% compared to 35% in the second quarter of 2015, a very solid year-on-year increase. Adjusted EPS was $1.43, up 24% from $1.15 last year and better than our expectations when we got back in April.","I'm now going on to some of the each and individual businesses starting with USIS. 3% revenue growth from the quarter, driven largely by mortgage originations, credit marketing activities, commercial information services and our fraud solutions with an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 50%. Trended data for mortgage industry is expected to go live on September 24. We've been delivering trended data to our customers since April of this year so they could develop familiarity with the contentment and understand the value to their underlying processes. We've already signed agreements with three of the largest mortgage resellers and we'll start billing for these services in August of this year.","Revenue from our credit marketing services product offerings grew up with single digits, driven by double digit growth in both pre-screen and portfolio review offerings. We believe that the majority of this project will focus on new account acquisitions and cross-selling. The growth was also broad-based across all of our major verticals.","The team continues to make very good progress on a commercial information database and solutions. We've been operating under numerous extensions of our agreement with the small business financial exchange. We've been developing an alternative database which we call the commercial financial network. We currently have over 1,200 institutions providing data for the database including some of the largest financial institutions and once again, our commercial business delivered double-digit growth for the quarter.","Our fraud solutions revenue was primarily driven by customer needs to authenticate consumer identity for online access though it was broad-based including financial services, telco, government and our direct-to-consumer resellers. Year-to-date, new product revenue for USIS is ahead of our expectation, driven mostly by non-mortgage lending products and as you know, the NPI pipeline up and running, that bodes well for the next three years.","We continue to expect USIS to deliver growth for the full year at the lower end of the long term range of 5% to 7%. This is the range that we got into for USIS back in February. EBITDA margins are expected to be above 50% for the year, which is slightly better and what we're expecting when we gave you guidance during our first quarter earnings call. On the International, International delivered outstanding 13% local currency organic revenue growth as well above the upper end of their long term range growth model we've talked about which is 8% to 10%. This is driven by broad-based organic initiatives. Total local currency revenue growth of 62% reflects this strong organic growth and the full quarter of revenues from Veda.","Organic revenue growth in International's four largest verticals which are financial institutions, telcos, government and auto accelerated to 18% growth in the quarter, up from 13% growth in the first quarter versus first quarter of the year ago. International decisioning platforms, analytical services and debt management services revenue grew a solid 25% in the quarter, up from 19% in the first quarter. Again, accelerating growth sequentially. Our focus on building powerful insights continues to open new opportunities for customers who operate their businesses more efficiently and effectively.","In the UK, our customer management solutions including loyal customer have enhanced our competitive position and enabled us to continue winning share within the financial institutions. Our UK government contract through TDX is performing well and in-line with our expectations. Initial collections results and anticipated list are consistent with our original expectations and relationships with the departments in the cabinet office remain very strong. We have also made proposals to other government agencies within the UK who are not included in the initial launch. It's still early, we do not expect Brexit to have any material impact on TDX or the UK government initiative.","On Canada, Canada has made great progress in extending our trending data capabilities into the markets and the customers' interest with both large banks and financial institutions has been very strong. Also in Canada, I think we've alluded to this a bit last call, we have recently landed a multi-year, multi-million dollar bill to provide the TDX analytic solutions to one of our largest customers in Canada and that relationship started billing over this month. We're excited about the opportunities in Australia to deliver solid long-term growth for the region. The integration really is going very, very well. Today, there have not been any surprises. In the teams in both Australia and New Zealand are embracing the integration initiatives at all levels of those respective organizations.","During the second quarter we began implementation of our global platforms in Australia. Those including fraud management, analytics, which are Cambrian and the cloud technology. These are very important strategic platforms which we have been investing in for many years, these are the best in class platforms and will provide Veda and our teams down there with tremendous capabilities to develop new products for their markets and customers for years to come. We've also identified a number of opportunities with Veda to both import and export new product ideas from that part of the world to other parts of the world and vice versa.","Finally, the financial performance to date has met all of our expectations and is on track to meet our full-year expectations. International as a whole will have a very strong year of 2016. We expect organic constant currency revenue growth would be above the upper end of the long-term model with the range of 8% to 10% and total growth of 2016 to be over 40% including Veda. EBITDA margins should exit the year comfortably above the second quarter level, which is up nicely as you know versus second quarter of a year ago.","On the Workforce Solutions, they had another outstanding performance in the quarter with 21% revenue growth and a 480 basis point expansion in their EBITDA margin. We continue to add records to the work number database and create valuable insights for our customers. Our success in penetrating key verticals led to strong double-digit growth in auto, consumer finance, government, mortgage, pre-employment and cards. Well, there's more healthcare vertical which is comprised of our income employment verification for CMS and ACA analytics for employers grew almost 200% in the quarter and continues to look very promising moving forward.","Within our compliant center solutions, we've also developed a new series to help employers with the appeal management process under the affordable care. Employers can avoid penalties if they can prove to CMS that their employees were offered conforming affordable care covers for those employees who applied and were approved for subsidies covered through the ACA exchange. During the quarter we also announced the acquisition of Barnet Associates within EWS. This company we've known for a long time is a company with over 33 years of experience and is a nice tuck-in acquisition for EWS. We expect this acquisition to close during the current quarter.","Workforce Solutions in summary will have another outstanding year of 2016 with winning growth substantially above their long-term range of 9% to 11% and adjusted EBITDA margins now in the high 40% range \u2013 just an outstanding stream of growth these guys have been on. Onto what we're used to call, we now call Global Consumer Solutions and delivering 22% local currency revenue growth driven largely by our indirect reseller customers and also that's solid adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter.","Indirect in resell revenue was up over 70%, primarily driven by our relationships, the Credit Karma and LifeLock. Our direct-to-consumer activities continue to deliver revenue and margin consistent with our expectations and Global Consumer Solutions will easily seed the long-term growth target, comfortably delivering strong double-digit growth for the year. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the year that we expected to exceed 30% and when John goes into his discussion, he'll talk about margin in GCS in the second quarter and put some color and texture on that for you.","Back now to the corporate growth initiatives that you've grown familiar with. First is EGI and Enterprise Growth Initiatives which you know we've been out for about seven years now. They're fundamental growth driver to our multi-year growth levels. This year we had eight initiatives in EGI with very specific metrics and milestones with the management team reviews at least on a monthly basis. After six months, we're projecting the full-year revenue from these eight very important growth initiatives and now coming in over 33% above the target we have set at the beginning of the year. That team continues to execute at a very high level.","Cambrian, you've heard us talk about that. It's truly having an amazing impact on how both we and our customers think about the effectiveness of our respective decisioning activities. Our customers were developing tools that enable them to increase approval rates, maintaining overall portfolio loss rates and incorporating more data than just the credit data, we can expand the universe with applicants on which they can render decisions with confidence \u2013 both of which improve marketing effectiveness and contribute incrementally to the revenue growth with very modest increase in expenses for our customers. Internally for Equifax, we use Cambrian to help us better understand the depth and quality with data assets. With these insights, we can identify opportunities to broaden and enhance our data assets as well as specific steps to further improve the quality of our data.","On the NPI, New Product Innovation, is also making strong contributions and once again to our revenue growth. Through June, revenue from these initiatives is running 10% ahead of our expectations for 2016. You might recall that our expectations for third year revenue from our 2016 new product launches was already 130% greater than the 2015 launches third year revenue expectations. So we're ahead coming to the year with very high expectations for the class of products in 2016 and it's already running at least 10% ahead of those expectations.","International Workforce Solutions and USIS are all exceeding expectations with the majority of the USIS growth coming from non-mortgage solutions when you think of new products. The pipeline is healthy and we have a number of launches scheduled for the second half of the year and expect to support that as for revenue growth in 2017 and beyond.","Our outlook for the mortgage market in the US has changed given the recent trends in the yield on 10-year notes and the resulting strength in the activity. Previously we expected mortgage originations for 2016 to be flat despite in down our current view, the mortgage originations will be in the range of now flat to up mid-single digits for the full year and that 10-year treasury stay in the general range that they are now. Obviously if they get weaker, they give us some tailwind. If they rise at fast rate and anticipate it, it might create some headwind at the back end of the year.","Over the years, our annual growth playbook processes has evolved to ensure we maintain an intense-focus on the most critical opportunities that drive revenue growth. This year, we've completed \u2013 it's hard to believe \u2013 our 11th growth in playbook with a focus on individual enterprise-wide, vertical market growth playbooks, develop much deeper insights into our opportunities across all the business units. With these new playbooks, we can better leverage our resources, customer relationships and opportunities to capture incremental revenue growth going forward.","In summary \u2013 before I turn it over to John here \u2013 our strategic initiatives are at or ahead expected as we entered the year. My optimism for both 2016 and 2017 continues to improve as the year unfolds. One comment I want to make and spend a minute on before I give it to John is to put our USIS growth in perspective. A number of you have written about that, you're early reading last night, how we think about that. We view our enterprise-wide vertical market distribution efforts \u2013 you've heard us talk about that \u2013 for a number of years now in the U.S. as is vital to our differentiation and our success in the U.S. marketplace. These vertical markets cut across our U.S. business units, so it's not just credit.","A good way to think about health of our U.S. credit business is to combine as we do, our USIS business with our verification services business and as you know reside in EWS and our healthcare revenues also residing in the EWS. When you think about that enterprise, what products are bringing to the US market, our revenue for the quarter actually grew a very solid 10%, well above the overall growth in our economy and is largely driven by due to product innovation, market penetration and insights. We can talk more about that during the Q&A.","With that, I'll turn it over to John for detailed financials.","John Gamble","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. As a reminder, following to Veda acquisition, we started focusing on adjusted EBITDA margin to more consistently present the operating performance of the segments and the company as a whole. The non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earnings release provides a more-detailed description of what is included in adjusted EBITDA margin. Now let me turn to the business units financial performance for the second quarter.","U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $308 million, up 3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Online information solutions revenue was $220 million, up 2% compared to the year ago period. Total mortgage-related revenue in USIS was up 13% in the quarter. The mortgage bankers application index accelerated late in the quarter, coincident with the drop in the 10-year treasury, ending the quarter of 20%. Revenue mix shifted significantly in the quarter with almost 60% of the USIS mortgage revenue coming through resellers where revenue grew 22%. Financial marketing services revenue was $53 million, up 7% when compared to the year ago quarter. Our commercial business continues to grow nicely up 10% in 2Q and year-to-date. Identity in fraud solutions also continue to grow strongly, up 20% in 2Q and 25% year-to-date.","As you recall, in 4Q '15, we realigned our business units, moving revenue with customers that have only direct-to-consumer relationships with Equifax from USIS to global consumer. During this realignment, customers with broader relationships with Equifax including direct-to-consumer, principally other credit reporting agencies were retained by USIS. USIS revenue in 2Q '16 and first half '16 has been negatively impacted by declines in revenues from these retained direct-to-consumer customers by about 2 percentage points.","The adjusted EBITDA margin for U.S. Information Solutions for 2Q '16 was a very strong 50.4% and up from the 50.1% we've had in the second quarter of 2015. Workforce Solutions revenue was $177 million for the quarter, up 21% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Verification services revenue of $110 million, up 17% continuous to be driven by strong double-digit growth across mortgage, government, auto, pre-employment and card segments. Employer Services revenue of $67 million was up 29% from last year. Again, the traditional Employer Service businesses of unemployment claims, Watsi, I-9 validations and on-boarding reformed well with combined revenue growth consistent with our long term expectations of mid-single digits.","Workforce Analytics which provides services to employers to ensure they are in compliance with the affordable care act grew several hundred percent in 2Q '16. Seasonally, the first half of the year was the highest revenue for Workforce Analytics. This is the period in which employers are required Form 1095-C to employees, a service that Equifax provides. Employer Services revenue in 3Q '16 is expected to grow double digits, but will not be as strong as first half '16, reflecting the seasonal nature of Workforce Analytics revenue.","The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was 50.2%, up from 45.4% in 2Q '15. Seasonally, Workforce Solutions have higher adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half, reflecting seasonality in both Watsi and Workforce Analytics. The adjusted EBITDA margin for Workforce Solutions in 3Q '16 are expected to be up strongly year-to-year, but down sequentially due to the seasonality. Revenue from USIS and Workforce Solutions or total U.S. B2B revenue was $485 million, representing organic growth exceeding 9%.","International's revenue was $290 million, up over 50% on the reported basis and over 60% on a local currency basis. Constant currency organic revenue growth which excludes data revenue was nicely above our long-term range of 8% to 10%. By region, Europe's revenue was $67 million, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 18% local currency. Given the sharp decline in the British pound following the Brexit vote, we anticipate that 3Q '16 Europe revenue measured in U.S. dollars would be negatively impacted by FX by approximately 10%.","Latin America's revenue was $47 million, down 8% in US dollars, but up 14% local currency. The depreciation of the urgency in peso that occurred in Q4 last year represented almost 75% of the FX impact in Latin America. Asia Pacific revenue was $72 million, which is comprised mostly of revenue from Veda. Canada revenue was $32 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency. This was nice growth for Canada and reflects the renewed focus on NPI in Canada we referenced last quarter.","For the second quarter, Internationals adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.4%, up nicely from 25.9% in 2Q '15. We saw a nice growth in the adjusted EBITDA margins in Canada and Europe, as well as benefiting from a full quarter's EBITDA contribution from Veda and Asia Pacific. Global Consumers Solutions revenue was $107 million, up 21% on a reported basis and 22% on a local currency basis. Growth was driven by our direct-to-consumer reseller customers.","For the second quarter, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%, down from 30.6% in 2Q '15. During the second quarter, we had program-related revenue and startup expenses associated with the launching of a relationship with a new customer. Both the program revenue and the startup expenses will not continue into 3Q. As a result, revenue growth in 3Q is still expected to be double digit, but will be below the level generated in 2Q. Also as a result, adjusted EBITDA margin will improve significantly in the third quarter and for the remainder of the year.","In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $46 million. Excluding Veda integration expense, 2Q '16 general corporate expense was $44 million. 2Q '16 was down from 1Q '16 as in the first quarter, executive equity comp is issued with the bulk of the expense in the period. 2Q '16 corporate expense was lower than expected as total employee bonuses accrued in the period were as expected, but more of the bonuses were incurred in the business units than in corporate. Also, some corporate investments expected to be incurred in 2Q '16 were delayed. For the third and fourth quarters, we expect general corporate expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, reflecting higher levels of corporate investments.","The adjusted EBITDA margin for Equifax was 36.6%, up from 35% in 2015. The strength in adjusted EBITDA margins in 2Q '16 reflect the very strong adjusted EBITDA margins and Workforce Solutions, International and USIS as well as lower corporate expenses. We expect the 3Q '16 EBITDA margin to decrease sequentially, but increase year-to-year at a rate slightly lower than our expectations for full-year improvement. We expect our full year 2016 EBITDA margin to be up about 75 basis points from the 34.7% we achieved in 2015.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34%, which was slightly above our expectations due to unfavorable discreet items. Our expectation is that the full-year 2016 effective tax rate will be just under 33%, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, the effective tax rate will be below the full year rate. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million and year-to-date are $83 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be at approximately 6% of revenue, which is at the high-end of our long-term range reflecting investments made related to Veda integration.","Year-to-date, operating cash flow remains strong at $280 million and consistent with our expectations. The slight decline from first half '15 is principally due to changes of working capital. Total debt in the quarter was $2.95 billion. During the quarter, we issued $775 million of five and 10-year notes that refinanced the 364-day credit facility used to finance the acquisition of Veda. As we indicated last quarter, we have suspended our share repurchase program and we will focus on debt reduction until we return credit metrics to a level consistent with our current credit ratings. We are continuing with the acquisitions and in the quarter announced the acquisition of Barnet Associates as Rick referenced earlier.","With regards to the Veda acquisition, integration continues to go well and we continues to expect 2016 revenue from Veda to be $230 million to $235 million, with adjusted EPS accretion from Veda at approximately $0.20 share.","Now, let me turn it back to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks, John. Quick summary before we go to Q&A. The guidance looking forward to the third quarter, we're increasing our outlook for both revenue and adjusted EPS. We now expect revenue to be between $795 million and $805 million, reflecting constant currency revenue growth between 22% and 24%. This partially offset by 3 points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36 for the quarter which is up 17% to 19%. Excluding $0.03 per share negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency EPS growth for the third quarter of 19% to 22%.","With our strong second quarter performance and our strong outlook for the third quarter, we're also increasing our full-year outlook. For the full year, we expect revenue to now be between $3.13 billion and $3.16 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 20% to 22%, partially offset again by 3 points of FX headwind. This is an improvement from the previous guidance we provided you, which was $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion and increases our confidence we will end the year nicely above the high end of a multi-year model of 6% to 8% of organic revenue growth.","From a revenue perspective, 2016, I think you'd agree, they're shifting up nicely. Constant currency, organic revenue growth, 11% in the first quarter accelerated to 12% in the second quarter and we're holding in the range of 11% to 13% in the second half that gives two years of double-digit constant currency organic revenue growth. This will also -- as you might guess -- give us good momentum as we go into 2017.","Adjusted EPS for the year is expected to be now between $5.35 and $5.40, which is up 19% to 20% excluding approximately $0.12 per share for the full-year of negative impact from the FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth for the year of 22% to 23%. This, too is up from the $5.15 to $5.25 we got to during our first quarter earnings call and as John alluded to, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by 75 basis points as we did got into earlier for the full year of 2016.","With that, operator, we'd like to open up the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from David Togut of Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thank you. Congrats on the second quarter outperformance and the lift in the 2016 outlook.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","David Togut","Rick, I was glad to hear the upgrade in your outlook for the mortgage market this year. I'm wondering more broadly, are the lower interest rates we're seeing in the U.S. and globally driving an increase in consumer credit demand more broadly as well? For example auto, mortgage and other key drivers?","Rick Smith","Yes. We're seeing good strength in the U.S. in auto, in car and in mortgage and obviously beyond that, which is not really influenced by interest rates. Great strength in the debt management and analytics platform. We're talking about TDX, we got a nice win in Canada that we just announced. Broadly speaking, the interest rate environment in the U.S., I think is healthy for the U.S. consumer. We're not seeing dramatic changes quarter-to-quarter, David, but just good strength.","David Togut","Got it. And then sorry if I missed it, but did you call out the number of active work number records as of the end of Q2? And as a related question, what are you seeing trend-wise in terms of hit ratio and Workforce Solutions?","Rick Smith","Two great questions. I did not call it out. We are well on the path we can do to get to a number of 300 million total records. We focus on total records, there are so much value in historical, not just the active with that and with other things that we're used doing -- the hit rate across EWS on the work number continues to rise really solid.","David Togut","Understood. And then just a quick final question, it was great to see the 480 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion in Workforce Solutions. How much operating leverage is left in this business over the next two to three years and what do you see as the ceiling on margins?","Rick Smith","We've kind of guided long-term model EWS from the 50% range, below 50s and I think we'll get there. It is remarkable, David, and you've done, too during analysis. When you look at the rate of increase in the EBITDA margins over the past five years, it's a beauty that not only incremental margins are high. Yes, we expect that being the low 50% range moving forward which is extremely healthy.","David Togut","As just finally, as Workforce Solutions becomes a bigger part of Equifax's total profit pool, how do you think about capital allocation across the businesses over time?","Rick Smith","We continue to invest heavily, we head along with forcing it because we've remodeled and have the ability to investment significantly in growth businesses. We have invested heavily in EWS over the year's corp structure products, new products, new platforms and will continue to do so. When I think about a long-term horizon data, all EWS in the next horizon for them which we're working upon now, is taking it to global markets, taking our exchange technology platforms or products that requires capital investment so we have the wherewithal, the ability to invest in those countries to create the vision we have for EWS, which is a truly global enterprise over the next 10 years.","David Togut","Understood. Thank you very much.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move next to Manav Patnaik of Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually Greg calling out for Manav. Just wanted to ask about USIS and the bridge to the low end of 5% to 7% for the full year. I think it was about 3% in the first half. So, just wondering what's driving the acceleration? I think you've got mortgage and the Fanny Mae contract, but any other things we should be thinking about?","Rick Smith","There are two things and Jeff, John, you jump in if you want to this. It's the point that John had made and it's the third time, I think is important before I get to the acceleration if I may. I wanted to be thinking of 3% or 3.-something. Just 3.-something the first quarter and 3.-something the second quarter. As John alluded to, we made a restructuring of our peso business, peso business, now called GCS in the last year, firstly this year. We left behind some traditional relationships that do the same thing \u2013 sell these products, but not to Credit Karma and LifeLock. We left that behind with USIS, took them easily and moved that whole thing over to the peso.","The [indiscernible] behind is a shrinking business as you know and with that came about 2 points of headwind. Think about the health of the core USIS business, it actually grew with tough comps year-on-year because of mortgage last year actually grew when you adjust that direct-to-consumer business over 5% baseline. Now when you think of the acceleration going into second half of the year, it's really NPI and part of the NPI you alluded to was quite a data for Fannie Mae. But it's NPI generically. The total also then aided by the trended data for Fannie Mae.","John Gamble","And very good continued performance expected in marketing services, in commercial, in identity in frauds. Those businesses that are growing very well are expected to continue to accelerate, drives the whole thing up.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, helpful. And then the other one for me would be on M&A, maybe a little detail on how Barnet Associates fits in with EWS and then more broadly, how the pipeline that we should expect further deals in the back half of the year? Thanks.","Rick Smith","Thank you, Greg. Yes. Barnet, we've known for a long, long time. It might be 20 years plus and in his time, when he ran the business, Greg, and even before him Bill Canfield, established really good relationships with the owners of the company over the last four or five years and we're just getting to know them well. That's our philosophy we're close to doing deals, is to get to know the cultures of products opportunities. We've done that here. It's a small deal, but it's a nice deal. There are many EWS. They do everything. There's the synergies for us there and I think as I said, by time is we should close that in August.","As far as the pipeline, it continues to be healthy and we did not include any other acquisitions in the guidance that we provided you. We continue to be very thoughtful, obviously driven by the strategy as to what we'll acquire, but we have the capacity, and the pipeline, and the ability to do more acquisitions this year if it makes sense.","Operator","Otto Garrett of Deutsche Bank have our next question.","Otto Garrett","Congrats on the strong quarter and increased guidance. Just one more question on auto and market. I know you guys called out some very strong results there, but just given the fact that we're seeing declining auto sales, or the seller, not a sale, I should say this year. Just go through and say how dependent is that business on the strong auto sales volume and how you're able to get some strong growth despite those trends?","Rick Smith","One, obviously a growing market helps all and we are benefactor if the market itself is gone. Having said that, our forecast calls \u2013 and I don't know the exact numbers \u2013 but largely calls over the next X number of years, a moderation in growth in new and used car sales and we're talking in the U.S. So we don't expect the dramatic uptake from the market than we've seen post global recession to-date. Having said that, we are relatively under penetrated in auto. Number two, we have gotten great new products and we have been launching that help us penetrate the auto market. Within the penetration, a long [ph] we left still is the use of our award-number records to validate, verify and plug the net income. So that will fuel automotive growth for a number of quarters or years to come.","Otto Garrett","Great. And also looking at the global consumer solution, you mentioned that you're getting some strong growth in your indirect channels in that. Can you just give us your comments or thoughts on some of the long-term agreements that some of your competitors are in that space or some of the transactions that have happened in that space? Thanks.","Rick Smith","Sure. When we think of partners out there \u2013 I'll come back to that -- very, very nice and important good part of those that we had is a business called TrustedID who have got a variety of partners. You heard us talking about over the years and those continue to grow nicely. Specific to Credit Karma as you know, we had a contract with Credit Karma. That contract is far as the end of this year. This Karma practice with any good customer that we deal with. It's in both of our best interest to negotiate these contracts well before expiration. We have the teams doing that now. But beyond just that, we're looking really to enhance the partnership to add value to Credit Karma and that value would be through things like insights that we provide, the unique assets that we have and interest in partnering with them are what makes sense in countries around the world where we got very strong sizable platforms to help them expand their revenue streams beyond just the U.S.","All of those are being intertwined as you might guess into the discussion of a contract negotiation and we remain very, very confident that the good resolution to the contract is Credit Karma.","Otto Garrett","Okay. One last one. Just wondering if you have any updates on your contract with the Social Security Administration in terms of your fraud identity authentication revenue?","Rick Smith","They're doing so well. It's still early.","Otto Garrett","Great. Thank you.","Rick Smith","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll move next to Ramsey [ph] of Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys. Great quarter. I wanted to ask you about the international margin expansion. They're very solid this quarter. Is this just a question of increasing operating leverages you scale in global markets? Are there other mix-related impacts? Are there other leverage you can work in order to get the margin going internationally?","Rick Smith","I'll start and John, please jump in. It is consistent with the expectation when we gave you the multi-year guidance for margins for Internationals. First and foremost, no surprises at all. There are a couple of things I think about \u2013 John, you may have a couple more that I'd miss \u2013 that are coming together to aid that margin increase. Number one, you may recall sometime in 2015, we announced some restructuring, some recent innovation across the international marketplace. We did greater scale. That was an investment, we're now yielding some benefits. Number two, we talked about the government contract for debt management analytics in the UK who have investments in the cash in the revenue, you're now getting revenue. And number three is what our model is, just incremental margin. As you grow [ph], margin expands. Number four is as you know, we bought Veda. Veda had margins. We announced the acquisition and that were accreted for the international margins and now staying on focus. I think those four things are the vast majority. John, you know some?","John Gamble","Those are the biggest areas and we're also globalizing platforms which allows you to reduce your cost more rapidly. Yes.","Rick Smith","That's a great point. As we deployed these global platforms around the world, over the next X number of years, you should continue to see some margin enhancement from International.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that makes sense. Did the small tuck-in Barnet, will that add an impact? Can you parse out the impact on the year in terms of revenue EPS?","Rick Smith","It's small, Ramsay. It's nice for us. At the corporate level, it's very small this year because in August you'll have less than half a year of revenue. But we've got some great finance for percentages in growth as we take that asset under our wings for 2017 and beyond.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, terrific. Thanks a lot, guys.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Operator","And Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley has our next question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. This is Patrick in for Toni. I wanted to ask about global consumer growth because obviously, very robust this quarter, but remains well above 5% to 8% multi-organic growth framework you've talked about in the past. Do you have any sense of that market for providing consumers with credit scores on personal finance websites, credit card statements, et cetera? Is it becoming increasingly saturated?","Rick Smith","It will become saturated at some point in time. We don't see any signs and we'll start the U.S. first. There isn't any signs that there's a saturation of that marketplace yet in the U.S. and having said that, you also know that we directly and indirectly \u2013 who partners [ph] questions is taken that capability to other markets around the world. Our global consumer in GCS business is truly global. So if there's a need and opportunity for us, we and our partners will directly build those pricing capabilities in other parts of the world, we're going to do so.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. And then I wanted to ask about potential investments in alternative data. I know you're getting data from telecom and utility companies now. But I wanted to ask about that from an M&A and then OpEx perspective going forward?","Rick Smith","We have under Ray Lockers [ph] leadership we have got Annie [ph] who runs data analytics in marketing for us, have a data team. They are very capable team and their team is coming back to our strategy. As you might guessed, Patrick, if you look at each country around the world, as you look at every vertical around the world, there's a strategy that says where are we playing our data capabilities? Where are the gaps in data capabilities? What is the process to fill those gaps? Is it to partner or is it to buy? That's a continual focus we have. That granular level of detail around the world.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then lastly I do want to ask about growth in peer-to-peer lending in marketplaces over the last number of years and it's sort of a longer term question. But do you anticipate any impact from that trend, disintermediation on the USIS business over the long term?","Rick Smith","I do not. I think obviously the marketplace is adjusting a bit. You can see challenges ahead of as you know. They're customers of ours, they buy our credit data as you know, they buy our employment data, they buy our income data, they buy some fraud data. They're good customers of ours. I don't know, but if I'd make a guess, I think in the future, if you think about that remote on secured lending, which you call peer-to-peer lending, it would surprise me if those become really part of banking capabilities as opposed individual entities.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks, Rick. Congratulations on the quarter, everyone.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move next to Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company.","Tim McHugh","Yes, thanks. Can I ask if you can help size, I guess what part of USIS at this point that said direct-to-consumer piece though that's declining and is that a business meant longer term decline? Should we just try and think about how much of a medium-term drag we should think about that being on the piece of the business?","Rick Smith","Yes, Tim, maybe. Back some time in 2015, I can't recall, John, we've talked about what the world might look like direct-to-consumer business and we said that that business would be the low-growth, lowest single digit growth, maybe even decline. But the other partners and some so forth are trustworthy business. So within USIS, to be very specific, John, to find that for, if you take the USIS business, that PPC revenue created 2 points of headwind for USIS in the first half of the year. You can reverse, do the math yourself. I don't have it up on my head. You can do that math -- how large the revenue decline rate on that basis [ph].","John Gamble","But it's not a large business for us. No. But it did decline materially in the quarter.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And then for USIS, you didn't really change the revenue outlook, but you said you feel better about where margins lined up for this year. I guess what changed if you look at the piece?","Rick Smith","Just clarification on the revenue outlook, we didn't change it which is prior to guidance. Sequentially, it's going to go from three point something until a total year up, about 5% growth. So you have much higher growth in the second half of the year over the USIS and with that comes obviously margins, incremental margin in the USIS is significant. Growth acceleration in margin grows with it.","Tim McHugh","Okay, but your full-year guidance, I guess wasn't any different than before, what you said your full-year margin guidance was different?","Rick Smith","We said slightly higher.","Tim McHugh","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Operator","And we'll move next to Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys, good morning. This is Anthony [ph] for Gary. Congratulations on the quarter again and I guess just thinking longer term, I think you mentioned that 2016 NPI is running 10% above planned for June. Any insight that was driving that? It would be kind of greater market potential that you guys are seeing, or penetration, or new adjacent market that somebody's products came? Do you have any use by or what is driving that?","Rick Smith","I think it's a couple of things, Kyle. I think you may recall \u2013 I can't remember what the heck it was now, but we launched this thing called Innovation 2.0 maybe late '14 and that was a catalyst. Just when you think about integration, we think about NPI, also focused on how we become better at executing and we launched products at the time, the revenue is better. It was a big focus as well. The other thing you can recall, we've launched this capability called Cambrian. There's a lot of this that build products in a fraction of time. It used to take us to build products, modify products to the customer's needs. The combination of Innovation 2.0, higher level execution which means build and launch, we actually get the word sooner and faster and then the third element is Cambrian. Those three, you're seeing an alteration of those three now result in greater confidence in our revenue outlook for NPI to the point that it was just not NPI [ph], but was the growth coming out of our enterprise growth initiatives, which is substantially higher than one we thought and also the last year. Our team is actually very high-level as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks. I guess on a similar front, the International organic growth among some of the key verticals you pointed out accelerated pretty strong in there in the second quarter. I guess are there particular markets within those verticals, particular products that you guys are seeing particular strength or little more in there [ph]?","Rick Smith","Kyle, the rewarding aspect is it is so broad-based. I think I mentioned a number of verticals International, but sequentially was stronger in the second quarter versus first quarter and if you broke that down like country by vertical, you see similar things. It's not that it's being driven by one vertical, one country should broad-based countries and verticals. That's largely due to the fact that the focus we launched a number of years ago to become experts in different verticals that were important to our long-term growth, but the resources the data assets, the technology platforms, the analytics focus on those verticals to drive growth and we're seeing as it continued benefit of that focus.","Unidentified Analyst","Great, thanks.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Operator","And Jeff Mueler of Baird have our next question.","Jeff Mueler","Yes, thank you. Can you talk about the employer services, new product pipeline? Obviously WSA is red-hot right now, but can you just talk about the pipeline and anything about that product development process in terms of how it's maybe similar versus different to developing products in your other businesses given that I think there's more of a BPO element to a lot of the products?","Rick Smith","How should I tackle that? I'd say the process are the same. NPI, it doesn't matter what you're doing, it's rigorous to process and we've been at it now for 10 years. That applied as much too. We are not developing a lot of products to be very explicit, any WSA, BPO products. You don't get that kind of margin enhances we're getting in EWS to 400 basis points, which we said was over 50% total EBITDA margin, those are SaaS products. We talk about in the last couple of calls, this contract of compliance center and it's really the products underneath compliance center that Dan has started building out, now Marie is building out. Think of those as SaaS products largely; I-9 would be an example, ACA would be an example and others. But the staff margin as you know is a great revenue model, highly recurring revenue margin. So think about that, no differently you think about the rest of the Equifax as we think about new products.","John Gamble","The largest is users has substantial investment there to make.","Rick Smith","John, you said it great. Thanks. A big, big piece of employer service is part of EWS as you probably know, Jeff, is in our employment claims business and the team is investing heavily in moving that to a SaaS product as well, which if you think of the next five or ten years in the margin enhancement, you're getting, converting a model on these business to more of a SaaS product, that's huge margin.","Jeff Mueler","Okay. And then super scores. How big of a business is that for you today? Are we at the early stages of it?","Rick Smith","In the scheme of things, if you think of a major growth leverage we have in the genre, primarily is day-in day-out, super scores is not one of them.","Jeff Mueler","Okay and then just finally I guess specific to Credit Karma, is it reasonable to assume that since you were the second in terms of order, time, data, provider to that relationship, that maybe you came in at a lower price, so as price gets reset every through your competitor that you would theoretically have lots to lose in terms of potential pricing adjustment?","Rick Smith","Jeff in particular time, but know this -- and I think you know this well enough now, our philosophy, we think about the relationships. Probably if you continue to add, you unique value and insights that make their business better, that make their revenue stronger, that make their profit stronger \u2013 if we could do things about leveraging capabilities that we have that are unique to us about the employment data, the income data, some fraud data, Cambrian, I think I've mentioned in my comments earlier, helping them get that we are in and we are very significant players is a way to make their business better, stronger \u2013 you wrap all those things together as we've done over the years, you tend to move away from price discussion or the value discussion. But they are very, very good customers. I'd say even more than customer, a partner of ours and the attitude is along the lines that you just describe and that's value creation for both sides.","Jeff Mueler","Good. Thank you. Great quarter.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll move to Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, Rick. I know Equifax has many current strong growth drivers. I do want to ask more about the trended credit data specifically the Fannie Mae initiative and how much that might add to Equifax revenues by fourth quarter of this year? Our team calculated about 1.2% for that, thinking about the price increases that only go to Fannie Mae loans, but maybe that's too low. Could I think, I understand now, that the trended data price increases are also going to do it to Freddie loans as well?","Rick Smith","I'm going to start the latter piece and I'll come to the first piece. What you're saying at current with the support of Fannie Mae making this standard for all loans securitize through them, they turned, we're saying merging is the only product being offered to the marketplace going forward. The mortgage will be a product that has data that has been trended. Freddie does not have the technical capabilities yet to consume, they turn the data. It's our understanding, they're highly interested in doing so, but being very clear, the product we're going to offer to the mortgage market in the U.S. is trended product only. That comes at a different price point than in the past when it started. You're pretty smart, you got ways to think about that, look at your number. I'm not going to disclose that here.","Andrew Steinerman","Right. I understand the reason that price increased, but you do admit that when you add it all up, it's over a point of additional revenue for Equifax. Right?","Rick Smith","You're good, Andrew. Yes, it will go to all of the resellers and our direct customers as well. We just not here to disclose. You know this, you've been a witness a long time. Wherever we could add value to a customer \u2013 in this case the mortgage market, make underlying decisions better and we can add value from our product, in this case trended and charge more for that. We've done that for years. We're always about trying to create value to our customers and I think trended data, we know for a fact as mortgages, we had investments and resources behind that, there's also the higher price. That's no different than what we've been doing for 10 years. It just happened to be a little different product because there's a trended element to it, but we're not going to disclose that percentage.","Andrew Steinerman","All right. Thanks for the try. I appreciate it.","Rick Smith","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","And Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel has our next question.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in here.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Rick, could you remind us where we are in terms of getting ACA clients to contribute more of the employment records to the work number database? You mentioned in the past that for the start, defaulting there, are that just happening in their contracts and are you actively working on migrating that?","Rick Smith","Great question, Shlomo. I think we've talked about this generically before its ready and maybe a quarter or so ago. Think about what had to be done and number one was a technology-built that enabled a client when they signed up for ACA to seamlessly forward the data from the ACA database, into the work number database. That work was launched earlier this year and I believe went live in June, July. Guys, am I that right? June or July? Okay. So June or July, it is now out and warming today. If you check on the slides, one will think about is two buckets of customers. There are customers who have already been clients of ACA and there are new guys who will sign up for ACA. The new ones are easy. You sign them up, it ports over to the work number database. The team and I are going back to those times who have previously been customers of ACA and working with them. Now they're porting their data from ACA into the work number. Yes, we're adding records and have been adding records for at least a month or so to the work number database out of ACA.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Are the customers amenable to that? In other words, the old customers, the relatively old customers there amenable to going back and actively putting it on this platform?","Rick Smith","Yes. There's almost virtually no work required from them as well. Existing customers will be clients of ACA in the last years, yes are amenable to becoming to contributors to work number database. That's a process we put them through to make sure they're clearly aware of that population of the work number database.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, thanks. And then John, in terms of second half free cash flows, we see some of those working capital items like really reversed? To have a pretty strong second half, or is there something going on that is going to make this just somewhat of a lower free cash flow year in general?","John Gamble","The working capital items that affected the first half are really specific in the first half. So you should see better working capital performance in the second half. CapEx is up this year, so you're going to see that impact year-on-year, but in terms of operating cash flow before free cash flow, the working capital items should reverse.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then I hate to beat this horse again, but can you just give us an on-the-ground description of the part of the business that was retained in USIS that is shrinking? Are other euros are selling your scores, or you're selling their scores? I'm just trying to understand exactly what it is that's shrinking over there.","Rick Smith","Yes. John have described it fairly well, you just hit it on the head and that is other players in marketplace and we've got extensive relationships with including PPC, so the other bureaus as you call have them and are buying those products they sell in the PPC marketplace. Because of the free marketplace, it's growing their business. The bureau's business is shrinking. When that shrinks, the USIS revenue shrinks. Okay? Thanks.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Yes, it does, but your own direct-to-consumer, is that business that we stable?","Rick Smith","Repeat?","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Yes. Where you guys have your own subscription-based business that I go up there on Equifax.com and sign myself up per month or something like that?","Rick Smith","It's flat.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Flat? Okay. All right, very good. Thank you.","Rick Smith","Thank you, Shlomo.","Operator","And Oscar Turner of SunTrust have our next question.","Oscar Turner","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Rick Smith","Sure.","Oscar Turner","So you talked about the importance of your enterprise-wide vertical focus distribution strategy. Which verticals do you view as having the most wide space? Maybe both in the U.S. and then also international, and then also would it make sense to start reporting your business based on verticals?","Rick Smith","I'll answer that last piece first and I'll go to the first piece. I'm a firm believer by verticals. They just have [indiscernible]. We have verticals focuses across the globe however which gives the domain expertise and the ability to invest specifically on products and technology and most of them \u2013 I don't see a time, Oscar, in the near future where that means or several years where you report at a vertical. That does not mean we're not running full speed around verticals. Having said that, we'll remain verticals as John -- that I think about the next five years, global will add a lot of excitement and energy for long-term growth. Obviously fraud prevention and identity management would be one. The government is another around the world. There are some really cool things in U.S. as you know, around government.","The debt management platform in UK is government, so government is going to be a continued big growth there. Of course healthcare is I think when you talk about growing almost 200% in the second quarter would be another one. There's the traditional ones you always think about us, you under-penetrated auto, but growing nicely. Financial services are all of the important...","John Gamble","Commercials and opportunities.","Rick Smith","Commercials and opportunity. We've talked about, Oscar, with the early days, if your horizons are like ours, which is five to ten years, was like bringing our exchange capability and product capability from EWS on the world and opening up a whole new realm of growth opportunities there would be another.","Oscar Turner","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then you mentioned government being a focus, but just looking at the UK government bill, can you provide more color on the status of that deal? What's the volume in the database and also how should we think about the timing of the revenue growth ramp?","Rick Smith","Revenue is coming through nicely. It's high expectations and relationships are fabulous. They give us \u2013 you know hard to believe with pounds and they give us something about \u00a31 billion of debt. We've now analyzed and replaced things. At the expected level when we launched this thing, almost under any dimension you can think of for the management and complicated frauds like the UK debt management analytics platform, it's at or ahead our expectations. It's really going well. And as we talked about before, I hope they give us credibility, it's starting to yield right now in the other arms of the UK government to help build more revenue streams than we have today and take that product capability, once it's a certain point and bringing other countries as well and help other governments on the world solve the same problem.","Oscar Turner","Okay, thank you.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Brett Huff of Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Rick Smith","Sure, Brett.","Brett Huff","Just one sort of housekeeping thing and then one general question. On the housekeeping side, I don't want to beat the Barnet thing to death, but your guidance raise was substantially above your 2Q beat and I just want to make sure how much of that guidance raise was sort of fundamental or organic and how much of it was from Barnet? I know you said it was small. I just want to make sure I understand that magnitude.","Rick Smith","Good question. Thank you for the clarification. Zero is associated to the Barnet acquisition.","Brett Huff","Okay, that's helpful. And then in mortgage, I recall when mortgage is good and you're selling a lot of 3-in-1s, that's a low-margin business. Did you see negative impact from that in the quarter on the percentage margin?","John Gamble","What we saw on the quarter actually is a shift in our mortgage business for resellers, which is much higher margins. It's less revenue generation, but the margin is substantially higher.","Rick Smith","Just one point of clarification that -- just try towards lower, it's still exceptional margin at the end of the business.","Brett Huff","Okay. That's all I needed. Thank you.","Rick Smith","Thank you, Brett.","Rick Smith","Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their time and interest.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge with Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2011 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will refer to a non-GAAP financial measure adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation in our various investor presentations posted in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab on our website for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our team posted yet another really strong performance in the third quarter. Our strong performance, again, reflects the breadth and the balance of our business model. Our customers increasingly value unique products and services we offer, and our team is always focused on driving sustainable organic revenue growth in what is a challenging economic times. Strength in the mortgage refinancing activity aided our results as well, but we're also seeing, for the first time, strength across the new home sales in the U.S., which is encouraging and, I think, bodes well going forward.","Even in our mortgage offerings, just as in the rest of the company, we're also gaining market share through introduction of new products and increased share of wallet from enhanced service delivery.","For the quarter, our core organic growth, including growth initiatives, was 7.2%, which is in the middle of our long-term organic growth range that we've communicated for quite some time now, being between 6% and 8%, so solid on the organic growth.","For the quarter, revenue was $544 million, up 11% in the third quarter of 2011. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up 12%, which is above the range we gave during our second quarter call.","Operating margin was 24.3% compared to 24.8% in 2011. When you exclude severance expenses in our International business, which was not anticipated at the time we gave our guidance for the third quarter, the operating margin was 25%. Finally, adjusted EPS was $0.75 a share, up 16% from the $0.65 we delivered last year.","And we transition quickly to each of the business units. Each of the business units continued to successfully address the needs of the markets with high-valued solutions. We've adopted our new product innovation, strengthened our strategic initiatives, streamlined our operation and strengthened our management teams to ensure we meet our commitments to both our customers and our shareholders, and the team continues to execute at very high levels across the board. It's been a constant theme now for the last couple of years.","Strong double-digit growth in USCIS was broad based. In addition to new relationships we developed in leveraging our unique data assets and our proprietary technology. We continue to compete based upon our track record of product innovation to secure long-term relationships and greater penetration, and do customers' business activities.","As an example, continuing our success in the insurance arena, we won a new multi-year deal with over $5 million. We've become more, more bullish in the U.S. around the insurance sector for our long-term growth.","In our traditional financial institution sector, we have been selected by a top bank, top 4 banks in the country, for a multi-year agreement to provide data for an enterprise-wide database platform to support their analytic and modeling development activities. This project will leverage many of our unique data assets, our proprietary data linking technology and many of our Decision 360 product offerings. This is really exciting. This will allow us to get in there and co-develop with our customers new products to solve new problems for them in the future and financially, very, very lucrative for us.","Sticking with USCIS, we continue to have great success with our proprietary ID and fraud management solutions, including Anakam's two-factor authentication solution. We signed 3 different contracts with the U.S. government in the quarter, and these 3 contracts represent over $5.5 million in first year revenue.","Moving onto International. In spite of a challenging economy in Europe, which I think you all are very well aware of, and a modestly declining or slowing economy in Latin America, the International delivered solid growth. 7% organic growth in Europe and 9% organic growth in Latin America. So really troubled economies, as you know, in Europe and to post those kind of growth rates is very encouraging.","Operating margins remain very strong as they continue to systematically leverage a consistent set of operating principles across all of our geographies, introduce new products and enter new markets.","International routinely develops and introduces new high-value solutions into the markets as reflected in their NPI Vitality Index, which was 11% of total revenue for the third quarter. In the U.K., we leverage our InterConnect platform in a head-to-head competition to win a new large telco customer.","Finally, revenue continues to be driven by the growth of over 20% in our high-value Technology and Analytical Services offerings. Our Technology and Analytical Services growth rate in International has been fantastic in the last couple of years and leads the way globally at 20%.","Workforce Solutions continues to make great progress in growing its actively employed Work Number database while broadening its service -- served verification markets and further enhancing relationships with the HR departments who report into The Work Number database.","Active records in The Work Number database were up 6% year-over-year as a result of adding a record 161 new companies and the increased hirings from our existing contributors. Great traction there.","Earlier this year, we launched an enterprise-wide go-to-market initiative, leveraging our USCIS sales force to increase the penetration of all Equifax products with our client base, including The Work Number. To date, this initiative has generated almost 3 times the revenue growth target we set for verification services. So already this team is gaining great traction and leveraging all of our products with a very aggressive focus on The Work Number.","We were recently awarded 2 multi-year contracts to provide Social Services Verifications. The first contract includes verification services for a state's food stamp, welfare and child support enforcement, and Medicaid eligibility services. The other contract provides verification services to an agency of the federal government for disaster loan eligibility. These are both excellent examples to how we enter new markets with new services leveraging our existing data assets and operational infrastructures. In this case, The Work Number.","Finally, the IRS has selected Workforce Solutions as its first pilot vendor to deliver eTranscript. The service is designed to streamline the process of delivering 4506-T information to verifiers in real time at the request of the taxpayer, enhancing the time lists and the value of our services.","Moving onto North American PSol. They continue to drive strong revenue growth and above-expected operating margins. PSol has developed a very good operating rhythm with metrics that are reported and evaluated real time every day. They focus intently on growing the subscription -- the subscriber base, increasing ARPU, managing churn and reducing our cost per account acquired. As a result, our subscription-based revenue has now reached 68% of our total revenue and margins continue to be very strong.","North American Commercial Solutions continues to be challenged by weak demand from many of its project-oriented services, particularly in the marketing area. As we indicated last quarter, this trend is likely to continue in the near term as banks and other financial institutions pull back on its small business lending activity. However, the risk side of the business continues to be very strong, which we will get into in a few minutes.","For many years now, we've been executing consistently on our strategic plan, accumulating a diverse portfolio of data assets, mine the mass of data, and extracting relevant insights through sophisticated analytics and delivering our solutions to proprietary decisioning platforms.","Increasingly, our customers are recognizing the true value we can bring to their daily business operations. In short, we are winning market share and growing revenue nicely as a result.","As you've seen over the course of the year, our solid year-to-date performance demonstrates the effectiveness of our business model and our strategy in a more volatile competitive environment and how rigorous operating principles underpin the consistency of our business performance. So in short, another really solid quarter seen in this third quarter.","Lee, if you go to the financials now, that'd be great.","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will be referring to the financial results generally presented on a GAAP basis. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.","As our customers' environments evolve, we continue to drive revenue growth by addressing their needs with a unique combination of data, analytics and decisioning technology. Our performance this quarter was broad based and ahead of the expectations we set as we entered the quarter.","Compared to the same quarter of 2011, for the third quarter of 2012, consolidated revenue of $544 million was up 11% on a reported basis. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue was up 12%. Operating margins was 24.3% compared to 24.8% for the third quarter in 2011. In the quarter, our International business unit recorded a severance charge, which we had not previously planned, to better align its resources with our future business needs. When you exclude the severance expense, the operating margin is 25.0%.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.64 a share. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $0.75, up 16% from $0.65 in the third quarter of 2011.","As I noted, the quarter included $3.7 million before tax or $2.4 million after-tax of severance expense in our International business unit. We also benefited by $3.3 million from income tax benefits. Neither of these 2 items was anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The net impact of these 2 items added just under $0.01 to earnings per share.","Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 15% year-over-year. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was up -- was $157 million, up 16%. Third quarter online volume was up 5%, driven primarily by continued growth in credit card, auto and mortgage lending. Average revenue per transaction was up 4% in the quarter, driven by a shift in mix of volume.","Our remaining growth came from services beyond traditional credit reports, including direct-to-consumer monitoring services and new product offerings priced on a subscription basis.","Mortgage Solutions revenue of $43 million was up 35% compared to Q3 2011. Both mortgage reporting and settlement services delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter.","Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $33 million, down 4%. Credit Marketing Services revenue was up approximately 7%, while IXI declined as revenue -- as financial institutions reduced their use of wealth-based data in select applications due to regulatory uncertainty that we are currently addressing.","The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 36.9%, up from 36.6% in the third quarter a year ago.","Our International business units revenue was $121 million, up 2% on a reported basis and 6% on a constant dollar basis. By region, Latin America's revenue was $47 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency.","Strong double-digit growth in Technology and Analytical Services is offset by softness in marketing services and Personal Solutions.","Chile recently passed legislation that changed the permissible use of consumer information, having a negative short-term impact on our revenue in that country. We are implementing some mitigating initiatives, but the near-term pressure in revenue growth in Chile will continue.","Europe's revenue was $42 million, up 3% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. Strong double-digit growth in Analytical Services and Personal Solutions helped to offset a decline in our consumer and commercial information segments, which were impacted by the generally weaker economic conditions.","Canada consumer information revenue was $33 million, flat in U.S. dollars and up 1% in local currency. Strength in Technology and Analytical Services, particularly in fraud services, offset weakness in Consumer and Commercial Information Solutions.","International's operating margin was 27.4%, down from 29.3% in 2011. Excluding the severance charge mentioned earlier, the operating margin would have been 30.4% in line with past quarter's performance. For the quarter, Workforce Solutions revenue was $117 million for the quarter, up 14%.","Verification services, with revenue of $69 million was up 33% for the quarter, approximately 80% of our growth was organic and broad based, with strong double-digit growth in mortgage, consumer finance, preemployment and government uses of verification services. The remaining in organic growth resulted from the acquisition of DataVision in August of 2011.","Employer Services revenue was $48 million, down 5% compared to last year, reflecting weakness in both tax management and Talent Assessment Services.","The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 24.4%, up from 23.0% in the third quarter of 2011, once again, due to the strong performance in verification services.","Our North American Personal Solutions revenue was $51 million for the quarter, up 13%. Strong growth in our higher-value products and further penetration in Canada were the major contributors to this performance. Operating margin was 32.1% compared to 32.8% in the third quarter of 2011.","North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $21 million, down 2% on a reported basis and down 1% on a local currency basis. Double-digit growth in U.S. risk activities was offset by a double-digit decline in our U.S. marketing activities, as lenders have continued to be cautious in the small business segment.","The operating margin was 18.8%, down from 23.6% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting continued investment in building our capabilities, despite lack of near-term revenue growth.","Corporate expense was up 18% compared to the third quarter in 2011, largely driven by investment in enterprise-wide infrastructure and capabilities as well as additional incentive compensation resulting from better-than-expected operating results. Our corporate tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%, down from 36.2% in the same quarter of 2011. Excluding the unanticipated discrete tax benefit in the quarter, the corporate tax rate would have been 36.3%, consistent with our recent past.","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Lee. Let me just give you some closing comments, then we'll jump to some Q&A. I'm proud of this team. This team continues to execute at very high levels, allowing us to deliver yet another solid quarter. As you know, I think you agree, we have the broadest array of powerful consumer data assets in our industry. We've invested heavily over the years in linking this data together, as well as linking together second and third-party data. We're also investing in our analytical expertise to ensure we develop an absolute best insight out of that data. And as I stated earlier, our strategy is really resonating well with the customers in every sector in which we serve. We're now operating from a position of real strength to continue driving solid organic revenue growth for the foreseeable future. You'll hear more details about that when we have our Investor Day in December up with at the New York Stock Exchange.","As we enter the fourth quarter, we see the same fundamentals continuing and now expect this momentum to continue into 2013. And again, we'll discuss in great detail the strategy and the outlook for 2013 at the Investor Day. We now expect full year 2012 revenue growth for the company, excluding Brazil, to be at or above the top end of the 11% to 12% range we quoted during the second quarter earnings call. And for adjusted earnings per share growth, additional 3 to 4 points as a result of operating in the financial leverage. This outlook assumes that mortgage marketing continues at its present rate for the remainder of the quarter and, in fact, I expect the mortgage market to continue well into 2013 at this juncture, probably at least through the first 2 quarters of 2013.","For the fourth quarter, assuming current exchange rates at a continuation of the mortgage activity we've experienced, our outlook for revenue growth from continuing operations is expected to be between 8% and 10% adjusted EPS, from continuing operations is expected to be between $0.72 and $0.76 per share for the quarter.","And finally, we are looking forward to visiting with you at our Investor Day on December 6 with the Stock Exchange. Given the strong positive response to date, I'd encourage you to respond RSVP at your earliest convenience so we can be sure to accommodate everyone's interest because we're -- a limited number of people can actually host in the facility. For those of you who don't -- won't be able to attend in personal, we'll be webcasting it and taking questions from our web-based audience during the Q&A session. So again, we hope we can see you there on the 6th of December.","Operator, if you would please open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Lee, there's been a little bit of volatility in the USCIS operating margin. Could you elaborate a bit? You were up above 38% last quarter and right around 37% this quarter. Is there any seasonality, or anything else we can kind of tease out of those results to discern a trend as we go forward here?","Lee Adrean","Andrew, I think a couple of things. The most important is actually the mix of business as we flow quarter-to-quarter. For instance, from Q2, our IXI business unit, because of the way they deliver their services, tend to have the strongest quarters in Q2 and Q4. And when they get -- but their expenses are relatively ratable through the year. So IXI will contribute much more strongly to margin in Q2 and Q4. As we move from Q2 to Q3, IXI revenue fell off as they always do. And we made up some of that with mortgage. But as we increase mortgage revenue, that also drags along with it some direct cost. So simple things like mix quarter-to-quarter, a little bit of seasonality Q2 and Q4 as a result of IXI. There will be some fluctuations when mortgages surging versus moderating some. Those are some of the factors that cause quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. We really don't try to manage quarterly margin at a business unit level. There are too many things that can intervene. Obviously, we do try to drive consistent performance at a total company level, but the business units will tend to fluctuate.","Richard F. Smith","Andrew, Rick here. Just to reinforce Lee's point, I think, if you look at year-to-date trends, so 3 quarters year-to-date, 2011 versus 2012, you'll see a very positive momentum. If you look at third quarter of 2011 versus third quarter of 2012, you'll see positive growth. And to Lee's point, with the IXI and mix changes, you'd expect to see a nice move up in the fourth quarter on the margin as well.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Yes, strong volume cures a lot of ills, doesn't it? It also sounds like, perhaps, there's a shifting mix that is benefiting your overall pricing. Maybe it's a change in contract structure. I know you sort of have a rationalization or a reset of price last year? Could you just talk directionally about how you see your pricing, both specifically for Equifax but also in the context of the overall sort of competitive USCIS environment?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, One thing, Andrew, we've talked about now for years is that we continue to invest heavily in our strategic pricing team and we get great results, an increasing result out of the team each and every quarter. That team is focusing on bundling of our unique data assets to maximize the value we can bring to our customers and the price we can bring to our shareholders and profit to our shareholders. So I'm pleased with what they're doing. I'd say we're still at the early stages, but even though we've been out now for 6 years, I think there's a lot of runway left for us on pricing.","Lee Adrean","Yes, and Andrew, I'd add a couple of things first. Certainly, pricing has been important, and we've talked in the last couple of quarters about some pricing initiatives from last year, which we're seeing flowing in, in our results this year. Second, there is a mix issue. When mortgage is particularly strong, our pricing into the mortgage sector tends to be more attractive than, for instance, into the credit card sector. So you can get some mix effects. The third thing, again, a different element of our strategy is we introduce additional products and services. Some of those are add-ons to the credit report revenue we already have, and that causes our combined average price to rise. And whether that's in what I've described as some of the services outside of pure traditional credit reports but flow-through USCIS, you see that addition to revenue growth on top of just pure unit price. We're actually working to come up with a little better way of measuring our average revenue per transaction, but you're seeing the effects of all 3: Pricing, the mortgage mix tends to help us when it's quite strong, but also product initiatives that we've been driving for several years.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Perlin at RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, you called out strength across new home sales, the post refinancings, and there's a lot of, obviously, questions around mix in mortgage. Can you just -- can you help us understand a little bit what the dynamics might look like if we saw that trend in new home sales versus refinancings accelerate, both in terms of absolute dollars of revenues per those types of transactions and then the margin implications?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, Dan, one of the things that's important to note that the new home sales are, in fact, strengthening. It's on even -- depends on where you are in the country, but overall it's strengthening from a very low base. We still have a long way to go. So again, I think, it's an encouraging thing if you think about mortgage. We have a long way to go before we get back to the historical levels of 2004, '05, '06 and even '07. And then we expect that to continue to improve at a modest rate in 2013. We expect refinancing, as I mentioned before, to continue to improve -- to continue at good levels for the first -- at least first 2 quarters of 2013. The point I'll make there is, I said in my opening comments, we are innovating at very, very high levels across the company, including mortgage. We have a team in the mortgage business that has got great domain expertise, and their ability to build new products and new solutions in the mortgage market is helping us grow, regardless what the mortgage market itself does, is encouraging. As I think about margins, I don't see a significant difference in margins for refinancing versus that of original home sales. Those tend to be about the same. There are some nuances there, but generically about the same. And the margins for the new price, obviously, tend to be a little low as you start off and grow over time.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as we think about kind of setting the business up from -- we look at your incremental margins, you guys have been producing, and we adjust them this quarter, they've been pretty consistent. A little bit below 30%, a couple of points. Is that, you think, a sustainable level? And I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, you've had a lot of moving parts in this year when we kind of compared margins and try to adjust them as investments. There's Brazil, there's mortgage, hyperactivity. And I'm just trying to make sure I understand the trajectory as you think about the business going forward, not to steal any thunder at the Analyst Day, but is the incremental margin at, call it, 25% to 30%, is that a sustainable level?","Richard F. Smith","Let's see if I can answer your question this way. We made a commitment that we see a path of continuing to grow year-on-year on margins about 25 basis points a year while continuing to grow or investing organic growth. If that's the heart of your question, yes. I see the trajectory line continuing at that 25 basis points for 2013 and beyond.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And let me just ask 2 other quick ones. You called out insurance becoming more important. I would be interested to hear a little more detail around that. And then also, you called out kind of these co-development deals, which sounds pretty interesting and pretty good for margins. So I'd be interested to hear a little more about that, if you could, please.","Richard F. Smith","Sure. On insurance, I think, we've mentioned that -- boy, you're testing my memory now. I think it's been a few years ago, we had a large win then. We've really pulled back in the insurance sector post the divestiture of ChoicePoint with our unique 360 data assets. We looked at that marketplace a couple of years ago, became intrigued, won a couple of nice pieces of business. So it's a continuation of what we announced then, Dan, it's just really leveraging the data 360 assets to add value and solve problems that others in the industry cannot solve. We're hiring some very good people and learning here as you get people really understand the verticals -- in this case, insurance. They bring great value and immediate value to us there. So the combination of good expertise and unique data assets is proving valuable in insurance. As it relates to the co-development, yes, that is encouraging. I mentioned to you there, it's allowing banks to co-develop with us to develop insights from their data and our data to build new solutions. That alone is manifesting itself in immediate revenue. But the most exciting thing is, as our customers get into our data assets and co-work with us, we are convinced that can lead to future new products down the road. So the incremental revenue as we look forward 2013 and '14 with these large banks. I think it's very, very encouraging, and we're leading the way there with these large banks, which is neat.","Operator","And we'll go next to Julio Quinteros at Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just touch on 2 things? One on the government opportunities. I think this is the first time, I think, I've heard you guys talk a little more directly about Anakam and some of the multi-factor authentication capabilities there. So I was hoping to see a little more color on that front and then -- let me just stop there and then I can follow up with the second one.","Richard F. Smith","It is -- you're right, we really ramped up our efforts in the government sector when we bought Anakam maybe 2 years ago. They brought not only product capabilities that could help us solve identity fraud issues with different arms of the government -- and I'm not going to go into a lot of details which arms they are -- but number two, it brought the context and the ability for us to actually open the way towards the combination of the Anakam two-factor authentication with our -- of our data assets and a product we called eID kind of bundling of those 3 products together is really gaining great traction across a multitude of government entities, which is really encouraging.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is there any way to take that to the commercial marketplace,, or is there a sense there that that can be ported over to commercial enterprises as well?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, great question. Yes, the answer is yes. If I think about the traction we're getting with the combination of those 3 efforts again, two-factor authentication, knowledge-based decisioning off of our database and then eID, it's -- we are going to take it to government, health care and the FIs . There's a clear need in all 3.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Switching gears over to the International front. At least, relative to our numbers a little bit lighter in terms of the revenue performance, some puts and takes, as you think about the rest of this year and maybe even next year, where would you sort of highlight any key risks, obviously, Europe? But is there anything in particular that you would point to where there could still be some risks on the International revenue growth front?","Richard F. Smith","Let's see if I can answer by putting some color on what's occurring in our International. Again, I think it's important to your baseline the fact that, in Latin America, we're still growing 9%; I think it's very, very encouraging. Number two, growing 7% on a local currency basis in a very troubled European market is encouraging. I didn't mention Russia. Russia, we have just great, great success in Russia and great success in India as well, as you think about International. Go to specifically, maybe some themes that are occurring in the International footprints. There's some regulatory uncertainty in a couple of places in Latin America and in Canada that the team is now working through. But that regulatory uncertainty caused a slowdown, a temporary slowdown in a couple of markets. So while the underlying market might have been a little stronger, the regulatory uncertainty caused a slowdown for a few quarters. And we're going to work through that, and the team's done a great job of that. And we'll hope to get through that uncertainty as we exit 2012, moving to 2013.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Presumably the severance charges and some of the things you try to do to realign the business will help protect the margins as we go forward through that?","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Operator","And we'll go next to Georgios Mihalos at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to start off a sort of a housekeeping item. On the 12% constant currency growth, is it about 500 or 600 basis points that came from mortgage -- is the math right there?","Richard F. Smith","It's about -- we'll look at Jeff is here. Is that about right, Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Dodge","It's about 1% acquisition, about 4% mortgage. Actually a little less than 4% and a little over 7% core and initiative growth.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. Got you. And then, Lee, you were talking about some of the regulatory issues in Chile. Is there a way to think about how much that impacted growth in the LatAm region? Was it significant?","Richard F. Smith","I don't have the exact calculation, but for Chile, it's obviously important. For LatAm and for the company as a whole, it's relatively de minimis. And we haven't broken that out. And again, I think, the most important thing to think about there is we've got a great team working with the different branches of the government in Chile -- in fact, in all parts of the world -- to get through these regulatory uncertainties. So I'm confident we'll do so.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned the subscription portion of PSol going up to 68%. How much higher do you think you can really go from this level?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it's a pretty good level there. I think 68% to 75% seems to be a reasonable target for us, and a target we're comfortable with.","Operator","And we'll move next to Eric Boyer at Wells Fargo.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Rick, you talked about the revenue growth within mortgage not just being about volume increases but the product innovation that you guys have been doing over the last couple of years. Do you have a rough sense of the revenue growth from those new products versus the mortgage market strength you're seeing?","Richard F. Smith","I don't think we break that out. Lee, do you have those numbers by chance or directional?","Lee Adrean","Yes. If I look at the total of USCIS, it growing at about 15%, about 7% or so is mortgage market, about 2 points are some of the major pricing initiatives from a year ago, but we're looking at 5% or 6% just pure organic initiative growth.","Richard F. Smith","Looking specifically, I think, mortgage growth is from new products.","Lee Adrean","Out of the mortgage, sorry.","Richard F. Smith","I don't think -- we don't break that out. I don't have it off the top of my head. But here's what you should note. I said a little earlier that we have a really solid team in mortgage. They've got deep domain expertise. They are churning out new products in an unbelievable rate, leveraging all the different unique data assets we have. And I can tell you this: For the mortgage business in the U.S., it's a nice piece of growth. I don't remember the exact numbers.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just as on the revelatory issues, they're different than the IXI regulatory issues that you've been talking about. Is that correct?","Richard F. Smith","When we talk International, correct. There's stuff going on in Chile or Canada -- is much different under than the IXI issue. And the IXI issue is worth just spending a second on. It is being driven around uncertainty, not a regulatory decision at this juncture. It's uncertainty around where regulation might go, specific to a couple of attributes within the database, specifically age and location. So we're working with our customers to modify models that are as predictive to take some of the areas where they're concerned or where regulation might go out of the equation. And we're very hopeful that we get that resolved very soon.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So I mean you really don't have to reposition IXI in any type of major way?","Richard F. Smith","No. We've already proven statistically that if we modify the model to exclude the attributes that they're concerned about, it is as predictable as the old model.","Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just finally, can you give us a little more detail around the severance charge you took in the quarter?","Richard F. Smith","It's nothing significant. It's nits and nats as a number of people across Latin America just trying to reposition the company for the future needs a little bit in the U.K. Nothing -- no one thing is significant and no one thing is really strategic. It's a small number relative to our size of the business, $3.7 million.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","2 quick questions. One, the 8% to 10% for the fourth quarter, what would be the constant currency number? And the second, you talked about regulatory uncertainty in Latin America; you called out Chile. Wasn't there a very recent positive data change in the law in Brazil? Do you consider this a very monumental change for the consumer credit reporting industry in Brazil, and when do you think the kind of uptake will occur?","Richard F. Smith","Andrew, this is Rick. I'll let Lee get the constant currency growth rate for the fourth quarter in a second as it relates to Brazil and the positive data ruling. It's important you look back in time and you go back 5 years ago. We and others were very bullish at the time that positive data would be forthcoming and will be a catalyst to revenue. Here we are 5, 6 years later, and we're still muddling around and trying to determine what that really means and when the revenue might be forthcoming. Strategically, there's no doubt about it. When the country moves to positive data, it is a good thing. It helps them with risk-based pricing and that has proven to be a catalyst for growth in our industry. At this juncture, I'm still in the sidelines. And my view is it's probably 2 years or so, maybe 3 years away, before you actually start to see revenue traction from positive data in Brazil. It's a number of years beyond that before you see significant revenue. Lee, you got...","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is that because it takes the consumer credit reporting companies time to use that data? Is that the 2- to 3-year lag?","Richard F. Smith","It's more than that. It's also getting the government to determine if it's opt in versus opt out, what are the policies and rules behind it. Just declaring you're going to have positive data doesn't mean much. It's getting underneath that and understanding what that really is. And right now, they're leaning towards a opt-in. So in other words, the consumer has to prove you're using the positive data, that's number one. Number two, it does take time for us and others to build the database, so you can actually use the database on positive data. Lee, you have the constant currency?","Lee Adrean","Andrew, based on our current view on FX rates, we think the constant currency growth is probably going to be about 0.5 point lower than the nominal. So if we're saying 8% to 10% reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter, constant currency will be 7.5% to 9.5%.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And we anniversary-ed all the acquisitions, so that's also the organic number, right?","Lee Adrean","That is correct.","Richard F. Smith","Correct.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Togut at Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Could you give us an update on the status of your discussions with computer sciences with respect to the possible exercise of the right to put the credit services joint venture back to you?","Richard F. Smith","Dave, as you know we don't talk about acquisitions. But I mentioned, I think, it was last -- a number of times with you and others that their CEO, Mike Lowry, has made a statement a number of times in the public domain that he is interested in disposing of noncore assets, and we hope that he would see this franchise in the middle part of the country as noncore. And if he does, we stand prepared to work with him, and hope we negotiate a deal. Nothing more than that.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. Then just as a follow-up, Rick, can you bring us up-to-date with respect to the financial performance of Boa Vista? And in particular, related question, will there be any impact in your view of Experian's buyout of the remaining 30% of Serasa in Brazil?","Richard F. Smith","Our team, which is down in Brazil this week -- in fact, they're still there and come back tonight. We have -- we have a board meeting down there this week and we'll make -- continue to make really good strides on all fronts. So as far as operational integration, product development, systems, platforms, pricing, strategy, so on and so forth, building the NPI process down there, all those things are working well. We've got a really good working relationship with ACSP, TMG and Boa Vista along with Equifax. We still remain very interested in making that platform a success going forward. As it relates to Experian buying out now up to 99.6% of Serasa, no, that has no bearing on our strategy or our optimism for the market going forward.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a sense of what Boa Vista's revenue growth was in the quarter?","Richard F. Smith","It's no -- we don't consolidate, so I can't. But it's growing nicely, we leave it at that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Carter Malloy at Stephens.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","On the CMS business, you talked about IXI. But can you strip out the core credit marketing business and tell us about trends within that? And then what sort of a leading indicator, that is or that it provides you guys for OCIS? Maybe you could even tease out how important cards is to OCIS as well.","Richard F. Smith","I think we've mentioned somewhere in either Mike's question to Lee is the core credit marketing business, what we used to call CMS, so excluding IXI, had good growth in the quarter with a solid 7% for fourth quarter. Carter, I missed the last part of your question.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So first of all, sorry to repeat that, you said that the core CMS -- or IXI declined and the core CMS actually grew really nicely.","Richard F. Smith","Correct.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And is that a change from last quarter? If so, does that provide you a good leading indicator on the card piece of OCIS?","Richard F. Smith","Well, again, we answer it in 2 ways. One is that you got fluctuation seasonality in IXI throughout the year. You have a very strong fourth quarter, relatively strong second quarter, and modest performance in first and second. So yes, there was a change in marketing in IXI in the third quarter versus second quarter that will be driven the natural fluctuations you see in IXI. As far as card, card is okay. Our prescreened is up solidly. Portfolio Management is up solidly. But the overall card market still remains a little sluggish.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you tease out how important cards is to the overall OCIS segment?","Richard F. Smith","I don't have that off the top of my head.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is it safe to say it's the majority of revenues there or approaching 50% maybe?","Richard F. Smith","No, I think it's less than 50% -- I don't know. I don't have a number.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then also on the mortgage business to go back to that again, you guys are very much outperforming the rest of the market there. So as we step into next year, even with a strong first half, we're looking at all the forecast calling for down 20%, 25% year-over-year next year. How much do you expect to outperform that market, right? So if we use existing forecast today of down 20%, does that imply for you guys a 2- or 3-point headwind next year overall?","Lee Adrean","Well, one, I think you're going to see a changing perspective on the mortgage market as time passes. The old data, you're correct, talked about a 20%-ish decline, 21% decline. I think as you exit this year, you're going to see the economists, MBA and most importantly, the top underwriters of mortgages take a different and more optimistic stance. You've already heard a few of them in their earnings call talk about that. So I think what you're going to see is far less than a 20% to 25% decline next year. I think you'll see a strong first half of the year in mortgage, and you'll see a weaker second half of the year. And whatever that number is, and as we get maybe to Investor Day, we'll have some greater transparency for you, Carter. Whatever that number is, yes, we would expect our team to perform at a significantly better rate than that market decline, and that's because of our innovation. So if you'd bear with me, wait till we get to the December Investor Day, we'll frame up for you the stake in the ground that we're putting for mortgage market, and that what we expect for our mortgage business.","Operator","We'll move next to Manav Patnaik at Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Some quick questions. First thing, could you elaborate a little bit more about what the regulatory uncertainty is in Canada? And also I guess, the CFPB has been in the press quite a bit, just wondering what your latest discussions with them have led you to believe what's going on there?","Richard F. Smith","Let me start with the latter and come back to Canada. CFPB, obviously, we're in very close contact and communication with them. Their whole focus now, as it relates to us and our industry, is that governance and ensuring that we have a proper governance structure in place to comply with any potential new regulations that would be forthcoming. So we're spending some time and energy just making sure that our governance process, governance structured, governance communication, governance cadence is proper, and the team is making really, really good strides there. So that's where a lot of our energy is right now with CFPB. There has been no clear mandate or new regulations imposed at this juncture. Stay tuned. As we learn, obviously, we will use this vehicle and others to communicate to you. But I think the team's done a great job. We'll continue to do a good job of responding to and reacting to CFPB. As it relates to Canada, it's always important to put it in perspective, too, because the regulatory impact there, when you look at the entire company, was de minimis. It focused on the mortgage market and regulatory change in the mortgage market, which did impact the mortgage business in Canada. The mortgage business in Canada is small relative to the total business. I think, Lee, it's 15%-ish, 20% in that range. And the specific regulation that came out in Canada, I don't remember exactly what it was. Lee, you might.","Lee Adrean","The issue in Canada did not -- actually has nothing to do with our services to the mortgage market. The Canadian financial authorities are trying to reduce -- has reduced the bubble or any risk of a mortgage bubble and they have increased required down payments and made some other changes to deflate the real estate market a bit. The amortization schedules on mortgages have now been brought in from 30 years to 25 years, so payments were up a little. And they're just trying to make sure that they don't get a mortgage bubble. But what that's done very short term is slow the demand in mortgages. So it really is actions by the government to avoid the bubble, but it has weakened mortgage demand.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And I guess, in terms of the free cash flow guidance, I guess, you had given earlier and CapEx as well, can you maybe update us? Is there some seasonality you expect in the fourth quarter with those in issue? I think you had said $240 million to $260 million, and CapEx, $75 million to $95 million, all those end up being below what you guys come up with.","Lee Adrean","I think the CapEx is probably heading to a lower number than $95 million. I don't actually remember the number, but it's probably pretty linear through the year. CapEx to date is about $50 million, that would project out to about $70 million for the year. The -- I'll be honest, free cash flow, I haven't focused on it as much on. Our cash flow has been strong this year. And...","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, is there any seasonality in the fourth quarter that would maybe have a drop from the last 2 quarters that you've been pretty strong?","Lee Adrean","No. The seasonality of our cash flow is first quarter is low because of the timing of certain payments and the other 3 quarters tend to be roughly equivalent. We've had actually very good working capital management in the last couple of quarters. We probably can't keep doing that and making gains every quarter, but I would expect fourth quarter cash flow to be good.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Warmington at Raymond James.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So a couple of questions for you. First, just wanted to ask what NPI was running in the quarter. And then the second was to ask about the Commercial Solutions business, just whether if there's anything going on in the competitive dynamics there with D&B that's either hurting or helping the situation.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, NPI continues to run strong. We have a targeted number of 10% for vitality and you always have swings quarter-to-quarter. But the trajectory continues to be on that same pace. So it's doing well.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So to say, how is it swinging in this quarter?","Richard F. Smith","That was a good quarter, solid, yes. And broad-based, too. Again, it's every business unit, every geography. We're still in that 10% range as far as vitality goes. As far as the market dynamics for Commercial, there's no real change there. It's less about what Experian or D&B are doing in the marketplace. It's more about the marketing side of our commercial business being slow. Our core U.S. risk business in the U.S. continues to operate well, and I'm hopeful. We gave a guidance, it was last quarter, but it was the total year commercial would grow in the low single digit. I'm still committed to that low single-digit number, which by default means you have that growth in the fourth quarter.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then, I also want to ask you, if I could, on NCTUE+. Just to ask about how customers are using that data and what kind of growth you're seeing there. And then also to ask about the M&A pipeline; you've anniversary-ed DataVision now. What are your thoughts there?","Richard F. Smith","As far as NCTUE+, it is growing extremely well. It is over twice the size of what the business was last year, and we expect it to continue to grow in the future. Most of the growth initially starts with those building solutions for those companies that provide the data, so in the telco utility arena. We're now taking that database, working with our board of NCTUE+ and taking it into other verticals such as FI and insurance. So if you look long term, there's 2 things that happen: we continue to grow the database, which adds value. We continue to diversify away from just the contributors of data to new verticals, and that will be propel growth, I'm convinced, for a number of years to come. So it is doing extremely well, Bill, to answer your question. As far as M&A pipeline, the M&A pipeline continues to be very, very strong. It centers all the things we had traditionally looked at, which is data sources, tuck-in acquisitions around the world, geographical expansions, analytics. So it's a strong pipeline, strategic pipeline, and so it's going well, all linked back to our strategy.","Operator","And our next question comes from Paul Ginocchio at Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Personal Solutions. You had accelerating growth on a tougher comp. I'm just wondering if you've seen any pickup in the competitive landscape. Is there more marketing spend out there for potential subscribers and what's the outlook?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it's a very competitive marketplace, and we are outspending. If you just look at the marketing spend of our team versus other very large competitors out there, we're outspent, multiples what we spent, which is remarkable. When you look at the performance that Trey and his team have continued to deliver by becoming very sophisticated in how they measure churn, how they develop new products, and the repositioning of the pricing of the products, looking at ARPU -- just has done a very good job. As far as the future, yes, I continue to see our business, as we always said, as a double-digit growth business with a 25% plus margins and the teams have deliver that. We told you that was the goal for our business for a number of years, and I see that same kind of performance going forward.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Let me sneak one more in on -- I know it's a small region, Iberia, relative to the U.K. Is there a wide diversions to the growth rate between those 2 European regions?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I don't remember. The answer is yes. We find U.K. growing at a slightly faster rate, but they're both in the single digits. It's not like you've got Iberia in a flat or negative growth rate. They're both growing at single-digit rates.","Operator","And next we'll go to Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a number of questions, just tying up some loose ends from previous quarters. Last quarter, you guys noted that there was a downward trend through the quarter on credit card openings. Has that stabilized through the third quarter, or what did you guys see over there?","Richard F. Smith","Jeff, you know what? Jeff, I'm with you. Is it stabilized?","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Yes, it's pretty stable. It's up a little.","Richard F. Smith","We're just looking to Jeff for exact number. He said yes, it's stable versus second quarter, and maybe a slight upward trend, but nothing dramatic.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So we saw kind of a downward trend through the second quarter and the third quarter, it stabilized maybe up a little bit. That's the way to think about it and that's what you're seeing now?","Richard F. Smith","Correct.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then where are you guys in India in terms of investment versus profits? I mean, you've guys had historically given out some metrics in terms of numbers and contributors. How should we think of that business in general and vis-\u00e0-vis the competition over there?","Richard F. Smith","Yes Shlomo, I will profess I don't remember the exact numbers. We just had a review on India recently. Let me give you some color on it, and Lee, if you remember the exact numbers, you can jump in. If not, we'll address it in detail on December 6 at the Investor Day. Across every operational metric you can think of as far as adding new contributors of data, number of records to file, companies to file, hit rate against the file, number of customers testing products, all those things are going extremely well and giving us the foundation for which to start building products and actually monetizing it. As far as financially at this juncture, we're still in the phase of investing and building and not yet at the point of breakeven. Financial breakeven probably comes 1 or 2 years down the road.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then what percentage -- I guess, this is a metric-based question, what percentage of the total company is mortgaged, what percentage of USCIS is mortgaged and what percentage of verification services is mortgaged?","Richard F. Smith","I'll start with the first and look at my friend to my right, Lee, to get the others if we, in fact, break those out, if we're not, just respond that way, Lee. But as far as the company, the company has historically, since I've been here, been in the range of the teens up to as high as, I think, 22% of the total company revenue as a percent of mortgage. Obviously, with refinancing being a little stronger now than it was in the past, we're around 20%, just under -- just over 20% this particular quarter. So over a multi-year period of time, clearly within the range, you would expect versus maybe the last few years, up a bit.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And do you guys break it out for the other verticals, USCIS and verification?","Richard F. Smith","We have not.","Lee Adrean","Broad numbers, I think it's between 25% and 30% for USCIS, and it's about 30% of Workforce Solutions.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then my last question. Leverage has been going down not because you guys are necessarily paying it off, but you guys are growing. But still, Lee, I remember asking you what you were comfortable about in terms of your leverage ratio. And you said 1.7 to 2.25, 1.75 to 2.25. You are now about 1. Is that kind of you guys teeing up for a big acquisition? Or just -- can you talk about that a little bit because, I mean, you could take on more debt and buy back stock if you weren't looking for flexibility in a different way.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I'll jump in, and Lee can talk specifically about the capital structure we're thinking. But you're right, I think we said 1.75 to 2.2 or 2.25. We're at the low end of that range. And it's always going to go up and down over a period of time, as you know. Someone asked the question earlier, how do I feel about -- I think it was Bill, feel about the M&A pipeline. The M&A pipeline is strong, and we'll continue to look at, obviously, paying a strong dividend, buying back shares where shares make sense, investing on organic growth and M&A. And at this juncture, there is some strong M&A pipeline. We'd, as always, like to continue execute against. So you're going to see it drop from 1.9%, 2% down to the 1%. And you'll see it for a time go back up. We'll continue to operate within that range and over a short period of time, you may have some anomalies like you see now.","Lee Adrean","I'll just have 2 things. I think what we've said over the last couple of years has been 1.75 to 2x, and my calculation on our current position is about 1.4x. But that's where it will tend to float from time to time.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Okay. I want to thank everybody for participating on the call today. And operator with that, we'll conclude the call.","Operator","Thank you. And again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8881":["Equifax, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Trevor Burns. Please go ahead.","Trevor Burns","Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including second quarter and full year 2019 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk factors, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations.","Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance.","For the first quarter of 2019, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes costs associated with the realignment of internal resources and other activities, acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards, recognized upon vesting or settlement, and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets.","Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes an accrual for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incident, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations as well as the incremental non-recurring project costs designed to enhance our technology and data security.","This includes project costs to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as the projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global network and systems as well as the cost to manage these projects. These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019 and 2020.","Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding an accrual for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.","Costs related to 2017 cybersecurity incident costs associated with the realignment of internal resources and other activities, and foreign currency losses from re-measuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets.","These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. In addition to the non-GAAP measures that we posted on our website, we will post after this call certain supplemental financial information on our website, to better help you understand our business. Included with the supplemental information is historical actual, and 2019 forecast U.S. mortgage market inquiries.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark.","Mark Begor","Thanks, Trevor and good morning everyone. As you could see from our press release this morning this has been a busy quarter for us particularly during the past few weeks and days. We're pleased with our start to 2019 with strong progress on our strategic priorities and our financial results were within the guidance we provided in February, while we are continuing to return USIS to a growth mode, we're executing well against our EFX 2020 initiatives.","Before I get into a discussion of our first quarter financial results and the business units, let me spend a few minutes discussing the $690 million charge we took this quarter related to outstanding litigation and potential fines related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.","We delayed our earnings discussion until this morning because we've made significant progress on our legal and regulatory settlements in the past few weeks. As you know we've been in active discussions for months related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and those discussions accelerated in the past month.","Importantly, the $690 million accrual we booked includes our estimate of probable losses associated with our global settlement discussions with certain federal and state regulators as well as the federal class action cases.","We recently reached confidential settlement terms in the consumer federal class action cases, that upon approval by the court, will resolve and dismiss the claims asserted in the consumer cases. The proposed global settlement provides for the establishment of a single consumer redress fund which was our goal and certain other non-monetary terms.","As we've discussed previously, we believe the consumers are better served through a single consumer fund and a global settlement of the federal and state government investigations together with the consumer class action litigation. We expect to complete definitive settlement agreements with the parties in the coming weeks.","While this charge represents our current estimate to resolve many of the significant issues facing the company, we expect to incur additional losses associated with the other claims and litigation related to the 2017 incident. We will continue to work with all parties to bring these matters to closure as soon as possible, while balancing the needs of our company, employees, customers, and shareholders.","As you know we've prepared ourselves financially for the settlement by strengthening our balance sheet, including suspending our stock buyback, and freezing our dividend in 2017. This settlement will not have an impact on our internal investment plans, new product introductions, our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 technology and security program or our plans to grow and expand Equifax with acquisitions. This is a positive step forward for Equifax as we work to put the 2017 cybersecurity event behind us. Let me now move to our financial results. We're pleased with our start to the year as our first quarter financial results were consistent with the guidance we gave you in February with revenue in the middle and adjusted EPS at the top of the range provided.","Revenue at $846 million was up almost 1% in constant currency. Foreign exchange further weakened during the quarter relative to our February guidance impacting revenue negatively by just under $2 million. During the quarter, U.S. mortgage market inquiries again declined meaningfully, down 10% but were better than our projection of down 13%. Excluding the almost 2% negative mortgage market impact total constant currency revenue growth was 2.5% and we were pleased with that.","Overall, our combined U.S. B2B businesses, USIS, and EWS performed better than our expectations, both benefiting relative to expectations due to the mortgage market with U.S. also delivering nice growth in offline revenue and EWS delivering very strong Verification Services revenue growth. EWS saw weakness in Employer Services revenue which impacted overall growth.","International revenue was only marginally weaker than our expectations as somewhat weaker than expected revenue in Australia was mostly offset by stronger revenue in Canada. And GCS was a bit weaker than we expected driven by lower U.S. subscriber growth. This weaker than expected GCS revenue was -- offset the better than expected performance in U.S. B2B.","Adjusted EPS of $1.20 per share was on the top end of the guidance we provided in February. In the first quarter, total non-recurring or one-time cost related to the cybersecurity incident in our transformation exclusive of the accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident were $97 million and consistent with our expectations. This includes $83 million of technology and security spending, $12 million for legal and investigative fees, and $2 million for consumer support. We continue to expect 2019 one-time cost related to the cybersecurity incident and transformation exclusive of any legal accruals to be about $350 million.","Now for some comments on the business units. USIS revenue was down almost 3% on a reported basis as we expected compared to last year with USIS up about 50 basis points excluding over three percentage point negative impact of the mortgage market on revenue. And that 50 basis point increase ex mortgage was quite positive from our perspective.","In the quarter, we also saw a mix shift in our mortgage business with transaction shifting towards our reseller channel. This also negatively impacted USIS revenue by over 1% in the quarter. Adjusting for both of these factors non-mortgage revenue growth was up almost 1.5%, a positive sign of continued improvement by USIS and was slightly better than our expectations for the quarter.","Our new USIS leader, Sid Singh is driving a new level of energy and accountability with our customers in the USIS team. Inside of USIS, Mortgage Solutions was down 23% in the quarter, given the decline in the overall mortgage market and due to the mix shift with mortgage resellers, which occurred in fourth quarter 2018.","Our USIS mortgage revenue can be impacted by movements between our 3-Bureau business in Mortgage Solutions and selling a single file to a mortgage reseller, which is included in our online business. We manage our Mortgage Solutions 3-Bureau business such that it\u2019s dollar profit contributions exceeds the dollar profit of a single file to the reseller.","Mix shift had negative impact of over 1% in USIS revenue growth in the first quarter while USIS operating profit was not materially impacted. We expect the revenue headwind from the mortgage mix shift to continue for the remainder of 2019.","Financial Marketing Services was up about 6% driven by new deal wins. This is the first time we've seen growth in FMS since prior to the cybersecurity incident. While we are encouraged by the growth in FMS this quarter, the timing of closing deals is still not as predictable as it was prior to the cybersecurity incident, which may impact the timing of future revenue in \u2013 it may impact the timing of revenue in future quarters.","Online was down 1% but was up 2% excluding the mortgage market impact. While online did benefit from the mortgage market mix I previously discussed. This was partially offset by a decline in our direct-to-consumer revenue, which is revenue we generate with the other bureaus.","Online was also benefited from continued growth in our Telecom & Utilities verticals. In terms of customers, we're selling across the portfolio of USIS customers and we should start to continue to see those benefits from these commercial engagement in the second half of 2019. Our pipeline of new business continues to grow positively. We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets in USIS coupled with our technology investments will return the business to its traditional growth mode, but remain cautious on the pace of the recovery. We're confident in the USIS growth plan for 2019.","USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 42.9% were down 120 basis points from first quarter 2018, primarily driven by lower fixed leverage as revenue declined in the quarter and additional investments in security and data analytics to drive new product. Partially offsetting these margin declines, USIS continued to effectively manage their SG&A cost reducing both the dollars and percent of revenue from the fourth quarter restructuring that we did.","Shifting now to Workforce Solutions they had a very strong quarter with revenue up 9%. Verification Services delivered very strong results with revenue up 16% driven by strong double-digit growth across health care, talent solutions, auto and government. EWS like USIS was also impacted by a decline in the overall mortgage market, which negatively impacted revenue by about 2.5 percentage points.","Overall, EWS revenue excluding the negative mortgage market impact grew almost 11%, which we were very pleased with. Employer Services declined in the quarter down almost 4%, driven principally by tax management services given low unemployment levels and to a lesser extent Workforce Analytics and our ACA business talent solutions and our I-9 and onboarding businesses. Also saw growth in the quarter which we expect to continue throughout the year.","We expect Employer Services revenue to be down for the full year consistent with the levels we saw in the first quarter. The strong verifier revenue growth resulted from -- in a very strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 49.4% and expansion in the quarter of 50 basis points. EBITDA margin growth was slightly offset by investments in sales resources to support incremental revenue growth activities. EWS continues to be a great Equifax franchise and positioned for a very strong 2019.","International revenue was down 8% on a reported basis and up 2.5% in local currency, but slightly below our expectations. The slower growth continues to be driven by the weak consumer and commercial lending markets in Australia that started to soften late in the third quarter of last year and to a lesser extent the ongoing weak economic conditions in Argentina.","We expect the Australia and Argentina markets to remain weak through the bulk of 2019 although the revenue growth impacts will begin to lessen in the second half of 2019 as we approach the periods of their initial declines in the third quarter of 2018 in Australia and the second quarter of 2018 in Argentina.","Our Latin America businesses grew mid single-digits in local currency in first quarter despite the continued headwinds in Argentina. Revenue growth was driven by double-digit constant currency growth in Chile and Ecuador and high single-digit constant currency growth in Paraguay and Uruguay. Our Latin America franchises continue to benefit from the expansion of Ignite, InterConnect SaaS and strong NPI rollouts in both 2017 and 2018.","I was in Peru earlier this week meeting with our team and key customers. Our European business in the U.K. and Spain grew mid-single digits in local currency in the first quarter 2019. We saw a mid-single-digit local currency growth in our European credit operations and low single-digit growth in our European debt management business.","I'll be in Madrid and London next week meeting with customers and investors. Canada delivered another strong quarter with high single-digit growth in local currency in the first quarter consistent with the full year revenue growth rate of 8%, we saw in 2018 reflecting a strong focus on customer innovation and new products.","We're excited about the benefits our technology transformation will have in Canada. In the first quarter, we migrated our first Canadian customer into InterConnect in the public cloud. We also completed a small bolt-on acquisition in Montr\u00e9al JLR that brings unique real estate data assets to Equifax in Canada.","Asia Pacific which is predominantly Australia for us declined 2.5% in local currency in the first quarter, principally related to the weakening we began to see in the third quarter last year in Australia consumer lending, particularly in mortgage and other consumer and commercial credit markets on Australia. Although, only one-month data in April, we began to see signs of market bottoming in Australia, we expect second quarter to also see revenue declines but Australia should return to growth in the second half particularly with easier comparisons to last year in the second half.","Despite the strong headwinds in Australia we are encouraged by the growth potential. We continue to win top customers particularly in telco and we continue to hold a substantial data advantage in the Australian market. As we mentioned last year, the move to positive data in Australia continues to progress well.","At the end of April, just over 50% of the consumer account that have been shared \u2013 have been shared and we expect to have over 80% by the end of the third quarter this year. Incorporating positive data will allow us to develop new products for our customers, as well as enable new use cases. For example, incorporating positive data into portfolio management solutions, we believe provides more predictive outcomes than just using negative data. I'll also be in Australia in the next few weeks to spend time with the team and customers.","International adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.3% were down 410 basis points in the first quarter, principally reflecting lower margins Australia and Latin America, driven by Argentina. We expect growth in international to improve in the second quarter and improve significantly in the second half.","Second quarter will be driven by stronger growth in Canada and Latin America and in the second half growth returns to Asia-Pacific, with easier comparisons. We believe this improved growth along with some additional cost reductions taken not only in the fourth quarter, but in the first quarter will significantly improve margins in the second half.","Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions. Their revenue declined almost 9% on a reported basis and 8% in local currency basis in the first quarter and this decline was greater than our expectations. Our global consumer direct business was down about 20% and was just over 40% of total GCS revenue.","As we discussed throughout 2018, our U.S. consumer direct business saw revenue declines about 20% as a result of our suspension of U.S. consumer advertising in the fourth quarter of 2017 after the cybersecurity incident.","GCS began limited direct marketing to U.S. consumers in the fourth quarter, which continued into the first quarter and we're starting to see subscriber growth from our restarted marketing a good sign as we begin 2019. We also continuing to invest in our new consumer platform and are rolling out our myEquifax consumer portal and seeing growth in myEquifax members. We expect to see U.S. subscriber growth as the year unfolds. Our GCS partner businesses which are almost 60% of total GCS revenue delivered mid single-digit growth in the quarter. And ID Watchdog grew double-digits in the quarter, which we expect that growth to continue in 2019.","We expect GCS revenue to be down in second quarter at levels similar to the first quarter. However, starting in third quarter as we lap the periods where the consumer direct revenue began to stabilize in 2018, we expect to see revenue to return to flat and begin to grow in the second half as we move through the remainder of the year and into 2020.","Adjusted GCS EBITDA margins declined as expected in the first quarter as we saw the effective revenue loss and an increase in advertising. However, margins were up nicely on a sequential basis from fourth quarter 2018 reflecting the sequential revenue growth. We expect margins in GCS in the second quarter to remain in the low-20s.","However, we expect margins to increase in the second half as we see the benefit from stable to growing revenue driven by our return to consumer marketing and growing partner revenue as well as some cost actions that we took in the fourth quarter and some additional cost actions we took in the first quarter.","Shifting now to technology, our technology transformation. In the last call, we laid out detailed plan for our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 technology transformation for 2018 and 2020. We're convinced that our technology transformation will differentiate our products and our ability to deliver them by combining unique data assets, analytics and leading technology. It will also accelerate the speed of our products to market and the ease of which they're consumed and reduce our costs as we move our data and applications to the cloud.","We're on plan with our timeline to be completed with most major activities in our EFX 2020 transformation program by late -- by the end of next year. We'll be posting after this call as we did in the first quarter, our quarterly technology plan milestones for 2019 in our Investor Relations deck. Let me give you some commentary on where we stand with our major technology plan tracks through the first quarter.","First, our data fabric is being built on the Google Cloud platform in a virtual private cloud environment utilizing GCP native tooling. Our data fabric will fundamentally make it easier for -- to bring our unique assets together including customer data to create new products and solutions for our customers.","Our data fabric pattern is now in place at Google Cloud -- in the Google Cloud platform and our USIS, EWS, Canadian and corporate teams are working actively on migrating the U.S. consumer credit, The Work Number and Canadian consumer credit exchanges to our new cloud fabric.","Establishing our data fabric pattern at GCP was delayed from our original planning. However, we remain on track to migrate several of our other U.S. and EWS exchanges including NCTUE, IXI, DataX, I-9 and unemployment claims as well as Ignite to the common data fabric by the end of this year. Beginning in the third quarter, any new data sets will be directly ingested into this new cloud-based data fabric. So a very strong progress on this first priority for us in our EFX 2020 transformation.","Second, building on the latest suite of InterConnect and Ignite native -- and Ignite cloud native product offerings, we are using reusable application in cloud native services to rebuild our customer applications.","Over the past year Equifax has worked to migrate these applications to a virtual private cloud using cloud native services. We completed production implementations of Ignite Direct and InterConnect in a virtual private cloud in all global regions.","We expect to complete the integration of Ignite and InterConnect app services in our VPCs this quarter to allow customers to seamlessly promote attributes and models defined in Ignite, including those driven by machine learning into production on interconnect. These services should be broadly available by the end of the second quarter.","Third, we will migrate customers from legacy decisioning systems, interface systems, and Ignite instances to Ignite and Ignite product suite. Over the course of 2019 and 2020, we expect to migrate the vast majority of our customers to our next generation InterConnect and Ignite cloud applications.","In USIS, we are on track to migrate approximately half of these customers by the end of this year with the balance of the customers migrated during 2020. The technology and business teams are focused on deploying standard industry solution sets that will both productize this Ignite + InterConnect service and make the migration experience as frictionless as possible for our customers.","Last, we'll migrate our global consumer systems and customer and consumer support systems using standard application services and cloud native services and operate them in the private cloud.","Our new consumer system, Renaissance, that will include digital consumer support, is in the process of being migrated to a virtual private cloud environment using cloud native services. We expect to launch the first phase with EWS in the third quarter.","Separately, we are deploying Salesforce in an integrated Genesys Google contact center AI solution for customer and call center support worldwide. We expect significant deployment of all this system to be ongoing through the third quarter with consistently -- consistent quarterly releases thereafter.","I hope this gives you a sense of our intense focus and positive progress we have on making our technology transformation that will deliver new cloud-based technology to our customers. We're excited about the strong technology team that Bryson Koehler has built in the past nine months and all of these actions are being executed consistent with our commitment to be a leader in data, analytics, and cloud-based technology.","We continue to be convinced this investment will differentiate Equifax and move us back to a growth and market-leading position. We made good progress in the first quarter and will continue our focused efforts in 2019 and 2020.","Shifting now, M&A remains an important avenue of growth in Equifax and is one of the key elements of our strategy for the future. Last month you saw that USIS closed the acquisition of PayNet, a leader in commercial lending data and insights. We're excited at add PayNet in the team to Equifax. Their proprietary commercial leasing and loan data enables commercial finance and lending institutions to improve credit analytics on business credit underwriting and portfolio reviews.","PayNet complements our existing commercial database that includes trade line information on short-term loans with longer term loans and leasing payment data, a very unique commercial data asset. Customer reaction on the acquisition is very positive and integration is proceeding quickly.","USIS revenue was not benefited in the first quarter by the PayNet acquisition. We expect the contribution to USIS revenue growth to be about 1.5% in the second quarter from the PayNet acquisition.","Next on new product innovation that continues to be a key component of our strategy and a core strengths at Equifax. We have an active pipeline of new product innovations with over 110 new products at various stages in the funnel and we expect to launch over 50 new products in 2019, a pace similar to each of the past three years. We're starting to see an increase in new product deployments in USIS. In the first quarter, USIS launched seven new products, which will start to generate revenue later this year, but have greater opportunities for revenue growth in 2020 and 2021.","As we have discussed, we expect NPI revenue in 2019 will be below historic levels in the U.S. However, this is a positive sign as U.S. collaborates with customers and returns to a growth mode with their new product integrations. In the first quarter, USIS launched a new Insight Score for Personal Loans, which developed in collaboration with FinTechs is a risk score optimized to help lenders evaluate applications taking unsecured personal loans.","The Insight Score for Personal Loans uses advanced modeling techniques by combining Equifax' unique data assets from telecommunications utility and trended data using patented explainable machine learning capabilities to cover a broad spectrum of consumer profiles for personal loans. The new Insight Score for Personal Loans is a win for Fintech companies and consumers as we help lenders develop greater predictive power and improve accuracy when evaluating applicants within or no credit files.","While M&A and NPI are core to our long-term strategy, we believe partnering opportunities are another avenue to deliver revenue growth at Equifax. As you recall in March, we announced a strategic partnership agreement with FICO to launch the Data Decisions Cloud, an integrated end-to-end data and analytics suite that addresses key risk -- key needs across risk marketing and fraud to enable financial institutions to meet the needs of consumers faster and more precisely than ever before.","While we continue to focus on embedding our Ignite + InterConnect platforms with customers, this is an example -- the FICO partnership is an example of using partnerships to extend our reach. You'll see more partnerships to extend our distribution as we move through 2019. We also expect to identify additional areas to partner with FICO on as we continue to work closely with them. I'm very energized about what the FICO partnership means for our financial institutions and consumers.","So wrapping up. We've made several big and positive steps forward in our drive back to market leadership and growth during the first quarter. First, we're pleased with our continued progress with our global settlement discussions with certain federal and state regulators as well as the federal class action lawsuits. We expect these settlements to be completed in the coming weeks and include a single consumer fund.","We are also pleased to reach confidential terms in the U.S. consumer class action lawsuits. As you know, we've been preparing for this settlement and we have the financial structure to absorb it, while continuing to invest in the growth of Equifax internally and externally via acquisitions including new products and our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 investment in security program. This is a positive step forward as we work to put the 2017 cybersecurity event behind us.","Second, financially and operationally, we're pleased with our start to the year. USIS has a new level of energy under Sid Singh. The team is under front feet with customers with pipelines and commercial activity growing positively. EWS had a very strong quarter and is positioned for a very strong 2019. We are watching our international business closely, particularly with the Australian economy.","Third, we continue to invest in strategic acquisitions to expand our data assets including the PayNet acquisition we announced last week. Fourth, we continue to focus intensely on our EFX 2020 technology and transformation plans that will move our data and applications to the cloud.","We believe the investment will deliver speed, growth, and reduce cost, and differentiate us from our competitors. We'll continue to share our progress on EFX 2020 during the rest of the year and in 2020.","Fifth, we continue to focus on expanding partnerships. In this quarter, we launched our new strategic partnership with FICO that brings unique data assets, technology, and analytics to our customers to help them grow faster. You'll see further expansion of partnerships from Equifax as we move to 2019. And then we also continue to focus on new products which -- with strong collaboration with customers.","As I pass the one year mark at EFX, I'm more confident than ever that we are moving Equifax in the right direction with positive progress on all fronts. We're investing at record levels to make Equifax a market leader in data, analytics, and technology, and security. We know that we still have a lot of work to do. We're excited about the opportunity ahead.","John will share more detail, but we're also committing to our prior guidance for 2019. We are confident in our path forward and expect continued positive progress in 2019.","With that let me turn it over to John.","John Gamble","Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on the GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results as well. As Mark covered our overall results, the business unit details, I'll cover overall margins, some corporate items, free cash flow, and our guidance. For all of 2019, U.S. mortgage market increase are expected to decline about 2% versus 2018 which is stronger than the down 5% we had expected in February.","1Q 2019 inquiries were down 10% versus the 13% we had expected in February increases in 2Q 2019 are expected to be down about 1% to be about flat in 3Q 2019 and slightly positive in 4Q 2019. In the first quarter, we extended the resource realignment activities, principally in Australia, the U.K., and GCS that we began in 4Q 2018 that further improve our cost structure. Related to these activities, we incurred an $11 million charge in 1Q 2019. Total savings from the two combined actions are expected to exceed $60 million in 2019 with second half 2019 savings exceeding the first half by about $10 million.","In the first quarter, general corporate expense was $833 million excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident and technology transformation and the cost associated with the realignment of internal resources the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $74 million, up $9 million from 1Q 2018. This was about $5 million better than we had expected. The increase versus 1Q 2018 predominantly reflects the increased investment in security and transformation and related technology as we ramp these costs in the first half of 2018 and increased variable compensation given the timing of hiring certain executives last year.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.5% in 1Q 2019, down 300 basis points from 1Q 2018 and in line with our expectations. As we discussed in February and as discovered in Mark's remarks, the decline in adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-year is principally about two-thirds in BUs, about half in GCS reflecting the lower consumer revenue and return to consumer advertising that Mark discussed, a quarter in USIS as declines in revenue impact fixed leverage and a quarter in international again principally as revenue declines impacted fixed leverage.","About one-third was increased corporate cost in 1Q 2019 as I just covered. The BUs continue to do a very good job managing SG&A. For 1Q, 2019 the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 24.1% in line with our guidance. We continue to expect our calendar year 2019 tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be about 24.5% with 2Q slightly higher than this level.","In 1Q 2019, operating cash flow was $31 million compared to $120 million in 1Q 2018. The decline was driven by the following items several of which are one-time in nature: 1Q 2018 -- in 1Q 2018 Equifax received $35 million in insurance proceeds offsetting costs incurred related to the cybersecurity incident. Equifax received no proceeds in 1Q 2019.","Investments in security and transformation of $97 million were up $18 million on 1Q 2018. Employee variable compensation for 2018 paid in 1Q 2019 exceeded the levels paid in 1Q 2018 for 2017 the year in which no bonuses were paid to the CEO and senior staff by about $15 million. And payments in 1Q 2019 related to the $57 million of charges taken in 4Q 2018 and 1Q 2019 for cost-reduction actions were about $11 million.","Capital spending or the cost of capital projects that was incurred in 1Q 2019 of $95 million was up $38 million from 1Q 2018 as we ramp investment in the cloud capabilities Mark described earlier. The capital spending is aligned with our estimate of $365 million for 2019. Capital expenditures which are equal to capital spending plus the net change in payables related to capital spending were $115 million in 1Q 2019 as activity that completed just prior to year-end was not paid until January.","We do not expect similar large decreases in capital-related payables to occur in the remainder of 2019. The negative free cash flow we saw in the first quarter reflected this high level of capital expenditures. Excluding any payments related to settlements of litigation of regulatory actions as we look forward, we expect to deliver positive free cash flow in each of the remaining quarters of 2019 and for 2019 free cash flow to exceed $200 million.","Now turning to our guidance for 2Q 2019 and 2019. For 2Q 2019, we expect revenue to be $865 million to $880 million, up 0.5% to 2.5% in constant currency. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue by 2.5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be 1.32 to 1.37 per share. FX is expected to impact adjusted EPS negatively by about $0.035 per share.","In February, we provided some perspective on the factors impacting 2019 resulting in an unusual seasonal pattern for Equifax and overall negatively impacting both 1Q and 2Q 2019. Impacting revenue in the first half of 2019 were market factors including the U.S. mortgage markets, Australian credit markets and Argentinian economic weakness and expected GCS revenue declines in the first half.","In February, we had expected that in total these factors would impact 1Q 2019 revenue by about $30 million and would continue to impact revenue in 2Q 2019 although to a lesser degree. In 1Q 2019 although the U.S. mortgage market was about 3% better than expected, GCS which declined about $8 million and to a lesser extent Australia were weaker than expected offsetting this benefit.","In 2Q 2019 in line with our February view, we expect these factors to impact revenue by over $15 million. Again, although the U.S. mortgage market is now expected to only decline slightly, GCS will be down more than previously expected at about the same levels as 1Q 2019.","International is still being impacted by Australian credit market weakness. FX is also negative to revenue versus our February view by about $5 million. Impacting operating profit and EPS in the first half of 2019 were profit impacts of the revenue impacting factors and higher corporate costs in first half 2019 relative to first half 2018. As we indicated in February, the higher corporate costs reflect the significant ramp up in security and related technology costs in 2018 that did not reach their run rate until the second half of 2018.","Also higher equity and variable comp in 2018 relative to 2017 and increased spending on data and analytics. In 1Q 2019, these factors impacted operating profit by approximately $30 million, as expected as lower cost corporate cost increases were offset by greater impact from GCS.","In 2Q 2019, we expect these factors to impact operating profit by over $15 million. Although mortgage market impact will be minimal and much less than anticipated in February, GCS operating profit will have a negative impact that will be greater than expected. Increased corporate costs principally in security and related technology and data and analytics as well as lower Australia operating profit will continue to impact 2Q 2019 as we had expected.","The 2Q 2019 tax rate and interest expense are expected to be consistent with the guidance we provided in February specifically that our 2019 tax rate for adjusted EPS is expected to be just over 24.5% and that quarterly interest expense is expected to be approximately $2 million reflecting our May 2018 bond issue. The combination of the over $15 million impact to operating profit as well as the increased interest expense and expected 24.5% tax rate, principally explain the year-to-year decline in adjusted EPS in the second quarter of 2019.","Our full year 2019 guidance for Equifax revenue and EPS are unchanged from the previous guidance we provided in February with revenue between $3.425 billion $3.525 billion and adjusted EPS between $5.60 and $5.80 per share. Revenue improvements from the acquisition of PayNet and a smaller decline in the U.S. mortgage market are principally offset by a decline in expected GCS revenue, a somewhat deeper decline in the Australian credit markets impacting international revenue and negative FX to revenue of about 0.5% since our February view. This change in revenue mix negative to margin operating profit.","Our actions to manage cost will allow us to maintain our adjusted EPS guidance as well as the year-over-year improvement in BU EBITDA margins. Our guidance for 2019 implies that our second half performance will be stronger than the normal sequential pattern in both revenue and operating profit. This is principally driven by non-mortgage growth in USIS, as well sequential growth across all regions international.","We expect EWS to continue the strong year-to-year growth that they will show in the first half of 2019 into the second half and we expect GCS to return to year-to-year growth in the second half of 2019.","In terms of operating profit, we expect all the use to show stronger than normal sequential operating profit growth in the second half. This is driven by the stronger sequential revenue growth in USIS and international. This is also driven by the cost reductions executed over the last two quarters that will benefit sequential margins in international as well as GCS and workforce. Delivering this performance requires, we continue strong execution across our team as well as continued focus on firmly managing cost throughout 2019.","And with that, operator we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good morning. Mark just first on the legal settlement. Can you just help frame for us the remaining cases? Like is this $690 million basically take care of I don't know 90% of the issues or so forth? Just wanted some color there.","Mark Begor","Yes. Thanks Manav. As you heard me earlier mentioned we're not prepared to talk about which settlements are included here and which are not, but that we were trying to be clear that included the significant issues facing the company our expectation is in the coming weeks as I also mentioned earlier in the call, we'll have some real clarity around that once we finalize the discussions that are actively underway.","John Gambler","And Manav they'll be quite a bit of disclosure in the 10-Q that will be filed later today.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, got it. And then John if I could just follow-up on some color on the guidance in terms of the total M&A contribution. I know Mark just called out PayNet, but what was that contribution from M&A this quarter and then for the full year I guess?","John Gambler","Yes, the contribution for M&A this quarter was relatively small, right? Really the most substantial contribution was DataX and it's less than $5 million in the period. And then we had some other very small acquisitions in international and very small acquisitions in EWS, none of which were material in any way.","Manav Patnaik","And for the full year?","John Gambler","The full year we gave a view for PayNet. As you get into the second half, the substantial impact for Equifax of acquisitions is really just PayNet because we start to wrap around the period in which we bought DataX as we get into early in the third quarter.","Mark Begor","I think I said Manav in my comments that we expect PayNet to add 1.5% to USIS in the second quarter.","Manav Patnaik","Yes, got it. All right. Thank you guys.","Mark Begor","Thanks.","Operator","We'll now hear from George Mihalos with Cowen.","George Mihalos","Hey, good morning, guys. Nice to see the progress on the settlement side. I guess maybe Mark two things to kind of kick it off. First, you sounded upbeat about the pipeline, maybe you can provide a little bit of color if that's vertical -- anything vertical specific or if you're having a lot more success maybe leveraging the workforce and winning new business.","And then understand that financial marketing is probably going to be a bit choppier. But it's nice to see the 6% growth. Should we expect that to be now be positive throughout the course of the year, or will there continue to be some variability?","Mark Begor","Yes, I think on the last one that's one that I tried to be clear in my comments. First-off we were pleased to see that that growth which is really the first growth that we've had since the cyber incident in 2017. Those pipelines are building also, but I would still characterize the pipeline\u2019s there and then broadly in USIS is still building, meaning they're not at full maturity.","We've made great progress as you know go back a year ago we were on hold with many of our customers and that really improved as it went through the year. So, the pipelines broadly as well as in the financial marketing side really started building in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and I tried to give some color that that pipeline is continuing.","And I also highlighted our new leader is -- brought what I would characterize as a new level of energy and focus and accountability with that team as well as commercial engagements. I'm spending a lot of time with customers as does Sid, our new leader. And all the discussions are around growth. Help us with new products. Help us with new ways to grow our business. We want to access Equifax assets. So we're seeing good momentum there and -- but we still expect USIS and financial services to be what I would characterize as choppy, until they get the full maturity around their pipelines, which \u2013 it's hard to predict when that's going to be. We just haven't seen it yet.","George Mihalos","Okay, great. And just as a quick follow-up. If we look at mortgage, I think you talked about this sort of mix shift, if you will, to reseller. Is that secular? Would you expect that to continue over the long-term and is the right way to think about, sort of, a lower revenue per transaction, but sort of a de minimis impact on profitability? Thanks.","John Gambler"," Yeah. So for your second question, that's correct, right? The revenue per transaction is lower, but the level of profit per transaction is relatively similar. Slightly higher in Mortgage Solutions obviously, but relatively similar. And in terms of whether it's a secular trend that's going to continue.","No, I think it's really more market based, right? So it depends on competitive forces in the market. And you've seen our share of Mortgage Solutions go up and down within our portfolio over the years. That will probably continue to happen. Just, right now, we're in a situation where the competitive environment is such that we're better off having more of those sales go through the channel.","Mark Begor"," And there was really one big customer that drove this one situation, which I think we talked about in the fourth quarter and maybe some in the first quarter too, that really drove that change in the revenue. And I don't view it as kind of a secular change. It was really one customer who made that change and we focused on margin.","George Mihalos","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. ","Dave Togut","Thank you. Good morning. Could you provide an update on demand trends from the other major drivers of U.S. consumer credit services like auto and credit card, for example? And then, just as a follow-up. If you could update us on your progress with trended data. How you're doing in your existing verticals? And then, are there some new verticals that you could enter with trended data in the future?","Mark Begor","Yeah. In terms of the overall market performance, we haven't seen much of a change really. I think you've probably seen that from what the banks have announced, right? Over the last several quarters, we're continuing to see the same trends that we saw in the fourth quarter continuing into the first quarter in the card market.","In the auto market, you're seeing \u2013 you might be \u2013 you're starting to see delinquencies pick up a little bit in sub-prime, but that really tends to be relatively localized, we believe, and you are actually seeing the overall credit quality we think of the entire auto portfolio actually improving. So \u2013 but generally speaking, the trends in the markets we serve, as you mentioned, other than mortgage we think are relatively consistent with what we saw late last year.","Dave Togut","And then trended? ","Mark Begor","Sure. Trended data, I think, what \u2013 trended data is a key part of what we're trying to deploy and we continue to expand our product focus on trended data. I think, probably the most important thing, as Mark indicated, is as we move more and more to the data fabric, you'll see an increasing number of products that are focused on trended information.","We still think we're the only party out there with trended commercial products, which will certainly extend now that we've acquired PayNet and it's something that we continue to expand in our portfolio. It isn't the driver behind our NPI, but it is an option \u2013 it is something that we're focused on in NPI. ","Dave Togut","Understood. Thank you very much.","Mark Begor","Thanks.","Operator","We will now hear from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. This is Andrew. I wanted to ask about visibility in the USIS. I definitely heard you talked about the new leadership and the growing pipeline and the new level of energy. But could you give us a sense of how much revenue visibility you have now versus six months ago in USIS? And I mean that separate from any mortgage dynamic.","Mark Begor","Yes. Maybe I'll start John then you can jump in. Yes, Andrew, you put a great mark around there. You go back six months ago, it's probably good mark to look back on. There's no question our revenue visibility has increased dramatically in how we can look through in USIS versus where we were last summer. That visibility has improved as we went through the fourth quarter and certainly into the first.","We are still trying to be clear with you and our other investors and analysts that while that visibility is getting stronger, which one metric for that is our pipelines and how they're growing and how they've been rebuilding, it's still not back to where it was before the cyber incident USIS.","That's really the business where that's still moving forward. So I would say a lot more visibly that we had six months ago. And part of that is it gives us the confidence in our comments around guidance for both second quarter and as well as the second half. I think as you know, we're showing the second half of this year improving on a year-over-year basis at a faster rate than the first half and we're doing that based on our confidence and our visibility. Would you add John?","John Gambler","I think Mark covered it all, right? But the fact is I think we're starting to see more consistency in terms of delivery versus near-term forecast, right? And that gives us comfort that the visibility that we believe we have as we look forward is starting to improve. It's not what it was two years ago, but the accuracy of our forecast versus delivery is certainly getting better.","Mark Begor","I think we mentioned Andrew that in the first quarter USIS was slightly above our expectations, which those are the kind of signs we're looking to see. Meaning that the teams says they're going to deliver something and they deliver it that gives us more confidence that they have the visibility and we have it also.","Dave Togut","Right. I appreciate it.","Mark Begor","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. Good morning. A question for you John. You mentioned the $200 million free cash flow guidance for the year and you have a cash balance right now of $133 million. And so just looking at the size of the after-tax accrual you're making I guess what's the timeline for paying the cash for the losses?","And are you planning on raising debt? I'm assuming maybe not because the interest expense incorporated in the guidance didn't go up. So I just wanted to hear about that. And also does the settlement mean that you'll resume buybacks at this point or you're going to wait until the litigation is in the clear? Thank you.","John Gambler","Yes. So in terms of the timing of any payments I think we need to complete the discussions as Mark mentioned. So when that's done, we'll have a lot more clarity on that. But the payments are likely some time in the future and our expectation is that we'll be borrowing to make any payments that we made. So that is our expectation.","Mark Begor","And the second half of your question about buyback or dividend, we're not prepared to make -- have any discussions about what our plans are in that front yet. We need to finalize these discussions as John pointed out finalize the timing of the payments. We've been clear with you and other investors that we also want to see some clarity on the USIS recovery which is positive, but still not as predictable as we would like.","And then the other leg on that chair about our capital allocation plan is around the EFX 2020 technology investment that we're in the middle of and we want to see a little more visibility on kind of schedule and delivery on that. So, a long winded answer around a question around stock buyback or dividend that's the discussion that we'll be having in the future with you. We're not ready to have that today.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. Very helpful. And then just wanted to ask a bit about sentiments during the quarter. It sounds like you're happy with the growth and the new business starting to come back. Just wanted to also -- just sort of get a sense of a competitor of yours mentioned maybe some client caution after the fourth quarter market volatility. So, did you see that as well, and just wanted to hear about your sense on what's going on with the industry and the clients. Thank you. ","Mark Begor","Yeah. No, haven't seen those kind of dialogues around you characterized client caution. We have seen an increased dialogue with our customers around their work and we're partnering with them to do that about preparing for a potential economic slowdown. And what that really means, as you know, some of their focus around data assets changes to line management, credit line decreases, credit and collections a different focus on underwriting.","So we've have got a number of customer dialogues going about wanting to work with us to be prepared for a potential economic slowdown. I don't think anyone is predicting it, but I would say that's a change for me in the last three, four, five months than it was kind of the middle of last year where that dialogue has been added to their kind of growth dialogue.","Toni Kaplan","Perfect. Thanks, a lot, Mark.","Operator","We will now hear from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thanks. Hey, congrats on shifting that first Canadian customer to the cloud. Just any thoughts as to kind of the guidepost on that and what it can ultimately mean for the USIS business overall? And is there a way to maybe just frame that out within the context to the U.S. transformation?","Mark Begor","Yeah. I assume you're referring, Kevin, to the like the benefits of speed to market and cost savings and all that stuff. If that's where you're heading we're working on that. We're going to be prepared to share that in the future with you and our investors. We're not ready to do that yet. But we try to be quite clear that we view this investment not only for USIS, but what we're doing around the globe as being transformational.","We think it's going to differentiate us from our competitors. It's something that will be hard for our competitors to do at the same pace were doing. And we're seeing -- there is clear cost benefits of cloud versus legacy. There's clear stability reliability benefits. Meaning our focus is to move to always on versus 3 9s, 5 9s, 5 9s of stability. In today's world that's critically important.","And then the speed to market, the ability to get products to market or in just data assets in weeks versus months is going to be another will benefit. So we continue to be energized about what it's going to deliver, and we know we've got a plan and the requirement to really share with you guys some clarity around those benefits. And I think that'll certainly come to the table when we're ready to put our long-term framework back in place.","I think that's the time that we'll share some real visibility about not only our view of Equifax for the future, but the view of Equifax, including our investment in technology and security through EFX2020. ","John Gamble","And I think we said previously that in both cost of sales and then also our development expense that we would expect to see the type of savings that you've seen from other companies that have moved from the cloud. So, we've seen savings that are double-digits in percentages and we would expect to be able to deliver those types of savings. ","Kevin McVeigh","Super, helpful. And then just any initial thoughts on the reception to the FICO partnership from a client perspective?","Mark Begor","Yes. It's a great question. It's quite positive. We made the announcement back in March and we were working with FICO for about six months on this and start talking to customers really in the fourth quarter about it. And between us and FICO, we got a pipeline of I don't know a couple of dozen customers that are really energized about it.","But the feedback is quite positive from customers about this is an option. Customer still want to buy from FICO directly. They want to buy from Equifax directly. But there's a set of customers that are really energized about the benefits that come from an integrated solution of FICO's software assets and Equifax' Ignite + InterConnect and differentiated data assets. So we're energized about it as we roll through the second quarter and into the second half.","Kevin McVeigh","Super. Congrats.","Mark Begor","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier comment about trends in regards to FMS. So FMS is essentially batch downloads both for marketing as well as decisioning. Have you seen a better demand on one versus another or any particular verticals where you have seen trend? Thanks.","John Gamble","So our Financial Marketing Services business is principally CMS. If I don't cover your question, sorry, but it's principally CMS. And we saw nice growth in CMS this quarter. CMS is really consistent with the normal type of products that you'd see go into credit marketing services of a financial institution.","So we don't sell anything particularly different than that. We have seen an expansion into a new customer base. We started to start selling into consulting firms and some other firms that also can utilize our data for appropriate reasons. So we're starting to see an expansion of the customer base. But other than that no trends that are different than normal.","Ashish Sabadra","That's good. That's good. And then maybe just quickly on GCS. I understand the results, they have changed slightly below expectations. But as you look forward, are there anything on the strategic front that you're planning to do in order to improve the growth there?","John Gamble","Yes. There's really two efforts there. One is on our partner business. As you know, we've got relationships with Credit Karma Life Lock and others like that. So continued growth there and that's performing well that side of the business. On the core D2C business, direct-to-consumer, we're both accelerating our advertising. So that's going to help grow our subscriber growth there.","But the real game changer for us is the big investment we're making in our technology, our Renaissance platform that's going to allow us to do things like cross-selling and other things with the business that we think will help later in the year and particularly in 2020. So that's some of the things that the team is working on in GCS.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks. That's helpful.","Operator","And we will now hear from Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Tim McHugh","Yes. Just wanted to follow-up on some of the technology comments you made in the prepared remarks. One I think there's a comment that the move to the data fabric is slightly later than you thought. I guess, is that I guess elaborate on why that is?","And then secondly, you talked about the target of trying to migrate half of the customers onto InterConnect the cloud version by the end of the year. How does -- as you plan for that I guess how disruptive is that to the clients? What's the approach you're using as you migrate people? And kind of what's the profile of people migrating this year versus next year? Thanks.","Mark Begor","Yes. So maybe on the first one. Obviously this is a big project that we're doing and we're going to have slight delay. This was delayed by -- weeks or whatever. And that's going to happen and we just want to be transparent with you that we're working on it. And when we have something that's a little bit behind we'll share it with you. And when we're ahead we'll do the same thing. So we don't do that as a big issue. But it's just a level of transparency that we want to have because of the scale of the investment.","With regards to the customer piece our goal and what we work on is to make this as easy as possible. But as you know these are never easy. Each customer has their own technology department. And we've done this before and we do it all the time and it's one that you just have to be open and transparent with the customer. You got to be visible with them. We got to work around their schedule make sure it works on where they want to do it. But our goal is to make it as frictionless as possible for them. But there's always work that they have to do when you make these transformations. ","John Gamble","The team has done a nice job of putting the customers in categories. We have some customers where the impact on them will be relatively minor because they use gateways more than anything else. So that's a relatively small lift for them and quite straightforward. Other customers that use our decisioning very heavily we actually manage the decisioning system for them. So in that case we can do most of the work. And for them it's mostly testing which isn't a nothing lift. But it's -- but we can try to take a lot of the heavylifting ourselves.","And then with the kind of the rest of the customers which is a large group of customers, the team has done a really great job of building out standard solution architecture sets that they can help the customers deploy more rapidly and that should actually give them more functionality than they have today.","So it's not just the migration per saying, it's the migration that gets them more and gets them on to a standard product set that will allow them to actually extend the usage of the product and we're going to build on that as we go forward and that's a promise we're making to the customer. So I think they have a very good plan that's structured well and that they're progressing on. ","Tim McHugh","Those customers that you're starting, or you mentioned, should I think of those as the simpler ones that you want to start with? Or are they bigger or smaller customers? Anything about the kind of the initial cohort? ","John Gamble","Actually it's done as Mark said based on when the customer's ready to engage. So a lot of the smaller ones occurred that's certainly true because that's more within our control, but there's also substantial customers where we're also working on migration already. So it's really depending on when the customer is ready to receive the work. ","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. ","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi. Good morning. Appreciate taking the question. I wondered if I could just drill down a little bit on the commentary in USIS about visibility. Mark, you mentioned, I think you referenced delivery timing from sort of customer engagement to delivery. What about close rates? I mean when you start your sales cycle I guess to close rate from engagement to actually getting the customer to commit I mean has that changed at all? And mean how much of the improvement that you're anticipating as a function of customer behavior versus Equifax\u2019 ability in timing and delivery? ","Mark Begor","John, you want? ","John Gambler","Sure. So I think what I -- Mark kind of mentioned timing which is certainly important right? And that's really what's going on now. As we continue to build in the funnel and there's more opportunities available, our comfort with our ability to close within the funnel which is now larger is improving, right? So to us timing of closure and rate of closure are very similar, because they're just separated in time, right? And we continue to focus and Sid and team has done a great job of focusing on just building the funnel, so that if the timing is variable which it has been and continues to be and is more variable than it used to be.","That's all still true. But as we continue to build the funnel to have more opportunities, we're getting more comfortable that we're able to deliver our forecasts, because we have greater opportunities to deliver. So, I really -- I don't think it's really in any more complicated than that. And as the funnels continue to feel better, we get more comfortable with delivery. And quite honestly, as months pass and we deliver on the numbers that we commit to ourselves, we get more comfortable as well. And that's really what's going on. And you're still choppy.","Mark Begor","And you go back to fourth quarter, like USIS was kind of where we thought they are where we should be and where they committed to be. And we saw that again in the first quarter. They were actually a little bit ahead of our expectations. So that kind of a track record gives us confidence that all the things you're talking about are happening. Close rates are getting more predictable and pipelines are building. But it's -- we still remain cautious. It's only a couple of quarters in here of that kind of a track record.","John Gamble","And the choppiness is still there. We don't want to -- have you think that it's not. It's still there. And certainly there could be period where things that don't occur the way we expect, because the pipeline isn't as big as normal. We could still end up with an unexpected outcome. So it's better, but it's not different than what we said a quarter ago.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, with regard to sort of your broad FinTech facing solutions and position in the market. Could you just sort of characterize where you think you are competitively and whether there's -- whether you'd anticipate a ramp sort of generally speaking in FinTech end market?","Mark Begor","I think we've talked in -- yeah, I think we've talked in the past that this is a space that you go back as recently as a year ago or late 2017, we weren't as focused on FinTech as we should have been. I think that's an understatement. I think it's clear our competitors are much stronger. We have a great market position with the FinTechs with Workforce Solutions. A lot of the FinTechs are using The Work Number. So that's a strong market position. But if you look at our overall share in FinTech, it's quite small.","And we talked last year -- I think mid-last year we doubled our commercial team in FinTech. We've got real pipelines now of dialogues with FinTechs. I've met with a bunch of them personally. And the dialogues with them are really quite positive about the fact that we had differentiated data. Work Number is one. Our credit file is another one. NCTUE, the utilities cellphone database. So the dialogues are quite positive. And we would expect to see FinTech grow from a fairly small level where it is today as we go through the rest of this year and into next year. We are really focused on getting into FinTech and being a bigger player there.","Andrew Jeffrey","Right. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now hear from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess, the first question. Just how should we think about the risk of customers pushing out signing your business until after the tech transformation is complete? And are you hearing that feedback, hey, it sounds good. But like let's wait and see you get your house in order before we sign on rather than coming on board amid the migrations and everything?","Mark Begor","Yeah. Zero. Don't hear anything on that. The term house in order, we look at it our house is in order. Meaning, our technology is sound. It works and I don't have to remind you. You go back to last year, before the cybersecurity breach, our technology was working fine. It still does today. We're taking advantage of our big investment in security to really transform our technology. And the dialogues of customers is really -- they're quite positive.","They look at it, well this is the partner I want to be with, if they're going to make this kind of investment in their technology. And you couple that with our differentiated data assets, the discussions are very positive. So we don't have any customers saying well we're going to hold off. They are really quite energized. When I sit with them and talk about the commitment we have to them through this technology investment, the dialogue is we want to be partners with you guys. So that's kind of how -- what I'm hearing in the marketplace.","John Gambler","We have customers who want to work with us to help us do this faster, so we can help them, right?","Mark Begor","Totally.","John Gambler","It's a very positive thing.","Mark Begor","Well the other thing is most of our customers, we have a few that are quite advanced on the cloud but very few. And those customers see what we're doing, the amount of investment we're making. And our technology teams are increasingly engaging with their technology teams about their own cloud transformation. And they want to learn from us. They want to follow what we're doing.","So that's another element of the dialogue. And the same thing happens to security. We\u2019re obviously have a commitment to be an industry leader in security. We made massive investments in the last 18 months in security and that's another dialogue with the technology teams about what are you guys doing around security so we can learn from that.","Andrew Jeffrey","Great. Thanks. And then just the second, the follow-up. You talked a lot about the savings you expect to get from the transformation over the next several years. I guess at this point, do you have a view on how much you'd likely let fall to the bottom line versus is there maybe a view that stepping up innovation spending or some other to drive the top line would be a way to reinvest meaningful portion of the savings?","Mark Begor","Yes. It's hard for me Gary to talk about the technology savings. I think we'll get to that when we put our long-term framework back in place. But I think you see us making decisions now and we have in the last six, 12 months around investment decisions. We did our fairly significant restructuring in the fourth quarter and took some of those cost savings to the bottom line. But we also plowed savings back into more commercial resources. We plowed savings back into more DNA resources. We're obviously investing a ton in technology. We're very visible on that in security.","And then NPI and new products has been and continues to be a priority for us where we're continuing to make significant investments. And we give you visibility on the new products we're rolling out to the marketplace. And some of that new product work is coming through our technology transformation. So we're investing in the future today. And what we do with the benefits from our technology and security investments I think we'll talk about that when we get to our long-term financial framework.","Andrew Jeffrey","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Mark Begor","Hi, Bill.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. So first congratulations to Mark on hitting the one-year mark and on settlement. So first question for you is on the price increase that FICO put through this year starting January 1. They -- that's going to phase in throughout 2019. Equifax is a big player in auto. And I was hoping you could help us understand how that could potentially help USIS in the second half.","Mark Begor","John, you want?","John Gambler","Yes. So, obviously, the FICO price increase impacts us. It impacts our customers. We pass it through to our customers and it will impact both revenue and margin. It's kind of a very similar story to what we had last year with the price increase related to mortgage. So, it's really no different than that.","In terms of magnitude, we don't give specific numbers in terms of the magnitude of dollars of that occur with the partner. But it'll be very similar in concept to what happened with mortgage, just much smaller.","Bill Warmington","Got it. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there was potential for you to work with FICO in some new ways in the near future. I was hoping you could expand on that.","Mark Begor","Yes, I don't think we're ready, Bill, to talk about those. We've got -- because of those partnership kind of structural umbrella that we created. We're in kind of constant dialogues with Will Lansing and his team in different ways that we might work together. We're seeing some new things that were kind of percolating on that could be beneficial for us and FICO.","I'm a big believer in leveraging our strengths with another companies through partnerships. And this is an example of where we're trying to exercise that muscle and find ways to do things that are going to benefit us FICO and our joint or new customers. So, stay tuned, I guess, is the right answer.","Bill Warmington","All right. Well, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Hi thanks. Good morning. You've indicated that you're still cautious around the pace of recovery of USIS, but are confident that the business will get back to traditional growth levels over the long-term. Can you discuss any structural factors that may be holding you back from formally reinstating your long-term growth targets?","Mark Begor","You got two different questions in there. I think George, on the long-term growth targets, we've been very clear with you and others that we certainly intend to put long-term growth framework to move back in place.","We've been clear that there were a number of things we wanted to see some clarity on. One was our legal and regulatory settlement which we made progress there but that's not complete yet. Second was on our technology transformation. And again we're making progress on that and we want some more visibility there.","And third was on USIS which may be a part of your question, we want to see some stability in the recovery. And we're kind of a couple of quarters into say due meaning they're delivering where we thought they were going to deliver. And we want to see some continued performance as well as sequential growth there. And those are kind of the three things that John and I in the leadership team think about before we're going to put a long-term framework in place.","And we continue to be confident that not only USIS, but Equifax will recover to where it was pre-breach and that confidence comes from our discussions with customers, our growing pipeline, our differentiated data assets, all those we think are going to allow us to return. I don't see anything structural. It's just a matter of time. And we're seeing some positive progress in the first quarter. We expect that to continue in the second quarter and as well through the rest of the year.","George Tong","Got it, that's helpful. And turning to the pipeline, specifically in USIS, it sounds like the pipeline is still building and not yet back to full maturity. Can you talk about how quickly the pipeline is growing and what changes to the salesforce you may have made to drive better and faster close rates?","Mark Begor","Well, on the salesforce, we continue to energize our sales team or incenting them and there are some new talent coming in. Obviously, we have a new leader in the business now, which I'm quite energized about the last 60 days, under Sid's leadership. In regards to the pipeline building, I don't have any metrics, John?","John Gambler","We don't disclose pipeline metrics, so.","Mark Begor","But we try to give visibility and just maybe more anecdotally here that John and I are seeing those pipelines build and the evidence for you is USIS delivering what they -- what we commit that they're going to do, and we've done that for couple of quarters and we want that to continue.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now hear from Brett Huff with Stephens.","Brett Huff","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions for me. One, can you talk a little bit about PayNet? I want to make sure I understand that it's 150 basis points in 2Q on USIS help or total company help? I guess that's just a housekeeping question.","Mark Begor","USIS.","Brett Huff","Okay. And then was that originally in the guide? I don't think it was. So is there something else in the guide, is it Australia that's a little bit more muted? Is there an offset to that inorganic help that we didn't raise our overall guidance for? Or is it just kind of conservatism?","John Gambler","Yeah. So for the full -- you wanted the full year?","Brett Huff","Yes.","John Gambler","So the full year, PayNet was a plus, exclusive with the mortgage market would be better, would be less bad than we had indicated initially. And then with the weakness is GCS is a bit weaker than we said and initially back in February than we thought. And FX was quite a bit more negative than we thought, right? We said 0.5 point of growth were being impacted by FX, and probably the smallest of the three is -- Australia is a bit weaker but that isn't the driver.","Brett Huff","Okay. And that's super helpful. And then on the migrations that are happening congrats on the remarkable pace you guys are going to take up on that with half, I think the USIS being done in 2019. Once that starts and -- have we done a couple of trials? Or are we right in the middle of that? Or kind of what -- do we have early results on smaller clients be moved over or how do you kind of feel about that?","John Gambler","So we currently have moved -- we're not going to give numbers as we go. But we're well into the migration. It's still early days. So -- but the team has moved to substantial number of clients on to cloud fabrics. So that's -- we think that's going well. And the migrations are going on to InterConnect SaaS. And initially things move on to the -- to our private cloud and then they'll move on to the public private cloud as things move forward. But that migration is going well and that last step is simple. So we feel very good about how things are progressing and that the team is working really well.","Brett Huff","Great. Appreciate the insights.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Trevor Burns","No further comments. Just thanks everybody for participating in the call and appreciate your time. Thank you.","Operator","Again that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8686":["Equifax (NYSE:EFX) Q4 2012 Earnings Call February  7, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Richard F.

Incorporated, Research Division","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Q4 2012 Equifax Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations, and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab on our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2011 Form 10-K and subsequent filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin.","Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes the CSC acquisition fees, a pension settlement which we announced during the quarter, certain income tax items, the loss on the deconsolidation of our Brazilian business and acquisition-related amortization expense.","Adjusted operating margin excludes the CSC acquisition fees and the pension settlement, which was a noncash charge. These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation in our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section, under the About Equifax tab on our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe it's already been 2 months since we were with many of you at New York Stock Exchange. Hopefully, you found that a great opportunity to see our management team first hand, get a better understanding of our strategy and some of our key growth initiatives. Based upon your feedback, it appears the insight and outlook we provided you was viewed positive. We're excited about the growth opportunities that lie ahead. We want to thank you again for your time and your interest in our company. As you know, we have been intensely focused on the rapid deployment of innovation and the continuous strive to improve our execution. Our performance for this quarter and for the year reflects that effort.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, total revenue was $558 million, up 9.5% from the fourth quarter of 2011. The adjusted operating margin was 24.9% compared to 24.7% in 2011, up 20 basis points. And finally, the adjusted EPS was $0.78, up 14% from $0.68 a year ago. Across many dimensions, 2012 was a record year for Equifax. For the first time in our history, we surpassed $2 billion in revenue. We added over $1.8 billion in market value, and we closed the acquisition of our largest and last affiliate in the United States, CSC Credit Services. And we broadened our product offerings, we also expanded our global presence. All in all, a good year.","Each of our business units has some very noteworthy accomplishments in 2012. We expect their success last year to fuel the momentum in 2013. For the year, USCIS delivered 16% revenue growth and expanded operating margins by over 100 basis points. A couple of highlights for USCIS, we formalized our enterprise-wide distribution process, leveraging the scale, skill and scope of USCIS customer relationships that still services by Workforce Solutions, North American Commercial Solutions and North American Personal Solutions. So I could tell you firsthand that the traction that it's gained and the difference it's made in the marketplace is significant and of great value for our customers, too.","Secondly, in USCIS, we expanded our key client program, something we introduced a number of years ago. We have 2 new clients under Tom Madison's leadership, and we strengthened the management team with both outside hires and internal promotions.","We also took this model, this KCP Service Model, into new verticals, specifically the telco market to better address the needs of a very large and important market segment to us. Also in USCIS, we expanded our Decision 360 strategy and it's delivering significant wins in the marketplace, as we demonstrate and differentiate the value of the unique insights we bring to our customers' critical decisioning needs. That will continue to be a great focus for us in 2013 and beyond, as well.","International. Excluding the results of Brazil in 2011, International delivered solid constant dollar organic growth of 9% while maintaining 30% operating margins and further penetrating our key markets with new products and services. Here's a handful of highlights. We continue to leverage our strong franchise in key geographies with new product innovation, growth of our analytics and enabling technology services, broadening our served markets and increasing the scale of operations through better IT and organizational discipline. Despite really weak economies, our U.K. and Spanish management teams relentlessly executed on their strategic initiatives, enabling us to gain market share and deliver a 10% local currency growth in revenue for the year.","In Latin America, our high-value offerings in technology and analytical services grew over 25% in 2012. That has been a key area of focus for us now for a number of years across International but specifically in Latin America. In Russia, overall volume growth and new product offerings contributed to a very strong double-digit revenue growth. And in India, we continue to exceed our targets for new contributing members and records in the database, which significantly enhances our value of our strategic investments in new products and analytical capabilities. In fact, in India now, we have over 200 million records and over 200 different data contributors, so again some great momentum in India.","On the Workforce Solutions, they had a great year, growing 15% and expanding their operating margins by almost 100 basis points. This was driven primarily by a 34% increase in verification services. At year end, total records in the Work Number database were over 222 million, up 6% from year-end 2011, on a clear path to reach 70 million active records and 250 million total records. This expansion of records will fuel growth for a number of years ahead.","We will further penetrate our served markets by using new product innovation to add new value to those records and through our enterprise selling initiatives. Workforce Solutions is gaining traction within the financial services, specifically the credit card and automotive verticals, addressing their needs of the build and pay underwriting requirements. And we've talked about that for quite some time, really taking the Work Number database beyond just mortgage in a new market. So the credit card and automotive verticals are paying great dividends already. Additionally, Workforce Solutions continues to broaden its focus in the government sector, with public agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to support their efforts to reduce improper payments and improve agency services and staff efficiency.","Personal Solutions had an outstanding year with 13% revenue growth, a strong 30% operating margin and significant market share gains. Due to new product launches such as Equifax Complete, subscription-based revenue grew 16%, and the average revenue per subscriber was increased by 12% from 2011.","We also increased our U.S. based platform and marketing expertise and brought it to Canada and European operations to accelerate their opportunities with consumers. As a result, U.K.'s personal solutions product delivered strong double-digit growth and significant market share gains in 2012. The success that Trey [ph] and his team have had by taking these capabilities and bringing them in a stronger fashion to Canada and a new fashion to U.K., has given us great hope that we're going to in fact take the same approach to other countries around the world and build a Personal Solutions business.","North American Commercial Solutions, as we talked throughout last year, faced a challenging 2012 with weak market conditions, the constrained growth and pressured operating margins. For the year, revenue grew 1% and the operating margin was 22%. High-single digit growth in our U.S. Risk segment offset weaknesses in our U.S. marketing and also Canada. However, they turned the corner in the fourth quarter and delivered 4% growth with continued strength in U.S. Risk and improved performance from U.S. marketing. Commercial strategy to penetrate new markets is starting to build momentum, with the pipeline for new business up 45% at the end of 2012 versus 2011.","One of the processes we go through on a routine basis is to review our portfolio. When we determine that a business no longer fits our long-term strategy, we obviously are going to take a divestment strategy. So over the past week, we have divested 2 small, nonstrategic business units. One is Settlement Services, which was partly started and built a number of years ago in USCIS, and the other, Talent Management in Workforce Solutions. It's a win for us, it's a win for the buyers and it's going to be a win for the customers and our employees, as well. Combined, these units generated $800 million in revenue last year at margins that were below the Equifax average.","Beginning this quarter, first quarter 2013, these units will be treated as discontinued operations. I should point out that the financial impact of these divestitures to total company earnings per share is nominal and was fully anticipated when we presented the 2013 guidance during our Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange in December.","I'm proud of the performance the team delivered in 2012. Some additional highlights: our new product innovation process launched over 60 new products, including some insurance scores in the U.K., family plan and Personal Solutions and many others. We have now launched over 60 products per year for 5 consecutive years. We expanded our served markets in Workforce Solutions, as I mentioned, by introducing products that target the auto and the card markets. We continue to [indiscernible] and other world-class processes to better control our cost, improve operating margin and strengthen our market position. In fact, our reputation and expertise in the area of LEAN and process improvement is being recognized by our customers. Increasingly, customers are asking for our help in deploying LEAN in their operations to improve productivity within and across our respective organizations.","A quick look forward. Our focus in 2013 will build on the momentum we created in 2012. A few points for you. Although it's only been 6 weeks, we're off to a really good start with the integration of CSC Credit Services. It will be known, by the way, in the future as our central region within our FSC organization, which had no problems to date, and we fully anticipate a smooth, quick and successful integration.","We will continue to leverage Decision 360, expanding and broadening our product services to gain market share. We'll step up our investment analytics and look for capabilities to further increase the value of our insights to our customers. We intend to accelerate growth in our fast-growing Fraud and ID Management business. We will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire or leverage new and unique data resources, including unstructured data. We'll do this through internal development, acquisitions and partnerships. And to ensure that we can support these growth initiatives, we'll continue to invest in critical infrastructure initiatives, such as building platforms, human resources and a standardized international systems platform.","I can tell you this, and hopefully you saw it in December. The energy our team has around these opportunities of growth in front of us are exciting, and their desire to win is extremely encouraging. So with that, I'll turn it over to Lee for a deeper financial look at 2012. Lee?","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will be referring to the financial results generally presented on a GAAP basis. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.","As Rick mentioned, after year end, we divested 2 business units: Settlement Services in USCIS and Talent Management in Workforce Solutions. The financial results of these 2 businesses are included in our reported fourth quarter results, as we had not made firm decisions to proceed with these divestitures until after quarter end.","However, these 2 businesses will be reported as discontinued operations beginning with the first quarter of 2013. To facilitate your modeling for 2013, we have included the impact of these divestitures on their respective segments and total company for the full year 2011 and '12, and quarterly for 2012, in a table included with our earnings release.","Now let me return to the quarterly results. Compared to the same quarter of 2011, for the fourth quarter of 2012, consolidated revenue of $558 million was up 9.5% on a reported and constant currency basis. Operating margin was 17%, which was negatively impacted by a non-cash settlement -- pension settlement and fees associated with the CSC acquisition. Excluding these onetime items, the adjusted operating margin was 24.9%, up from 24.7% in 2011.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.38. During the quarter, we recorded several one-time items, which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation. The cumulative impact of these onetime items negatively impacted GAAP EPS by approximately $0.27.","Adjusting for the onetime items and excluding acquisition-related amortization, adjusted earnings per share was $0.78, up $0.10 or 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. This includes approximately $0.02 per share of tax benefits and 3 days' results of operations from the CSC Credit Services acquisition, which closed on December 28.","Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $236 million, up 9%. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $148 million, up 8%. A majority of this growth came from a combination of increased volume and improved pricing in mortgage and auto end-use markets, while the remainder came from pricing and new product initiatives in other end-use markets, partially offset by declines in transaction volume from select high volume but lower unit priced accounts in the financial services market.","Average revenue per transaction was up 17% in the quarter, due to the shift in transaction mix toward higher-priced units and away from lower unit price accounts and to increased revenue from subscription-billed products.","Transaction volume was down 9% due to shift away from high volume but lower-priced accounts. Mortgage Solutions revenue of $43 million was up 28% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Both mortgage reporting and Settlement Services delivered strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Our Undisclosed Debt Monitoring Services continued to deliver strong double-digit growth as we had several new customers and broadened our distribution channels.","Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $45 million, down 1%. Credit Marketing Services revenue was up approximately 7%, while IXI declined as financial institutions reduced their use of wealth-based data in select applications due to regulatory uncertainty, which we are now addressing.","The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 37.4% compared to 37.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Our International business unit's revenue was $125 million, up 7% on a reported and constant dollar basis. By region, Latin America's revenue was $48 million, up 8% in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency, driven by strong double-digit growth in analytical services and marketing services.","Europe's revenue was $44 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in local currency. Strong double-digit growth in Analytical Services and Personal Solutions helped to offset a decline in our consumer and commercial online information offerings, which continue to be impacted by weak economic conditions.","Canada consumer information revenue was $33 million, up 10% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. Strength in Analytical services, particularly in Fraud Services, helped to offset weaknesses in Consumer Information Solutions.","International's operating margin was 29.8%, up from 28.7% in 2011. Equifax Workforce Solutions revenue was $117 million in the quarter, up 11%. Verification Services, with revenue of $70 million, was up 27% for the quarter, driven by strong double-digit growth in mortgage, preemployment, government and auto markets.","Active employment records increased 6% over the prior-year period and combined with product innovation and end-user market penetration to drive strong, continuing growth.","Employer Services revenue was $48 million, down 6% compared to last year, resulting from continued softness in tax management services, reflecting lower unemployment compensation claims activity and a delay in renewing work opportunity tax credits by the federal government, which were not renewed until January.","The Workforce Solutions' operating margin was 22.4%, compared to 23.2% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Since the federal government had not renewed the work opportunity tax credit program, we could not report revenue even though we continue to perform the necessary work for our customers. With the resolution of the fiscal cliff negotiations, work opportunity tax credit program has been extended, and we can now record revenue-associated work completed in the fourth quarter.","Our North America Personal Solutions revenue was $53 million for the quarter, up 16%. Strong growth in our subscription revenue, the additional penetration in Canada and breach activity were the major contributors to this performance. Operating margin was 30.1% compared to 30.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011, reflecting increased marketing activity in driving new subscribers.","North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $28 million, up 4% on a reported and local currency basis. Strong growth in our U.S. risk segment was partially offset by weakness in Canada and our U.S. marketing activities. The operating margin was 34.4%, flat when compared to the year-ago quarter.","In 2013, we'll be making some adjustments to the USCIS and Personal Solutions, which do not impact the reported results of the total company. However, they will impact your modeling and our reported results for these 2 business segments in 2013. First, we have aligned some of our wholesale accounts to be consistent with the current organizational accountability. As a result, the revenue and expense from these accounts will be transferred from Personal Solutions to USCIS.","Since this changes the reported results for these 2 units, we have included the impact retroactively for the full year 2011 and the quarterly and full year impact of 2012 in the attachment to our earnings release. Additionally, CSC acquisition, Personal Solutions, will realize some expense synergies beginning in 2013. As a result, we continue to expect the operating margin trend for Personal Solutions to be consistent with what we presented during the Investor Day at the New York Stock Exchange.","For the full year, consolidated revenue of $2.2 billion in 2012 was up 10% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant currency basis. Excluding Brazil, a non-GAAP measure, full year revenue was up 12%. Operating margin was 22.6%, which was negatively impacted by the noncash pension settlement and fees associated with the CSC acquisition. Excluding these onetime items, adjusted operating margin was 24.7%, up from 24% in 2011.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax is $2.22. On a non-GAAP basis, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.97, up 18% from the prior year. Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Great. Thanks, Lee. Some quick comments about the full year of 2013 and the quarter, then we'll go to questions. Back in December, during our Investor Day, we outlined 2013 and gave you an outlook. We talked about 10% to 12% revenue growth, 20% to 25% growth in adjusted earnings per share and operating margin in the range of 26% to 27%. We also indicated that we expected the mortgage market to remain relatively strong through the first half of 2013, but then down 15% for the full year.","We also described an economic environment where we expected modest U.S. GDP growth of around 2% and sluggish global GDP growth of approximately 2.4%. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver 2013 results within those ranges outlined in December. For the full year, excluding the impact of the recent -- including the impact of the recent dispositions that we've talked about, our expectation for adjusted EPS from continuing operations is between $3.56 and $3.64 a share.","For the first quarter, assuming the current exchange rates and the continuation of the mortgage activity we experienced this past quarter, our outlook for revenue growth from continuing operations is between 10% and 12%. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be between $0.84 and $0.87 per share for the quarter, up 20%, 24% from the first quarter of 2012. The negative impact in the first quarter from the 2 disposed businesses that we talked about, ESS and Talent Management, is approximately $0.01 for the quarter. So with that, operator, I'd like to open up for any questions or comments.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","In the fourth quarter, the business segments with the strongest organic growth tended to show flat to down EBIT margins, whereas the slowest growing business, International, actually posted the best year-over-year margin gains. Can you maybe shed some light on why, and how should we think about business segment margins for 2013?","Lee Adrean","Sure, David. I think we've said for a while, we certainly worked to drive consistent margin performance on a total company basis, but it's very easy to see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in individual businesses. USCIS was down 10 basis points year-over-year. We are making some investments in our fraud product lines there, where we see good opportunity. And given the size of business, and it's our biggest, but you spend $0.5 million or $1 million of additional investment a quarter and it's 20, 40 basis points. So that pretty readily can explain quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. So we don't really focus on individual business unit quarterly margins, so much is trends over a longer period. We do focus at a total company level of ensuring that we're delivering consistent performance. Our expectations on margins for next year across the business units continue to be consistent with what we said at the Investor Day in December.","Richard F. Smith","David, just 2 other data points. One, Lee mentioned it, on the second fast growth business in the quarter, Workforce Solutions, as he mentioned, the WASI [ph], the fact that we had no revenue at that time but we still had the expenses to produce the WASI [ph] products and then PSol gets fluctuation obviously depends on the level of advertising investment. But again, look at the stuff we gave you for this year, 26% to 27%, obviously, the big business units have got to step up to get there, and we're confident they will. And two, as Lee said, that will be good as it's going to give you a framework on a multiyear, so go back and look at that. We stand committed to those numbers.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just given the divestitures and some of the restatement, I have a couple of quick housekeeping questions if I could. To what business segment within USCIS are you moving PSol revenue to?","Lee Adrean","That would be the online business.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, did Equifax Settlement Services previously rely -- reside in Mortgage Solutions?","Lee Adrean","Yes.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it did.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the Talent Management disposal, was that within Employer Services?","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just finally for 2013, do you have a read on interest expense, tax rate and D&A?","Lee Adrean","Yes. Interest expense, I'm going to do this one from memory. Tax rate will be between 35% and 37% for the year. Interest expense, between $60 million [ph] and $75 million for the year, and D&A, I don't have. I think, my recollection is it's roughly comparable, up slightly to this year. Well actually, that's not true because I'm not factoring in -- plus and then add CSC on top of it and I don't remember what that number is.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","What's the amortization schedule on the goodwill for the acquisition?","Lee Adrean","Goodwill is not amortized. The bulk of the amortizable intangibles, I believe, are over about 15 years.","Operator","Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The 26% to 27% operating margin guidance, it seems a little conservative to me. Can you maybe just help us understand sort of the moving parts there and, I guess, the confidence in that range?","Richard F. Smith","Well, if confidence is higher, we wouldn't have given you the range. We talked that range in December, reiterate now, it's factoring in the benefits of CSC, it's also factoring in the fact that we, as we mentioned, the December we'll take roughly $20 million of the upside and invest -- upside being from the CSC acquisition and reinvest that back into the business for infrastructure needs, as well as products to accelerate growth long term. So you're going to get core organic non-CSC, if you will, expanded margins in line with the long-term range we gave you a year or so ago, 20, 25 basis points. You layer on top of that the CSC benefit and take out about $20 million for reinvestment.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And I mean, in terms of the divested assets, I guess you mentioned you had that planned. What's the outlook in terms of -- are there many other units, a few other units out there that potentially fit in that non-core bucket?","Richard F. Smith","That's an ongoing process, I don't see any right now, to be honest. It's an ongoing process. As you know, over the 7.5 years I've been here, we've disposed of DMS business, we disposed of a little [indiscernible] business and now these 2, so all relatively small amounts strategic. But no, at this juncture, I see nothing else at that non-core description that needs to be disposed of, no.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. okay. And then one final one. Just on the -- I think it was on the fraud side where you guys had mentioned you guys are going to step up investment there, potentially look for acquisitions. Maybe you could just dip a little more granular into what areas of the fraud that are seeming really attractive at this point in time?","Richard F. Smith","Well, we think we're uniquely positioned with our unique data assets to be a bigger player. We're a good-sized player today. We're over $100 million in the traditional -- between $100 million and $150 million, to be exact, in the traditional fraud market. A lot of it with the Work Number does when you have the verification of employment, verification of income, is the sole fraudulent promise. We're announcing a new leader, a new focus, a new team internally to take these historic products we have in fraud, build a new strategy to invest. I think what we're going to see initially is leveraging our current assets to be a bigger, faster grower in this marketplace. We will look at acquisitions if they make sense. But again, as we discussed in December and discussed in many different conferences, we think we're really uniquely positioned to be a player here in a much bigger way.","Operator","Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just looking back at 2012, I just wondered if you could give us a split between refi and purchase within mortgage, and what was mortgage revenue for the -- or mortgage-related revenue for the entire 2012.","Richard F. Smith","Yes. The total, we've always talked about mortgage being somewhere in a range of 15% to 20%. It was in the upper end of that range, in the upper teens for the year. Refinancing makes up approximately 70% or more of that business. And as we talked about as we look at the guidance for 2013, the 15% down year-on-year for the year as we factored into our budget, it largely is driven by the assumption that rates do go up and refinancing drops in the second half of the year.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And can you split out that upper teens revenue exposure between refi and purchase?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, again, roughly 70% of the total. And one thing you should know, Paul, too, as you think about your model going forward is that the Settlement Services product that we launched and have just sold will reduce our exposure to the mortgage market if you look back by about 3%.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And, Lee, if I could just ask real quick, does the pension settlement help your cost going forward?","Lee Adrean","It had minimal impact on our expense.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Rick, you've talked about NPI for some time, you're obviously gaining some pretty nice traction. And now it sounds like as an extension of those efforts, perhaps strategically you're pivoting toward an increasingly high-value offering to your customers as evidenced in telco with the new USCIS this quarter. Can you just talk about sustainability of pricing? I think that's something incrementally that is a positive surprise at least to our mind and also talk about that in the context of how CSC will affect the USCIS pricing, reported pricing results, in '13.","Richard F. Smith","Yes. Two great questions. You know, Andrew, we have been at strategic pricing, which is -- for about 6.5, almost 7 years now. We built a -- I don't use this term loosely, a world-class pricing team. There's a lot of opportunity left still. And it's not just a matter of picking a price from X to X-plus-something. It's how you bundle products together, it's how you segment your customers properly, it's really understanding price elasticity, it is new product introduction. So it's across many different facets and I like to -- we're in early innings of the pricing game here at Equifax. Specific to CSC, and one of the values we talked about a little bit in December, is the ability to deploy the things that we think are unique to Equifax on new assets and this asset would be CSC, things like process improvement in LEAN, but also pricing. So one of the first things that Rudy and his team are doing is taking the asset base that we've purchased, and making sure the pricing team looks at all the opportunities across different customers, different verticals and segments and so on and so forth, and instilling the same level of discipline there that we have in the core of the business around the world. So I think there's opportunity for CSC.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it does sound like you're maybe a little more sanguine with regard to the sustainability of your pricing.","Richard F. Smith","Yes. If you think about our long-term objective of growing the operating margin 25 basis points, some of it comes from leverage, just gross scale, and some of it comes from process improvement and the other key driver is and will be [indiscernible]","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Lee, just to clarify, did you say 100 basis points roughly of annual EBIT margin improvement in '13?","Lee Adrean","No. I said we should be in the 26% to 27% range so...","Richard F. Smith","Up from 20, was the last year's rate.","Lee Adrean","24.7% for the year.","Richard F. Smith","It's 24.7% last year, and we're going 26% to 27%.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then Rick, if I might sneak one more in. Could you just talk about any regulatory expenses? I assume they're baked into your guidance, but is there any maybe long tail kind of surprise risk out there?","Richard F. Smith","Well, maybe I'll start with a broader answer than maybe what you think, which is CFPB. We have regulatory expenses that we manage in every geography we operate, and the regulatory landscape around the world is moving at a pace that's unlike anything I've seen in my time here. The contemplated expenses, yes, are in our budget. Specific to the CFPB, which is our new regulator in the U.S., that landscape is still moving. They were here with us for multiple weeks at the end of the year. They're going across the industry, gathering as much knowledge as they can about the industry. We don't know yet when their mandate will be published, and hence, what we've got to do as a business. But right now, what we're doing is spending time building out what we call compliance management organization, so the ability to actually be compliant once a mandate comes out. So I always tell people, Andrew, we have been heavily regulated throughout our existence. It's just the cost of doing business. We're prepared for it, and we also look at it on the revenue side, by the way, as every bit as much of an opportunity as there is going to be a threat. And what I mean by that, if you think about the ability to pay, which is a mandate coming out of CFPB, look at the policies around mortgage, we think we're very uniquely positioned to help CFPB, help the underwriters and help the consumers.","Operator","Carter Malloy of Stephens has our next question.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So first on the slight pickup there in the credit marketing piece -- or the marketing piece presumably with CMS versus IXI, is that -- do you see that as a good predictive indicator? Are you seeing card marketing budgets picking up? Is that something that we should see as a positive for growth in '13 in that piece of the business?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, we've seen card activity steadily ramp up towards the end of the year. Pre-screened business within that was up double-digit for the quarter, which is good.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Latin America business, can you give us an update on Boa Vista, how that business is trending and if and when you guys expect to maybe consolidate that?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, Carter, we were just down there last week, and on the integration side, it's going extremely well across all fronts. Being very well received, we've met with some of the largest banks in Brazil. Current customers and customers who want to do more with us. Reiterating the point to them that we in Equifax are keenly interested in being a long-term player in Brazil. So across all fronts, it's going well. The time line is undefined at this point in time, but stay tuned. It's an asset I want to control if we can get the asset the right price. So stay tuned and it's a good market by the way.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And it's growing at a decent clip and has a good margin on it?","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, to do a quick housekeeping one for Lee here is on the mortgage revenue exposure, call it 19% for 2012. I assume that's with Settlement Services, so x Settlement Services, your mortgage exposure on a run-rate basis is more like 15%, 16% something like that right now?","Lee Adrean","Yes. Around 16% to 17% -- 19% to 20% this year, 16% to 17% next year, excluding ESS.","Operator","Our next question will come from George Mihalos with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Allison Jordan","This is Allison, in for George. I had a question on mortgage volume for 2013. You had previously mentioned an expectation of a 1- to 2-point hit on revenue growth due to lower mortgage volumes. Has your outlook there changed?","Richard F. Smith","Not at this juncture. We have -- we follow that, Allison, on a regular basis, as you might guess. We've got an internal economist. We've external economist we deal with, there's external benchmarks that you see, and at this juncture it still looks as if though we should expect a reasonable market in the first half of the year and then slowing in the second half of the year for a total mortgage market now being down 15%. And again, if you've followed us in the past, we expect that our business will decrease at a lesser rate than that as we drive penetration and we drive new products. But the market expectation still remains at 15% down for the year.","Allison Jordan","Okay, great. And then just one more question about Commercial Solutions. I guess it's good to see it's growing again. What are your thoughts on the sustainability of that growth for 2013, and what do you think a reasonable long-term target is?","Richard F. Smith","I remain optimistic that they have turned the corner, I mentioned that the pipeline was up over 40% as they exited the year versus the year prior. They're executing at a higher level now, which is important. It's critical for them to improve their execution in a tough market environment. We gave a framework in December at the New York Stock Exchange for commercial, which was a multi-year growth bid to upper level. Yes, so I think it's growing this business in the mid to upper single digits is reasonable long term.","Operator","Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan has our next question.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Lee, I wanted to ask you a little bit about seasonality. When I look through the Equifax longer history, it looks like first quarter might have negative seasonality and fourth quarter might be seasonally favored. Over the last few years, we haven't seen that. And I'm just kind of assuming, it's the great recession and the mortgage pickup. So my question to you is when you look at first quarter guidance here for 2013, does this reflect kind of a return to more normal seasonality or has seasonal patterns changed since last week review trends kind of before the great recession?","Lee Adrean","Andrew, I think you're on the right issue. I think we have returned to something more like normal seasonality. Historically, the first quarter was the -- and our quarters are not that different, but the first quarter has typically been slightly weaker than the others, and I think that's what we are anticipating for this year. I would expect the second and third quarters would be the strongest quarters in 2013, and the fourth quarter could be, again, a little bit softer if mortgage market is slipping over the course of the latter half of the year. So Q1 and Q4, likely a little softer than Q2 and Q3 in terms of dollar amount of revenue and dollar amount of earnings.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And when you say dollar amount, you mean sequential, right?","Lee Adrean","Yes.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then if I could just ask one more question on margins, do you feel like margins also have that type of seasonality, Lee?","Lee Adrean","Yes. The middle quarters would probably be the strongest margin quarters for the year.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Which one, second or third?","Lee Adrean","Yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So first question, I just want to confirm, you talked about 1% to 2% drag from mortgage and the 10% to 12% guidance. I just want to confirm we were still looking at 5% or 6% from CSC and 6% to 8% organic to get to the 10% to 12%.","Lee Adrean","Yes. If you're breaking out mortgage separate from organic, that would be right.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then on PSol, what percentage of revenue in 2012 was breach-related?","Richard F. Smith","I don't think I have it on the top of my head. Do you guys have that? There were a few breaches -- maybe just back up as we think about it, Bill. Historically, we've had a down drag on breach. It was high a number of years ago. Basically there was amendments for a number of years. 2012, we did have a bit of an uptick with 2 main breaches, so the breach...","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So we're looking at like less than 10%?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, way less than that amount.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, no problem. Then I wanted to ask a favor from Lee, if you don't mind walking me through again within online CIS, the pricing volume mix equation there. We talked about the volume being down 9%, I just want to make sure I followed that.","Lee Adrean","Yes. Average revenue -- we break it into revenue per transaction and then volume, and it can be a little misleading because we have some non transaction price revenue that affects revenue per transaction the way we do this simple calculation. But what happened in the fourth quarter is we shift our transaction mix, shift it towards higher-priced segments. Mortgage has a tendency to accentuate that, as mortgage tends to be in higher-priced segments, and away from some high-volume but lower unit price accounts. And then second, we did have increased revenue from subscription-billed products that we're having success with, and that affects our simple calculation of revenue per transaction. And then, transaction volume was down 9% due to that shift in -- away from high-volume but lower price accounts.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So just the revenue per transaction was up how much?","Lee Adrean","17%.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","17%, got you. And would you throw in something there for mix or is that just built into that?","Lee Adrean","That reflects the shift in mix to higher-priced segments.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So the high-volume unit price accounts, what business line was that where you're seeing that shift?","Lee Adrean","They were -- I mean that's in OCIS online and that's in financial services customers.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean, what -- is it credit card or some other vertical?","Richard F. Smith","Bill, it's broad-based.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then the final question, I just wanted to ask you your thoughts around post the CSC acquisition. Your thoughts on your timing for going and doing M&A again, share repurchases, the general capital allocation question?","Richard F. Smith","The M&A will be dictated by strategy and what's available. We continue to be in the market looking for good tuck-in acquisitions around the world. I think initially what you're going to see is use the cash flow to pay down debt. We've talked about a range of 1.75 to 2.0-ish. We're at the upper end of that, and we'd like to get that down so it doesn't mean we won't do acquisitions but initially I think of it as paying down debt to get us back in a comfortable range. Lee, do you want to add there?","Lee Adrean","No, I think that's accurate.","Operator","And our last question will come from Dan Leben with Robert W. Baird.","Daniel R. Leben - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First, you mentioned some regulatory uncertainty by clients around IXI, could you just expand on that a little bit and talk about what the issue was and then how it's being addressed?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. There are attributes that we use when we build various models across the business, including IXI. There were a few of our customers that were concerned about the use of some -- I'm not going to go into exactly what those are, but they were concerned about using those attributes in the future and would the government frown upon those and seeing those as maybe being discriminatory or misleading attributes. So we have to do -- by the way, there was no mandate from any one regulatory body that said you can't use these attributes, which is uncertain. And that uncertainty caused our customers to take pause, and what we've been spending our time doing is one, educating ourselves, educating our customers, but most importantly, building models that did not use those attributes. And we've done so, and those models proved to be largely as predictable as the old model. So we're taking those models now back to our customers.","Daniel R. Leben - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fantastic. And then just on the Settlement Services disposition, great example of a win for NPI. Could you just talk about what changed behind that business and why you don't view it as strategic versus a couple of years ago, and then just secondarily, any commentary around the multiples you received on the 2 dispositions, would be great.","Richard F. Smith","Yes. The ESS was a great new product, as you've mentioned. I think it must have been 6 or 7 years ago when we built that product. And it was a way to add more value to our current customer base. We had and hoped to get a different balance. If you look at the product offerings within the ESS, you get appraisal, and you have title close and we had built a long-term model with a different balance of mix between those 2 offerings, title close versus appraisal, we could never quite get the level we wanted on title close as a result of margin. It was not at the level we felt long-term made sense. There's better uses of our capital than that. So we sold it. And it's sort of multiple [indiscernible] tiny business. So it's -- I'm not going to disclose the multiple itself but take it as very small.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Okay. With that, operator, we'll conclude the call. Thanks to everybody for your participation, and have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. Once again, that will conclude our call for today. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8694":["Equifax (NYSE:EFX) Q4 2014 Earnings Call February 12, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Richard F.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations, and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, adjusted operating revenue and adjusted operating margin that will be adjusted for certain items which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted operating revenue includes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings from 2013 revenue.","Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects as well as certain other items. The other items excluded for 2013 are the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013, the resource realignment charge and the impairment of our investment in Boa Vista.","In 2014, we also excluded the associated tax effects in addition to the impact of a settlement of a legal dispute over certain software license agreements.","The adjusted operating margin also excludes certain items. For 2013, adjusted operating margin excludes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings and the resource realignment charge. For 2014, the adjusted operating margin excludes the legal settlement regarding the dispute over software license agreements.","All of these measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website.","Also, refer -- please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.equifax.com for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, for that very detailed introduction, that was great, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. As I always do, I'll go through the high-level review of the fourth quarter. Jeff -- or John will then go through the financial. I'll come back with an outlook for 2015, then we'll go to Q&A.","We finished 2014 in very strong fashion and we carry some good momentum as we move into 2015. Looking back at last year, both reported growth and constant currency growth in the fourth quarter finished at their highest level of the year, which is always a good thing. For the quarter, fourth quarter 2014, total revenue was $625 million, up 8% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from the fourth quarter 2013. In the quarter, FX created a $13 million year-over-year headwind, which was a significant increase from the third quarter headwind of $6 million. I think you all are intimately aware of what's going on with the euro, the ruble, the pound and others.","Core non-mortgage market growth accelerated nicely to 8% in the quarter ending the year at 7%, solidly in the range of our long-term growth model. Consistent with the view we've articulated throughout the year, the mortgage market was no longer a headwind in the fourth quarter. As a result, in 2015 and beyond, we'll focus our attention on the constant currency organic growth rate. What I mean by that is we've broken out the past few years -- because of volatility, we've broken out mortgage impact and we'll no longer do that because we, as I'll talk about later on, we expect the mortgage market to be relatively benign year-on-year when we look at 2015.","The adjusted operating margin for the fourth quarter was 26.5%, in line with the guidance that we gave you for the quarter. Our adjusted EPS was $1.02, up 12% from $0.91 a year ago, and it was at the upper end of the range that we've guided to.","Also, given our strong performance for the quarter and the year, we've announced a 16% increase in the dividend, moving from $0.25 a share per quarter to $0.29 a share.","As I always do, we transition into some of the business units highlights that I think are noteworthy. First, let's start with USIS. They accelerated their revenue and their margin -- and expanded their operating margins throughout 2015, and they're poised to deliver an even stronger top line growth and margin expansion in 2015 than they delivered in 2014.","A couple of highlights. Decision 360, which we've talked to you a lot about, continues to deliver unique value for our customers and drive revenue growth for us.","A couple of interesting data points. In 2014, if you take our top 100 customers, on average, they use now up from 1 product to 3 different unique data assets that we have, which is really adding value to them and to us.","It's even a better story when you look at our KCP accounts. We've talked to you about that, the key client program accounts, about 8 of our largest customers in the United States. On average, they are now consuming 4.5 products, unique data assets that we have. And again, anytime we can bundle the unique data assets together to add value to a client, they win and we win. So Rudy Ploder and his team have done a great job of not just monetizing these assets, but making it easy for our customers to consume.","Sticking with USIS. We continue to make great progress in the auto sector, where we provide not only credit information to our auto customers, but also adding now employment income verification. In 2014, revenues from our auto group grew by 17%, almost 3x the rate of the market growth. We expect that trend to continue in 2015 as well.","IXI had a very successful year, returning to strong double-digit growth, driven by new product innovation and deeper penetration with some of our largest, most important customers.","One of our more significant and unique fraud initiatives, ID management and authentication, continue to position us well with large government contract opportunities, particularly with the federal agencies, such as Social Security Administration and the IRS. In 2014, we processed over 516 million identity verifications within the government and across all verticals in the U.S. alone. Through the concerted effort of USIS, enterprise selling has become an integral part of our go-to-market initiative. We developed a detailed strategy for each vertical, including pricing, product innovation, distribution, incentive compensation, enabling us to further accelerate market growth and penetration.","On to International, we had an outstanding execution of the NPI initiatives. They delivered a vitality index of 14%, fueling solid growth in virtually every market where we operate. We anticipate revenue growth to be at the upper end of the long-term range for 2015, which is 7% to 10%, and we expect margins to expand nicely throughout the course of 2015.","Some highlights there. Single-digit growth in our core Information Solutions product offerings, coupled with double-digit growth in Decision Solutions and Personal Solutions, resulted in another year of strong organic growth and a much stronger market position as we enter 2015. U.K. exited the year with double-digit growth and very high-single-digit growth rate for the year, significantly outpacing the economic environment growth. Particularly for us, it was a double-digit growth in decision analytics and Personal Solutions. That's a trend that's continued now for 3 or 4 years in the U.K.","Canada exited the year with very healthy double-digit constant currency growth rate, primarily driven by their core Information Solution product offerings. Those are 2 great examples of where the team is executing at a level enabling them to grow at significant levels above and beyond what the economy is contributing.","Latin America delivered broad-based, double-digit constant currency growth across virtually all major product lines in all countries.","In Russia, we added over 20 million records to the credit database and have significantly expanded the data assets in our fraud prevention system. We should talk a little bit about Russia, we've got some questions. Obviously, the sanctions and the ruble will impact our view of Russia going forward, at least for 2015.","Finally, all of the centers of excellences that support our business units, especially in this case, International, have dedicated significant resources to ensure the successful integration of TDX. And I believe right now, the integration of TDX is largely behind us. TDX and the COEs will now focus their immediate attention on the very large opportunity with the U.K. government that we announced in December. For that project, which is going well, there'll be required IT developments in order to meet the security requirements of the U.K. government. We're, in essence, standing up the environment to handle what the government needs. It's going as planned, as scheduled. We expect that environment to be stood up sometime in the late second quarter to mid-third quarter. Start getting the data into system at the time, it takes us some time to format the data, cleanse the data and then work with our partners, the collection agencies. We expect to monetize -- start monetizing that win some time in the late fourth quarter and ramp up really nicely in 2016. So that's going as planned.","On the Workforce Solutions. They had a blockbuster year in 2014. Despite significant headwinds from the mortgage market, Workforce Solutions delivered strong double-digit, non-mortgage market organic growth once again and 270 basis points of margin expansion for the year. We're expecting to get another really solid, good growth here in 2015 for EWS as well as meaningful margin expansion once again, that's the great thing about those models.","Our Workforce Solutions exited the fourth -- exited the year and the fourth quarter with core non-mortgage market organic growth rate of over 17%, remarkable. For the year, core non-mortgage market growth was 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in auto, government and preemployment. We now have over 4,300 companies across the United States contributing employment and income information to The Work Number database.","Our data and analytics initiatives, which we talked to you about now for a couple years, are key drivers of revenue growth in both 2014 and 2015. In fact, we are looking at 35% to 40% growth in our analytics product line across EWS in 2015. In 2014, we signed 227 contracts with companies who need to assure their compliance obligations under the Affordable Care Act.","In addition to the incremental revenues, customers are also contributing their employment and income information to The Work Number database. So it is two bites of the apple, if you will, making money on the analytics for ACA as well as building the database at a much faster rate.","We're also developing a number of other innovative analytical solutions to enlighten employers about the demographics and the profile of their workforce, truly taking EWS and bringing it to the level of any other business we have around in the world, if not even higher, in the area of analytics.","We've also broadened our relationship with CMS, leveraging our historical records to provide employment income verification on individuals and alleviate their need to use alternative, more costly sources of information. We're expecting our CMS relationship to grow by over 50% in 2015 when compared to 2014. What I meant by that comment there is we started off with CMS just using very recent records off The Work Number, we're now going back to older records, which still add great value and provide solutions to CMS, thus providing an increased revenue source for us.","Finally, our compliance center initiatives, such as I-9, are generating strong interest from employers who require great assurance on their compliance with numerous regulatory -- regulations and laws, and that's been a great growth vehicle for them and EWS.","On the PSol. They have moved aggressively on their four-pronged strategy that I outlined briefly in the third quarter call, improving on their execution of delivering value-added products that consumers need and want, expanding our presence in the indirect market through the TrustedID acquisition, enhancing our International opportunities, leveraging our domestic delivery platforms and product strategies and evaluating opportunities in the lead generation space to compete more directly with the freemium companies that exist. We anticipate 2015 growth in margin will be in the range of their long-term model we communicated to you before.","We have a variety of initiatives in value-based acquisitions and retention. We improved customer lifetime value of our core product offerings by almost 45%. We also have a number of other initiatives underway addressing our media strategy, increasing ARPU and lowering our churn, all of which enable us to deliver stronger growth and margin expansion.","In the indirect market, our TrustedID team has signed contracts or is in negotiation with financial -- large financial institutions and nonfinancial institutions on opportunities, which, in aggregate, could represent up to $25 million of annualized revenue potential. H&R Block is an excellent example of how we're developing highly customized and unique product offerings which support and enhance our indirect partners' customer relationships. It also underscores how Personal Solutions is developing new products and expanding its distribution channels with solutions that help consumers address the ever-growing threat of identity theft. Millions of taxpayers are victims of tax identity theft, where criminals use a consumer's personal information to file a fraudulent tax return. Leveraging our data and analytics expertise, combined with H&R Block's tax-related capabilities and expertise, H&R Block's Tax Identity Shield provides consumers with the ability to better understand their vulnerabilities for tax identity theft, and most importantly, take the appropriate steps to help reduce that vulnerability. This is the first and only tax theft -- tax identity theft protection and restoration system product in the marketplace today, and we're proud to be working with a great partner like H&R Block.","For the past few years, North American Personal Solutions team has worked very closely with their counterparts in the U.K. to accelerate the growth in the U.K. Effective in January of this year, we've decided to realign our Personal Solutions segments to include now the U.S., Canada and the U.K. And eventually, we expect to make this a global business, including Latin America. And the whole goal here is to leverage the infrastructure and expertise and the investments we're making in our largest PSol business, which is the U.S., to accelerate growth around the world, and it's paying dividends.","Finally, Personal Solutions has been very innovative with a vitality Index of over 17% for 2014, the highest of any business unit in the company. And it's one of the reasons why we believe there'll be a number of opportunities in the lead gen space for us to deliver incremental revenue growth and to establish a strong, competitive position in the marketplace. Our unique mix of consumer data assets and strong partnerships with many of our customers should enable us to grow superior solutions in this space.","Before I go over to John, let me just transition back with some things going on at the corporate level. At the corporate level, in addition to improving our overall operating efficiency with our LEAN organization, which you're aware of, has been around for about 8, 9 years now, at the request of some of our key client customers, our largest customers, the large A customers, we have now rolled out LEAN at their request into their operations. This effort has significantly strengthened our relationship with these customers and providing valuable insights on how to further reduce their operating expenses and improve effectiveness through the application of our various product offerings, a really unique way to add value to our customers at their request.","New Product Innovation at the corp level continues to be one of our strongest engines for growth. We launched last year what we call NPI 2.0, and what that's done for us is enhance our Voice of Customer process to better understand our customers' needs and challenges. We've developed a better market testing environment that enabled us to bring products to market faster, build prototype and to launch full speed, to establish metrics for -- reestablish metrics for local NPI and made more effective use of our different IT platforms. So it's really refreshed NPI, and the results were solid last year.","Here's an example. We're building products, as I said, faster, accelerating revenue at faster rates. And a great example is what we're doing in our Fraud and ID services, revenue of which globally was up over 17% last year. So it enables Fraud and ID to prototype a product faster, get customer feedback faster and then launch that product faster than we ever could in the past. So we should see time to revenue for NPI be reduced as a result of what we're doing with 2.0.","In short, 2014 was an outstanding year. In addition to delivering record revenue and earnings growth, the team executed well on our 4 corporate imperatives and they are: delivering consistent, strong, profitable growth and shareholder returns; number two, developing unparalleled analytical insights, leveraging our unique data assets; three, continue to innovate for market leadership in key domains and verticals that are important to us; and fourth, further strengthen our reputation as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world.","So with that, John, the financials, please?","John W. Gamble","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis.","The FX headwind accelerated in the fourth quarter beyond what we originally expected. For the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $13 million and adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by about $0.03 a share.","Now let me turn to the business unit financial performance for 4Q '14. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $284 million, up 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Online Information Solutions revenue was $198 million, up about 7% when compared to the year ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $25 million, also up 7% compared to Q4 2013. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application index, which was down 13% in the fourth quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $61 million, down 10% when compared to the year-ago quarter. IXI revenues were up double digits from 2013. The decline in CMS was primarily driven by $7.2 million of prior year revenues, which are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables and which Jeff referred to in his introduction. Excluding these prior year revenues from 2013, Financial Marketing Services would be up about 0.7% and CMS would be down about 1%.","The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 40.8%, up from the adjusted operating margin of 39% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","International's revenue was $159 million, up 15% on a reported basis and up 25% on a local currency basis. Acquisitions contributed approximately 15 points of the local currency growth. Constant currency organic revenue growth was about 10%.","By region, Europe's revenue was $72 million, up 44% in U.S. dollars and up 47% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX. Organic revenue growth in Europe was slightly above 10%.","Latin America's revenue was $49 million, down 3% in U.S. dollars but up 13% in local currency, which included the acquisitions of Inffinix and the credit bureau in Paraguay. Organic growth was 6%, driven by double-digit organic growth in Decision Solutions and Analytical Services.","Canada revenue was $39 million, with organic growth of 3% in U.S. dollars and 12% in local currency.","For the fourth quarter, International's operating margin was 22.6%, down from 29.1% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $129 million for the quarter, up 15% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. All growth in Workforce Solutions was organic. Verification Services, with revenue of $81 million, was up 24% when compared to the same quarter in 2013. Employer Services revenue was $48 million, up 2% compared to last year.","The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 32.5% compared to 28.9% in Q4 2013.","North America Personal Solutions revenue was $59 million, up 2%. Growth was driven primarily by Canadian subscription growth and indirect revenue through TrustedID.","For the fourth quarter, operating margin was 33.7% compared to 30.7% in Q4 2013, largely driven by reduced marketing expense in the quarter.","I should note that the figures I just presented reflect the organizational structure as it existed on December 31, 2014. As Rick noted, as of January, we have realigned our business units, consolidating our U.K. Personal Solutions along with North American Personal Solutions into the new Personal Solutions segment.","In the attachments to our earnings release, we are providing 8 quarters of restated history for the segments as we will be reporting them in 2015. We also present our multiyear business model in the new business unit configuration.","For the full year 2014, consolidated revenue of $2.44 billion was up 6% on a reported and an adjusted basis and up 7% on constant currency basis. The full year operating margin was 26.2% while the adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, down slightly from 26.7% in 2013.","Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax was $2.97 compared to $2.69 for 2013. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.89, up 8% when compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.60 in 2013.","Operating cash flow was again very strong at $203 million in 4Q '14 and $616 million for the year. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 1.4 million shares for $115 million in 4Q '14 and 3.9 million shares for $302 million in calendar year 2014.","Our strong cash flow in 2014 allowed us to complete $340 million of acquisitions in addition to over $300 million in share repurchases and still maintain a very conservative leverage ratio of 1.8x EBITDA.","We believe we have significant debt capacity available to us within our current credit ratings and are comfortable operating at leverage ratios in the 2.5x EBITDA area.","With our strong cash flow and substantial available leverage, we can implement the 16% dividend increase we announced yesterday and continue a substantial share repurchase program while completing acquisitions consistent with the high end of our targeted 1% to 2% of annual revenue range.","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, John. I'll quickly summarize before we go to questions. As we look at 2015, we expect the U.S. mortgage market will move from a headwind to slightly positive year-on-year. We could discuss that in detail during the Q&A. We expect, however, FX will continue to represent a headwind for both revenue and EPS throughout the year.","The guidance I will provide is organic growth only at this time. However, as the year unfolds, I would anticipate adding to our overall growth rate through some M&A.","With that and based upon the current level of domestic and international business activity and current FX rates, we expect 2015 revenues to be between $2.550 billion to $2.6 billion. This reflects constant-currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 10% in 2015, which is up from a 4% growth rate in 2014. The strong revenue growth is partially offset by what we anticipate to be 2 to 3 points of negative impact from FX. And again, this reflects organic growth at this time.","At current FX rates, we expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.20 and $4.30 per share. Excluding the $0.12 per share negative impact from FX at the current rates, this reflects 11% to 14% growth in 2015, which is beyond the upper end of our range of the long-term model we have for growth, which is 10% to 13%. This guide is consistent -- the revenue growth is consistent with the long-term business model for organic growth.","We also expect our 2015 operating margin to be up over 27%, which is up nicely from the 26.5% in 2014. Also, our priorities for capital allocation have not changed. We remain committed to our dividend policy of 25% to 35% of adjusted net income, reinvesting in our business with CapEx in the range of $75 million to $100 million and continuing our acquisition focus.","Given our strong cash flow and conservative debt leverage, absent any major acquisitions, we intend to continue our current significant level of stock buyback activity.","And finally, we anticipate the tax rate for the year to be between 35% and 36%.","For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $632 million and $642 million, reflecting constant-currency organic growth rate of 11% to 13%, and this will be partially offset by 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.00 and $1.03, which is up 12% to 16%. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects 15% to 18% organic growth. And also for the first quarter, we expect operating margin to finish over 27%, which is up over 100 basis points from 2014.","So with that, operator, if you could please open it up for any questions our audience might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first from David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Nice to see the 16% dividend increase. Rick, could you comment on how many Work Numbers are now in the database. What are your goals for Work Numbers in the database, let's say, over the next year or 2? And what's the significance of the current number of work records in terms of driving business growth?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, Dann has done a hell of a job there and his team, David, not only taking the traditional path to adding Work Number records, but being very innovative with things like the ACA platform with different partners out there, and we're seeing an acceleration at the rate at which we're adding records. The total database ended the year well over 250 million, the active database well over 60 million. We -- as I mentioned in my opening comments, over 4,300 companies now are contributing. That's growing at a rapid clip every year. I see no reason we can't get the active records up over 100 million records in the database, in total over 300 million. And as I've always said before, both add value. The historical records, as I've mentioned on the CMS talk a few minutes ago, is a great source of revenue, and elsewhere, and you obviously know the value of the active records. And the significance of getting that database -- continuing to drive it, obviously, is incremental revenue. Every time you add a record, you get a hit, you get X amount of dollars. But as you continue to go from 30 million active to 40 million to 50 million to 60 million to 70 million, the viability that database has in high-transaction volume verticals is greatly enhanced. So we're making great progress in places like credit card, automotive, insurance as some examples.","David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division","Got it. And then just shifting gears, John, could you break down the online CIS unit growth and unit pricing trends in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis?","John W. Gamble","Sure. So I think core credit decisioning volume was up 14% and revenue per transaction was down about 5%. And the down about 5% was really volume mix.","David Togut - Evercore ISI, Research Division","And what are your thoughts for 2015 in terms of volume growth and revenue per transaction in online CIS?","Richard F. Smith","I don't expect a significant mix change in 2015 versus 2014, David. What you're seeing on volume is great growth in places like KCP. Again, I mentioned before, those are our 8 most strategic, larger, more complex customers that we deal with, bank and nonbank. That was great growth last year. I expect that to continue in 2015. Automotive, I think I mentioned up 17%, 3x the market growth, that will continue. There's another dynamic, David, going on, which may be of be interest to everyone here, and that is kind of a shift, which is influencing the online activity. A shift for what we call prospect data feeds, which used to reside or does reside in our business called CMS. And what customers used to do is take this mass mailing to try to target people. What we're seeing our customers want to do now more is up-sell, cross-sell current customers at the point of sale. So what you're seeing is kind of a decline in the CMS prospect data feeds and an increase in prescreened, which is an online activity. That occurred last year. I expect that trend to continue to occur in 2015.","Operator","We'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Greg calling up for Manav. Just wanted to ask about the seasonality of the revenue growth. You're showing the 11% to 14% -- or 10% to 14% revenue growth in the first quarter and 7% to 10% for the year. Is that differential coming from mortgage? Or how should we think of that throughout the year?","Richard F. Smith","Greg, as you might know, the first quarter tends to be the slowest quarter for us and it tends to ramp throughout the year. It's a little stronger in the fourth quarter versus the other three. What you're seeing in the first quarter is a couple of factors. You mentioned one, yes, you follow the 10-year treasuries, you follow the interest rates and the mortgage applications are up in the first quarter. Our expectation, Greg, as I said in my opening comments, is we expect overall mortgage for the year to be a modest tailwind versus last year. You could see a little strength in the first quarter and then kind of dissipating as we go to second, third and fourth quarters. So mortgage is a little bit of a help in the first quarter. But beyond that, the number of wins we had last year across-the-board, that could be ACA or EWS and that could be automotive in USIS, a large direct-to-consumer win we talked about back in the third quarter is monetizing itself in the first quarter. So think about it as being overall great execution by the BU leaders, which is driving the first quarter growth rate at a higher level than we'd normally see, combined with some help from the mortgage market.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, on Personal Solutions, you've got your large competitors shifting their strategy in the direct market with the new FICO product. Just wondering how you guys are thinking about the direct market and how you're positioning yourselves there?","Richard F. Smith","I believe in the team. I believe in Trey. I think they've got a good strategy. It's a four-pronged strategy, which I laid out in the third quarter, which is, number one, to manage the core. Freemium's here to stay, no matter what. It's here to stay. So number one, he's got to manage his core business to the best of his ability, which is managing ARPU, managing churn, which they're doing. They've got great metrics. We've invested heavily in a new platform, we're calling it Renaissance [ph] within PSol, which enables them to launch products at a faster rate, better user interface and experience for the customer. Number two, he's got to leverage the headcount of his indirect model. We bought a company called TrustedID who's doing that. I mentioned $25 million worth of annual contracts that are in the pipeline, either closed or being negotiated right now. Number three, he's got to leverage everything he's doing, which is great in the U.S., to accelerate growth in Canada and the U.K. and take it to Latin America. Number four, he's in the process of developing his own free model. If you believe free is here to stay, which I do, why abdicate that responsibility to others? We're going to find a way to participate ourselves. So if he does that -- think about this as you think about building your models. Think about 2015 kind of being a transition year where performance improves throughout the year and 2016 and beyond is when we move back in that long-term growth model I communicated, which is mid- to upper-single-digit growth rates with mid- to upper-20% margins.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Davis with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My first question is on the PSol segment. Outside of the reorganization, including U.K., what should we be thinking about as a sustainable rate of growth for the legacy business? And how much of it is direct to consumer versus the affinity today?","Richard F. Smith","You've got a couple of questions there, Ryan. I gave -- just gave the overall growth, so I think it was a portfolio with 4 different levers that we have in PSol, and that's going to be the mid- to upper-single digit. I think what you're going to see over time is a low-single-digit growth for the core legacy business and faster growth in the indirect business and faster growth in the International segments and the freemium model over time. So right now, the indirect channel is a smaller piece of the total, but one of the fastest-growing pieces of the total. And that was -- that -- our capabilities are greatly enhanced. We bought TrustedID, whenever it was, 12, 18 months ago.","Ryan Davis - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. And thinking about the margin progression in the International business throughout the year, I know you said you expected the margin to expand. Do you have any expectation or a target of where you expect to exit the year at?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. We expect to be over 25%, between 25% and 26% as we exit the year.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I guess a couple of things. Starting with Workforce, great year. Rick, could you maybe elaborate a little bit on David's question about drivers. Is it primarily adding records? Or is it adding functionality and analytics, too? I'm just trying to understand sort of what the dynamics are there, so monetization and NPI and how that's influencing Workforce, in particular. And then given the momentum in that business, would you expect -- and I apologize if I missed this, would you expect '15 to show faster organic revenue growth than the long-term trend in that segment?","Richard F. Smith","Great questions. Think about the strategy -- the growth strategy in EWS on 4 dimensions, and they're all equally important. Number one is increasing the size of the database at the fastest rate we possibly can, so going from 67 million to 70 million this year, 70 million to 100 million records. That is an enormous -- you know the math, Andrew. That's an enormous growth lever in and of itself. Number two is taking The Work Number assets to either new verticals or deeper into existing verticals. We are at the early stages, for example, in automotive. It is booming for EWS, but it's very early stages. So we need to penetrate that market deeper, faster, so on and so forth, same with credit card. So more verticals and deeper in the current verticals we participate in. Number 3, it is taking analytics to a new level. I think I talked -- I can't remember the exact numbers now, Andrew, but I talked about 40% to 50% growth in analytics. It's remarkable what we've done. And it's meaningful, I'm not going to disclose the numbers, but it's meaningful dollars to the corporation, let alone to EWS, what they have done the last couple of years in analytics. And again, that's early days as well. The fourth one, which we don't talk about a lot, but is very, very important, this is kind of my fault from years ago. When we look at the employer size -- you've got The Work Number, which is the verification side, as you know, and all the other great suite of products we have, unemployment claims, tax credit, compliance center, so on and so forth. Our mentality for years, we've owned this asset for 8 years now, it's hard to believe, but to be totally honest with you today, asset is only there to protect the core Work Number. That's kind of a tough way to wake up every morning, thinking I'm here to protect. So Dann and I, a couple of years ago, decided to change the mentality. They were bringing a great new leader in Scott Collins and really changed the culture, the capabilities and the mindset to growth. So they've gone from a just project, which means you have probably negative growth to flat, to now a business that will grow for us even though things like unemployment claims are at historical lows. So that's how I think about EWS, on those 4 levers. And as far as the organic growth in 2015, yes, I think I may have mentioned, I expect their growth rate in 2015 to once again be a stellar and it will be all-organic, stellar growth and meaningful margin expansions once again.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. Yes, those long-term targets are helpful, and pretty impressive upside in that segment from even what you just reported. I guess the other question in USIS. Could you kind of just rank order the revenue growth drivers in that business in terms of new product adoption at KCP versus, again, monetization versus anything else that is critical in that sort of high-single-digit organic revenue growth expectation?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, let me tackle it from 2 angles, one is kind of strategic capabilities, another one will be verticals. On strategic capabilities, clearly, 2 significant growth drivers that we have experienced and will experience going forward. One is the -- what we call Decision 360, Andrew, which you're aware of. Now we have all these unique data assets. What Rudy has done is built this thing called the office or the connector. We've invested in systems. We have invested in prototyping capabilities that enable us now to take these unique data assets, pull them together and make it so much easier and faster for our customers to consume. That is really disrupting the marketplace. I think I mentioned that our top 100 clients are now consuming 3 products on average, our top KCP accounts are 4.5 to 5 products. So Decision 360, leveraging all these unique assets, is one huge strategic enabler. Number two is about 18 months, 2 years ago, we changed the organizational structure to a concept we call enterprise-wide, which is Rudy owns the relationship with all these large clients. So he takes all these unique assets and brings all those assets to the customers. That simplification of go-to-market strategy has helped. As far as verticals, that, I think, offers significant opportunity for core organic growth. Obviously, KCP, I mentioned significant growth last year. They will continue this year. Tom Madison's team have done a great job. Telco, we're uniquely positioned there. We have very unique data assets. Auto, we're growing at multiples of the market itself. In the midterm, I'd say -- what we're saying is a rebound in the home equity market. I think we talked about that last year. That will benefit Dann as well as Rudy. And I think that's a multiyear growth lever for us not just for 2015.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one housekeeping one, if I may sneak it in. John, I noticed corp ex was up. I know there's some seasonality in there. It was above what we were looking for. Is there any callout in that?","John W. Gamble","No. Corporate expenses, we'd indicated that we thought they're going be flat to slightly up. They were up a little more than we expected. It was really incentive compensation. We did a little better than we had thought and the incentive comp was a little higher.","Operator","We'll go next to Ato Garrett with Deutsche Bank.","Ato Garrett - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just have one question on the resulting impact from the improving -- expectation for improving mortgage trends in the first quarter. Might that actually have a positive effect on price within USIS?","Richard F. Smith","It's interesting. It'll have a positive influence on margin, and I don't think that's from a pricing perspective. If you think about the margin -- and there's different buckets or categories of mortgage. As you know, prime [ph] mortgage may be a little less profitable than the online. But in general terms, an improving mortgage market does help the margins in USIS and helps the margins in EWS.","Operator","We'll go next to Nick Nikitas with Robert W. Baird.","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just really a strong performance out of Canada in the quarter. Realize it's a smaller subsegment, but with growth accelerating to 12% constant currency year-over-year, can you just -- I mean you mentioned the broader Information Solutions strength that you're seeing, but can you talk more about the drivers behind that and your outlook for the business into 2015?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, Nick, if I could take your question and maybe just expand it a bit because there are a couple of geographies I'm particularly proud of outside the U.S. and the growth, and you mentioned one, which is Canada, but the other is U.K. I mean, as a troubled economy, it's growing double digit as you exit the year. Another's Spain. I mean, let's go look at Spain. If you look at Spain, we're growing almost double digit there as we exit the year. It's just remarkable. Those 3 countries, which are not booming economies, by any means. Canada is a commodity-based economy, they're starting to slow. So the core you are seeing there -- or the reasons you're seeing the growth in Canada, to answer your question, as well as U.K. and Spain, is the same set of strategic initiatives we have across the company, it's innovation, it's building new products, it's taking products to market faster. It's driving analytics. It's leveraging Fraud and ID. So the core strategies important to Rudy Ploder and important to Dann Adams in EWS and Trey Loughran in PSol are the same initiatives that Paulino and his team in Canada, U.K. and Spain are driving.","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just circling back to the Verification Services revenue. Can you guys talk about any benefit you saw from the ACA in Q4? And is that driving some of the expected strong growth in Q1?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. So remember, ACA, you think about under 3 buckets. There is the contractual -- the contract we have at CMS. We think we've talked about it before that we'd expected last year to end the year slightly above the minimum guarantee, that's kind of what occurred, and that will accelerate, by the way, as I mentioned in my comments, in 2015. The second bucket of revenue that was definitely additive to growth was the analytics side of ACA, which we talked about, 227 accounts. Probably going to grow something like 40%, 50% this year. And the third bucket was ACA revenue growth, which I did mention in my comments, too, Nick is, every time you sell an ACA on the platform -- not every time, most times, to a company, they've got to give us their Work Number records, and many times those are Work Number records we never had before. So once we get them into the database, it's a reoccurring monetization. So all 3 of those had some assistance in fourth quarter 2014 and will accelerate in 2015.","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, good to hear. And then just last one for me. Looking at the USIS margins, you mentioned the mortgage beneficial impact in '15. Just looking year-over-year, would you, I mean after salary growth in '14, should we expect that margin expansion to moderate going into '15?","Richard F. Smith","Well, for us, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect the company to move to a margin level of over 27% in 2015. For us to attain that, every business has got to move in the right direction, including USIS. So I expect USIS margins to continue to expand. That's just the beauty of their model, of International's model, of EWS' model, the variable cost -- the fixed cost is so high. Yes, I'd expect the margins to increase.","Operator","We'll go next to Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Two questions from me. One, I just want to make sure I'm getting the 1Q versus full year guide. There was a question I think that someone opened with. And I think you answered mortgage a little bit better relative to the year-over-year comp early in the year and tapering a little bit. But aside from that, it sounds like the 1Q strength is just reflecting wins from last year. Is there something about those wins that they would taper? Or are we just sort of waiting until we see how the year plays out and maybe things get a little bit -- maybe we have more visibility as we go out?","Richard F. Smith","It's more of the latter. It's -- I'm glad you asked the question, Brett. As we look at 2015, John and I and the BU leaders are very optimistic for the year. But to take those kind of growth rates and extrapolate those for the balance of the year, I think, is imprudent at this time. There's a lot of uncertainty where the 10-year treasuries go, what happens in Ukraine, what happens in Russia, what happens in the European economy, what happens in Greece. So not knowing or not having the clarity of what's going to happen on the macro perspective for the second, third and fourth quarter, I think it'd be imprudent to be too optimistic in the forecast we've given you now. The other thing, too, is, as I've mentioned, the forecast is largely all organic. And our philosophy is when you have a big deal like the one we won at TDX, one, getting the company integrated; and two, throwing all of the resources [ph] to get those multiyear couple of hundred million dollar opportunity up and running is the full focus of International team and of our M&A team, which is intimately involved in that. So we're kind of taking our gas -- or foot off the gas on the M&A. We'd expect that to pick up, and as I said before, in the second half of the year.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one final question, a little bigger picture. We thought USIS would show a little more strength, just our sense is that credit card offers are starting to sort of go out down into the prime and near prime from just the super prime. Credit's generally easing a little bit for consumers. We thought that would show up. It wasn't quite as strong as we thought. Is there a drag in there from North American Commercial? Or is there something kind of hidden in USIS that may be dragging a little bit that we can't see from the subsegments?","Richard F. Smith","No, to address one thing, which I'm glad you brought it up. Even though we don't disclose it anymore, our Commercial business ended the year with their highest growth rate of the year in the fourth quarter. So when you look at drag, which specific line are you looking at? CMS? Online? What are you looking at when you referenced...","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","We were just looking -- I think you guys came in at 3% all in for USIS, and I just thought generally those items, even sort of accommodating mortgage, I thought that -- we're just sort of sensing there's more, like I said, specifically on the credit card side, we just thought there'd be more pulls on your credit files than we did. So I just didn't know if you guys are seeing that or maybe not yet?","Richard F. Smith","The only one thing that I think, John talked about it a little bit, is the fact that you have a big chunk of the business, CMS, that was flat and that impacts USIS in bulk [ph].","Operator","We'll go next with Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Look, you guys kind of alluded to this a little bit, but I wanted to just probe a little further. Between the capacity on the debt side and the healthy free cash flow and the low leverage, it's just kind of a setup for the potential for a big deal, potentially deploying somewhere around $1 billion, if you want to, without stretching the business really too far. Is there -- are there deals of that size in the pipeline potentially some time for this year? Or is that really not within the kind of the scope of what you're looking at right now?","Richard F. Smith","Obviously, I'll stay at a high level, Shlomo, but you hit it on the head. We have the potential capacity to do a lot of midsized deals or some significant deals. I don't see this happening in 2015. You know my philosophy. You can only do so many large deals at a time. You want to make sure that they're operating at a level that our shareholders expect. Since I've been here in 10 years, we've done TALX, CMS, now TDX. So right now, all of our energy is really getting TDX up and running as a core business and getting us through the acquisition -- or this new win we announced up and running. So you'll see us doing deals this year, but you'll see us doing more mid- to small-sized deals. I just don't see that large, transformational deal front and center for this year. Plus, I don't really see the need to have to do a large deal this year.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And there was -- I think it was the last quarter when we talked a little bit about the implementation times for TDX and making sure that you want to kind of get that right. The timing, the sales, the demand seemed to be good, but you want to make sure that the implementation works and that might be -- maybe went a little bit slower. In the additional 3 months since the last time we talked, has there been any kind of streamlining of that or improving kind of the implementation targets for TDX deals?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, the answer is absolutely yes. And I alluded to it at very high level in my comments. We overwhelmed, in a positive way, I'd say, TDX on the integration front the second half of last year and really accelerated through the fourth quarter last year. We have supportive [ph] forecasting models down. We understand different variables. I'm very pleased with where Paulino and Andy Bodea from the operations perspective are. We've moved people over to Nottingham to assist and we are expecting double-digit growth from TDX in 2015, excluding any lift from that large deal we won in December.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just moving a little bit to the freemium space. Can you talk a little bit about the kind of strategy over there and the work that you have to do just to make sure that you don't cannibalize the existing very kind of healthy margin business [indiscernible]","Richard F. Smith","Yes, there are 2 strategies. If you just take and bifurcate the freemium into the 2 buckets, one is the organic path, which means different level of advertising, different type of advertising. And the other is the build with some sort of capability through M&A. We're looking at both. But Shlomo, I talked to the team about that and I think they get it as well. You talked about cannibalization. If we don't do something, those that exist in the marketplace will, in fact, cannibalize that for us. I would rather have our own product, which would be a high-margin product, cannibalize our core legacy business than give it to someone else. So it's a matter of fact. Over some period of time, the freemium model, I think, is going to be the dominant model. And it's either we find a way to participate ourselves or you get out altogether, I'm not going to do that. So there'll be some cannibalization, but it'd be [indiscernible].","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Okay. I thank everybody for their time and their interest in Equifax. And I think, with that, we'll terminate the call. Thanks, again.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8697":["Equifax, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our core business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin. It will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. For the third quarter of 2015, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excluded acquisition-related amortization expense, income from the settlement of certain escrow amounts and an accrual for certain legal claims. Adjusted operating margin excludes the accrual for certain legal claims. In fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax will also exclude due diligence, transaction and integration cost related to the proposed acquisition of Veda Group.","These non-GAAP measures are detailed in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website. Also please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As always, thank you for joining us this morning. Our strong first half momentum continued throughout the third quarter with very solid broad-based growth across most of our key market segments and countries. The momentum, combined with solid execution from the team and one of the deepest NPI pipelines we've had in all the past 10 years, positions us well as we move into the fourth quarter and in 2016. And in my comments later on this morning, I'll give you further look at both the fourth quarter as we always do and 2016 as well.","The Equifax's strategy is clearly resonating well with our customers. Our core disciplines and new product innovation, LEAN, IT simplification, regulatory compliance and talent assessment are enabling stronger, more consistent execution across all of our initiatives.","For the quarter, total revenue was $667 million, up 9% on reported basis and up 12% on local currency basis from the third quarter of 2014. And it was at the high end of our guidance. In the quarter, FX created a $22 million year-over-year headwind, up from the second quarter headwind, which was $19 million. Adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up nicely from 26.4% in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 13% from $1.01 last year and above the upper end of our guidance range that we provided back a few months ago.","As always, before John gives you the financial details, I'd like to briefly cover some of the key highlights for the third quarter. USIS has continued to power forward with 12% revenue growth and had a robust pipeline and opportunities to provide continued unique insights incorporating our multiple data assets. USIS delivered very solid broad-based growth in fraud and identity management solutions and commercial information. Both those business units were up double-digit versus 2014. Mortgage, direct-to-consumer and automotive were also very strong growth drivers for the quarter. And like the rest of the company, USIS is also benefiting from broad-based growth from NPI and our enterprise growth initiatives.","Little more on NPI, there are four strategic levers to USIS efforts around new product innovation. They are: one, accelerating growth by linking most relevant data with expanded analytic capabilities; two, investing in vertical expertise to drive unparalleled insights; three, focusing on customer experience through optimized enterprise distribution; and four, diversifying portfolio growth across the value chain. An interesting point is that almost 60% of the anticipated three-year NPI revenue is focused on opportunities beyond the more traditional credit risk solutions that you know us for.","Finally, this week, we announced a very exciting opportunity with Fannie Mae. You may have read that. Fannie Mae will begin incorporating Equifax trended data in addition to our verified employment and income from The Work Number database. The trended data provides new insights to lenders by expanding the credit information to aid their assessment of risk using updated analytical tools. Integrating The Work Number into Fannie Mae's underwriting system will make the process simpler for consumers and reduce the potential for fraud. We believe this will be a win-win for the consumers as well as the mortgage industry.","There's some work to be done on our side and, as a result, the revenue opportunity is expected to start sometime in the second or third quarter of next year. It will be a nice impact for both USIS and EWS. USIS is having an outstanding year in 2015. For the full year, we expect them to deliver double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%.","On to International, they delivered 14% local currency revenue growth, leveraging the diversity in its core customer verticals, new product innovation and unique platforms in decisioning, fraud, and debt management. As you know, we are now in the midst of starting up the UK government project that we've talked to you about now for a few quarters. We have provided Equifax consumer data to one government agency and have now received approximately \u00a3265 million of past-due receivables that we're now loading and analyzing and will soon move on to the collection agencies.","As we have mentioned before, we expect nominal revenue growth in the fourth quarter of this year, but we expect that to ramp up nicely in 2016. In summary, as it relates to that project, it is on track, on pace, and meeting our expectations.","In addition, we are currently exceeding our expectations with the TDX business in places like Australia and we're launching that platform across many other countries throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. In fact, it's already making a point here, as you think about the TDX platform, the debt management platform, in 2016, it will then be dispersed through multiple countries as opposed to one central P&L that you are used to seeing or can see and we can talk about in the UK.","Also in International, new product innovation continues to be a very important contributor to International's long-term growth. Their focus is in areas of analytical insights, enhanced decision solutions, new verticals and distribution channels and broadening their data assets. Revenue in International's three largest verticals: financial institutions, telcos, and SMEs, grew 17% in the third quarter versus a healthy 13% in the second quarter of 2015.","The decisioning platforms, our analytical services and our debt management revenue grew 19% in the quarter, accelerating from 17% in the second quarter of the year. In 2015, International successfully executed on its strategic initiatives and captured some very important business opportunities that will transform and further broaden its growth profile in the coming years. For the full year, we expect International revenue growth to be above their long-term range that we've talked about of 7% to 10% growth.","Workforce Solutions, which has had a stellar performance, I think you'll agree, for the year grew 13% revenue from its continued traction in its compliance solution products, driving market penetration for verification of employment and income, and some very sophisticated analytical insights.","Employer interest in our workforce analytics solutions for the Affordable Care Act remains extremely strong. Our subscription-based ACA platform solution, which enables companies to better understand their level of compliance with the requirements of ACA, is one of our most successful NPI initiatives in my 10 years here. We're now expecting to have over 700 clients by the end of this year and we're still getting a large number of inbound requests, which bodes well for EWS and the Employer Services business within EWS for 2016 and beyond.","In addition to our core product offering focus on compliance, we're also exploring other opportunities that will enable us to address evolving market needs, including fines and penalties under the Act and any related appeals that follow. We believe this will further enhance our position in the marketplace and make us an even more valuable partner to our big customers.","New product innovation continues to make a very meaningful contribution to revenue growth for EWS. We now expect to end the year with a Vitality Index of over 11% versus our target of 10% at the beginning of the year. Earlier this week, EWS was honored for the second year in a row with a Product of the Year Award by the editors of Human Resource magazine. Our I-9 Anywhere product is a cutting-edge service that enables organizations to streamline their Form I-9 immigration form completion process using remote entry for applicants. We're also exceeding our year-to-date targets for both active and historical records in The Work Number database and expect to end the year over our full-year targets.","Verification Services growth was in excess of 20% and continues to be driven by adding records to The Work Number database and strong growth in key market verticals, including auto, mortgage, consumer finance, government, and pre-employment. Workforce Solutions has had an outstanding year in 2015 by almost any measure, driving very healthy double-digit revenue growth across multiple product offerings. And for the full year, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper-teens and operating margins to settle in the upper 30%s.","Against the backdrop of a changing operating environment, PSOL is consistently delivering growth in the upper end of the multi-year target range of 4% to 6%. We continue to make good progress in key metrics for our direct-to-consumer product offerings. In indirect, we have a broad and diverse set of opportunities in the pipeline, much of which is outside of the banking sector. We expect indirect to make meaningful contributions to revenue growth again in 2016. And we continue to generate good growth in our International segments, as you know, that includes Canada and the UK.","Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. was largely driven by higher average revenue per subscriber in the quarter. For the full year, we expect Personal Solutions organic revenue growth to be within their long-term range of 4% to 6%, with healthy operating margins in the upper 20%s.","Let me transition back just for a second for a few highlights that we've talked about to you in the past at the corporate level rather than the BU level, and those are NPI and EGI. They continue to make very important contributions to our long-term growth model, provide strong discipline around the allocation of both financial and human capital resources, enabling us to execute with precision.","Year-to-date, our new product pipeline is expected to deliver three-year revenue that is 50% greater than the 2014 pipeline. As I mentioned earlier in my comments, that's probably the strongest I've seen since I've been here in 10 years and that bodes well obviously for 2016 and beyond.","All of our enterprise growth initiatives leverage our operating and project management disciplines. These disciplines ensure that we develop effective plans for execution and then deliver on the goals we set for ourselves. Our current view for our 2015 portfolio of EGI project suggests that we'll exceed our full-year target by almost 20%. And much like NPI, EGI is becoming a big part of our DNA in every geography and vertical in which we operate.","Our insights-driven strategy is a global strategy and it's heavily dependent upon having contemporary IT platforms that can be implemented globally. In the past, you've heard us talk about InterConnect platform. It was first developed in the U.S. and is now used in Canada, the UK and Latin America. We're now in the process of taking a fraud platform exchange that was originally deployed in the UK and successfully deployed in Canada a few years ago and expanding now into U.S. and across Latin America. This solution provides advanced analytics and workflow as well as a known fraud exchange focused primarily on account opening process.","The skills and project management expertise in our Global Operations COE is widely regarded and respected internally and by our customers. This organization was heavily involved in standing up the UK government opportunity for TDX, ensuring that we successfully met all of our contractual obligations while positioning us to deliver performance above the portfolio of thresholds for collection effectiveness. More recently, we have conducted a number of customer journeys where we worked directly with customers on the end-to-end process with the objective of improving both the cost effectiveness of our interactions and, as importantly, their overall experience with us.","I'm sure you're all interested in an update on our offer to acquire the Veda Group in Australia. I'll share a few thoughts with you there. We believe this opportunity is a nice strategic fit for Equifax. It expands our geographic footprint in a core segment that we know very well. Veda has a strong market position, great products and data assets. They're very profitable and would give us a strong management team in Asia.","We believe Equifax's strength in advanced analytics, enterprise growth initiatives, new product innovation and others can act to make Veda even stronger. We're currently early in the process with Veda and, at this point, our agreements with Veda include a purchase price of AUD 2.825. They're non-binding. As you can appreciate, the transaction of this size will take considerable time to negotiate and finalize. We plan to conduct our usual thorough and disciplined due diligence. Simultaneously, we will negotiate the terms and conditions of a purchase agreement. Subject to successful completion of these steps, we would anticipate signing a binding agreement later this year.","The final transaction is subject to the approval of the respective Boards of Directors, regulatory approval in Australia, as well as Veda shareholders' approval. If the transaction ultimately goes forward, we'd anticipate completion sometime between late February and early April of 2016. At this point, I'm very confident in our ability to effectively integrate Veda, should we have the opportunity to do so.","2015 is turning out to be the strongest performance in my time with the company. As many of you know, we started the journey of transforming Equifax into a global leader in information solutions back in 2005. I believe we can say we have successfully transformed the culture, thoughtfully invested our capital to support that vision, strengthened our talent base, while continuously honoring our commitments to our shareholders, customers, employees and consumers. I remain optimistic about the opportunities we have for growth in 2016 and beyond.","And with that, let me turn it over to John. John?","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Rick. And good morning everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter, we recorded income of $12 million from the settlement of certain escrow amounts related to an acquisition outside of the measurement period. We also recorded an expense of $8 million related to the settlement of certain specific legal claims. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period-to-period operating comparison. The after-tax effect of these two unusual items was positive $0.05 a share.","Now, let me turn to the business units' financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $312 million, up 12% when compared to the third quarter of 2014, another very strong quarter for USIS. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 13% when compared to the year ago period.","Mortgage Solutions revenue was $32 million, up 12% compared to Q3 2014. Total mortgage related revenue in USIS was up 20% in the quarter and mortgage related revenue for the total company was up 24%. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 17% in the second quarter. We currently expect total mortgage originations in the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year. For 2016, our current outlook is for mortgage originations to be about flat when compared to the full year of 2015.","On to Financial Marketing Services, where revenue was $47 million, up 6% when compared to the year ago quarter. The adjusted operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.9%, up from 40.3% in the third quarter of 2014.","International's revenue was $149 million, flat on a reported basis but up 14% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $64 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars but up 16% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $52 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 20% in local currency. Canada revenue was $33 million, down 13% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency.","For the third quarter, International's operating margin was about 20%, which is flat when compared to the second quarter of 2015. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect International operating margins to remain at about 20% throughout 2015. We expect margins to increase throughout 2016, reflecting continued strong local currency revenue growth including TDX as the UK government contract begins to contribute as well as the benefits of regionalization and other cost actions.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $139 million for the quarter, up 13% when compared to the third quarter of 2014. Growth for Workforce Solutions at 13% was very strong and continued to be above our long-term model of 7% to 10%. This reflects continued very strong growth in Verification Services, up 22% year-to-year.","The solid growth also reflects the following. Employer Services revenue, principally from unemployment claims, compensation claims, Work Opportunity Tax Credit and other related employer services, declined slightly year-to-year. This reflects the continued very low levels of U.S. unemployment as well as the timing of federal WOTC authorizations in 1Q 2015.","Our workforce analytics solution for ACA compliance, which is part of our Employer Services business, continues to perform well ahead of our expectations, as Rick mentioned earlier, and now has 700-plus clients in various stages of boarding, preparing for 2016 ACA reporting. However, as this is a subscription based service in which the boarding services are offered as part of the service, all of the revenue associated with boarding and subscription service fees prior to customer production go live is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the agreement.","As such, despite tremendous growth in customers and activity in the second half of 2015, revenue realization will not begin until very late in 2015, and principally 2016. Long-term, we believe the subscription based model will be greatly beneficial both in terms of customer retention and revenue predictability. It's also additive to our expectations that Workforce Solutions will continue to grow faster than our long-term 7% to 10% model. In the remainder of 2015, it will put pressure on Employer Services growth rates.","In 3Q, overall Employer Services activity was more heavily skewed to ACA compliance and that revenue was deferred and, as we indicated, deferred until very late 2015 and predominantly 2016.","The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 35.9%, up almost 350 basis points from 3Q 2014. Workforce Solutions continues to make great progress towards achieving margins consistently near 40%.","Personal Solutions revenue was $67 million, up 5% on a reported basis and up 6% on a local currency basis. For the third quarter, operating margin was 26.9% consistent with our long-term expectation for operating margins to be in the upper 20%s. The year-over-year decline in operating margin is primarily driven by marketing spend at levels more consistent with our long-term expectations.","In the third quarter, general corporate expense at $47 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be up slightly from the $47 million in 3Q 2015. The adjusted operating margin at 27.2% was up from 26.4% in 2014 and in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30.8%. This was benefited by 1.8 percentage points by the very low tax rate on the income from the settlement of the escrow we discussed earlier. Both the income from the settlement of the escrow and the related tax expense was excluded from our adjusted EPS. Excluding this 1.8 percentage point benefit, our 3Q effective tax rate was slightly higher than our effective tax rate of 32.5% in 3Q 2014, and approximately consistent with the guidance we gave for the third quarter. It was also consistent with the historical pattern of our third quarter effective tax rate being below the effective tax rate for the year. Our current expectation for the effective tax rate for the full year is to be slightly less than 34%.","Operating cash flow was very strong in the quarter at $247 million. With pending M&A activity, we reduced our level of stock repurchases in the quarter. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million and year-to-date were $94 million. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be approximately $120 million to $125 million. This is above the approximately $100 million we discussed at the beginning of 2015.","To support our continued acceleration and enterprise growth and new product innovation initiatives, we've accelerated our investments in global analytics, decisioning, fraud and exchange platforms and supporting network and data center infrastructure as well as internal systems. We are confident these investments will support both revenue growth and margin enhancement. At this level of investment, our capital spending continues to be at a modest 5% of revenue.","Earlier, Rick gave you an update on our proposal to acquire the Veda Group. This would be Equifax's largest acquisition in its history. And given the size of the acquisition and the upfront costs associated with the transaction and its integration, we will be excluding all acquisition-specific transaction and due diligence expense as well as integration expenses incurred in the first 12 months following the closure of the acquisition from our adjusted EPS.","Now, let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $665 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, that's partially offset by 2% of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in July that the fourth quarter organic growth would be at the high-end of our long-term range which we've talked about being 6% to 8% growth.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.12, which is up 8% to 10% for the quarter. Excluding $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the quarter.","Our year-to-date performance results \u2013 our strong year-to-date performance resulted in an increase of our full-year guidance, combined with our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2015 represents an outstanding year for our shareholders, our customers, employees and consumers. And for the full-year, we expect 2015 revenue to be somewhere between $2.652 billion and $2.662 billion, consistent with our guidance in July and up nicely from our guidance of $2.55 billion and $2.6 billion at the beginning of the year and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of a healthy 12% for 2015. This strong revenue growth is partially offset by 3% negative impact from FX.","As before \u2013 and this is only organic revenue growth and we're talking more about next year, we're getting back into the M&A game. As we expect, the operating margins to be somewhere in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the full year, which is up nice 80 basis points over 2014.","2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.48 per share, up from the $4.38 to $4.42 per share we guided in July and up significantly from the $4.20 to $4.30 per share guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. That growth reflects \u2013 that reflects a 15% growth in EPS for the year. On a constant currency basis, excluding $0.11 per share of negative impact from FX, at current rates, this reflects a very strong 17% to 18% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2014.","Now, it's early, but I thought I'd give you some color on how we're thinking about 2016. And as we always do, we'll come back and give you lot more clarity and depth on the February earnings call. As we share today a look at 2016, we fully expect to be towards the upper end of our organic growth target range which is 6% to 8% with additional growth coming from successful completion of our current M&A activities.","Our model that we've communicated to you or committed to you is to add over time one point, two points of growth coming from inorganic growth. If you exclude Veda, because of the size of that, our pipeline is strong. We clearly see contributing to our organic growth rate of 6% to 8%, and incremental one point or two points coming from M&A, Veda will be incremental that one point or two points.","We also expect operating margins in 2016, when you exclude the impact of acquisitions, to expand nicely given the higher growth expectations we have and this is against the backdrop of an outstanding organic growth rate in 2015. So what \u2013 and we're also expecting the challenge that the mortgage market to be relatively flat in 2016. So in summary, I think you'll agree 2015 is shaping up to be yet another outstanding year for the team. And 2016, where we sit today, we're expecting another outstanding year in 2016.","So, operator, with that, we'd like to open up to any questions our audience may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to David Togut from Evercore ISI.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Thank you. Good morning, Rick, John and Jeff.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, David.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Rick, if I've heard you correctly, you've made a pretty compelling case for higher growth than you've laid out in your mid-term target. I mean, for example, NPI record pipeline, getting a lot of traction with EGI, Workforce Solutions performing above the plan, great traction internationally porting products from U.S., turned around the PSOL business. And it looks like you're on the verge of what looks to be a very accretive acquisition of Veda, at least by our calculations.","So am I hearing you correctly? And, if so, how do you think about sort of the mid to long-term organic growth prospects of the business based on the hand of cards that you're looking at now?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you for, what I think is a complement to the team. I think you captured that effectively, David. The performance you're seeing in 2013, 2014, 2015 and kind of the early looks of 2016 is a result of the last 10 years of effort of laying a foundation of culture of talent and processes like EGI, NPI and others, and we're now the benefactors of that.","The performance continues to be very, very broad-based across many verticals, many countries, many products. And I feel very good, very good, as I sit here today looking out to 2016 that the growth for 2016 will also be good, as I mentioned. And we're assuming, David, in that 2016 early look, GDP growths in the economies we participate in to be relatively in line with what we're seeing this year, which is modest in the struggling economies in South America, modest growth in GDP in UK, Canada, in U.S., in the 2%, 2.5% range. So we're not expecting significant GDP or market-based improvement. As you look at longer-term, to the heart of your question, 2017, 2018, yeah, I hope eventually we do see some rebounding, some help from the economies we operate in, which would be further wind at our back.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Got it. And then perhaps just expand a little bit, if you would, on PSOL's growth prospects. You've pivoted in the premium channel, you picked up some nice growth there, turned that business around. What you see longer term in the premium channel for Equifax? How can you capitalize on this high-growth channel long term?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think Trey, now Assad, the interim leader, and as you saw the announcements two weeks ago, Dann Adams will take that business over. I think they've done hell of a job, especially when you compare it to the market as a whole, it's changed at such a rapid pace. I think we'll all agree the free market is here to stay. But we're also of the view, after a lot of work, David, with outside consultants, there always be a place for the paid products that we offer. And we've done a number of interviews through third-party consultants that talk to consumers. And a big cross-section of that consumer base wants to and will buy the pay-for products.","Having said that, free is here to stay. It's carved out a nice piece. We're winning, as you know, in the free channel right now through our USIS business, with Trey in his old job. I had a heavy hand working with Rudy on devising a strategy for the Credit Karmas and others in that arena. So simply said, I see the free business is here to stay. I'm convinced the core business can grow in the mid-single digits, with upper 20% margin. I'm convinced our indirect business has got good growth prospects for the next couple years. And lastly, I'm convinced that our International presence will continue to grow stronger.","David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI Institutional Equities","Understood. Congratulations.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, David.","Operator","And we'll go next to Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations on the quarter. And obviously, it seems like a lot of your initiatives are working. The first question I had, Rick, was \u2013 and I think I've asked this many times before is you've talked about your NPI and now, I guess, EGI doing a lot better than last year and probably above your expectations. I guess, can you give us some color, how do you keep delivering these impressive results? And does that 10% NPI number you had before need to go up now to maintain this level of excellence?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you, Manav. Truly, we've got a great team. They believe in the culture of growth. They believe in the culture of helping our customers and consumers by building new solutions we couldn't build yesterday. And we've got the great data assets. We've invested in the Foundation, things like (35:15) You've heard me talk about that. Manav, you too talked about people who see it, everyone understands the importance of innovation.","Our industry is by itself not a high-growth industry. And our team wants to be a part of a high-growth company and the way for us organically to get there is through innovation. And NPI and EGI are such a vital part of who we are and how we think, it's here to stay. We'll continue to always take a step back and refresh our thinking, re-energize ourselves, modify the approach, expand the approach. We're now 10 years into NPI and probably three years into EGI and those initiatives have got to be refreshed periodically to make sure that they're contemporary and thoughtful and the team is engaged. But as long as I'm going to be here, Manav, we're going to continue to strive for 10%-plus Vitality Index, because it's healthy.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just one follow-up on Veda. Clearly, sounds like a good deal. It's a public company. I guess what I was trying to get is, in your diligence, are there a couple of key things that you guys really need to get at, or is this just making sure you're checking the boxes?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, there are obviously. And by no means would I ever go into a diligence process spending any amount of money, let alone $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion, with a mindset that is check the box. We take acquisitions extremely seriously, thoughtfully. And I would prefer not to disclose the exact list of diligence items that we have highlighted. But, trust me, it will be thorough diligence. We're in the data room now. Teams will be in the country in a week. And we have a very thoughtful, exhaustive list of questions that the board and I along with the business unit leaders and COE leaders have thoroughly vetted. So thorough diligence, nowhere close to a perfunctory check the box.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Fair enough. Good luck with that. Thanks, guys.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I first wanted to ask, could you maybe provide a little more insight into how, one, we should be thinking about the magnitude of the contribution from the partnership with Fannie Mae as we do think about our 2016 models for next year?","And, two, we've heard a lot of companies looking more at trended data generally. And so maybe you could talk a bit about how you've seen demand for that product evolve and then we should think about it over the medium-term to contribute to growth.","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. (38:05). The Fannie Mae one, I think it's a great one. It's a great one for consumers, it's a great one for the underwriters and it's going to be a great one for our business units of USIS and EWS. As I mentioned, I think, in my comments earlier on, we expect that to ramp up probably in late second quarter, early third quarter. Some work we've got to do, some building we've got to fine-tune to bring that to market for Fannie Mae. And it will be meaningful impact for the business units next year. I am not going to give you exact number, but trust, it will be meaningful for us at BU level.","Two, if you think of trended data in general terms, I think, maybe two years ago, we started talking to you about trended data and there was an interest in getting a historical look versus a snapshot look. And the first thing we did is, built the capabilities for batch offline, we call it internally CMS. That ramped up nicely. We then through a technology investment we made in USIS and Rick Smith brought that capability to go online and that's now I think up nicely.","I'm also very, very intrigued with the concept on trended data, bringing that \u2013 we're looking at right now, there is a technology requirement as well, we're bringing to EWS the concept of taking one of many different attributes we have in The Work Number database, that attribute being income and showing an underwriter or marketeer, whoever, a historical look, a trended look at their income intellectually excites myself and the team. So as I think of trended data, that will be a next evolution that we'll invest in as bringing trended data towards verification of income.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And one follow-up. I wanted to make sure I heard something right in the prepared remarks. I thought I heard you say that new product pipeline over the next three years will contribute 50% of 2014 level. I want to make sure I heard that right. And if so, how should we actually interpret that in terms of the revenue and growth in 2017 versus 2014?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I believe the comments I made \u2013 I can check my notes here. Well, the USIS NPI pipeline is running at a rate of 50% greater than the pipeline we had in 2014, so that revenue that we'll earn out in USIS over the next three years is up 50% over the pipeline from 2014.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you for clarifying.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.","Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Rick, the 700 clients you've signed for the ACA compliance platform, I know the revenue hasn't started, but can you \u2013 any way to help us size that for 2016 as you roll in? And then second, your International margins, I know you said they'll be up in 2016. They look as high as 20% \u2013 almost 29% a few years ago. Is there anything different with the International business today that would keep you from getting back to those numbers and how many years do you think it takes to get back there? Thanks.","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Paul. I think I've tried to give some color and text around ACA on past earnings calls. One, the caveat I'll give you is, we've always said it will be very meaningful for EWS, very meaningful, and it exceeds my expectations. So far beyond the expectations we had a year ago, John mentioned, I mentioned, over 700 plus accounts, strong interest level already brewing for 2016.","If you follow the ACA dynamics to \u2013 in the level of fines and how those increased over the years and the appeal process, that's going to have a tail that's for many years, as we sit here today and look out. Secondly, and I alluded to it, is getting into this ACA, it can open up other doors and avenues of opportunity we didn't thought about yet, and then the IRS, appeals process, so on and so forth. So I'm not going to give you a number, Paul, but it is meaningful. And very, very \u2013 very important to us long-term, and, again, I think that I mentioned in my comments, probably the most impactful, largest, meaningful NPI we had in my 10 years here.","As far as margins on International, yes, I clearly see 2015 is being the trough, if you will, on margins that was intentional. We are integrating a big acquisition for that BU, investing heavily in the UK business unit, the UK government opportunity we talked about. We're also, as John alluded to in our comments, investing heavily in technology, in analytics and platforms around the International operations to fuel growth short-, medium- and long-term. So we clearly expect 2015 to be the trough and margins to start to ramp up nicely in 2016 and beyond.","Will they get back to 29%? There's one caveat for that. I think they can over time. I can't tell you what period of time, is the team is working diligently now to regionalize big pockets of costs within International and that requires technology investments to take things from countries to regions and so on and so forth. That will be a big benefactor. If we are fortunate enough to close the acquisition of Veda, we clearly expect that on EBITDA margin basis, that also be a nice lift to the EBITDA margins of International.","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Excluding Veda, right, as Jeff \u2013 I think Jeff was taking you through model for International long-term. In mid-term, what we said is mid-20%s is where we are expecting the margins to end up. Yeah.","Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Rick, I wanted to ask you about peer-to-peer lenders, this was a subject that came up recently when I hosted a industry research conference call with the outsell. And I just wanted to know when you look at these peer-to-peer lenders, I know they are using Equifax products today, but I wanted to look further out, do you think these peer-to-peer lending systems will lead to an increase of demand of Equifax products or decrease when it comes to peer-to-peer lenders?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. That's a good question. We spend a lot of time thinking about that strategically. And many do refer to that ecosystem as evolving as you have is peer-to-peer. I'd like to think of as more kind of remote lending, unsecured remote lending rather than peer-to-peer because it tend to be a bank involved in many cases, if you're looking at Lending Club or GreenSky or Biz2Credit or others.","Point one, I think that that is a marketplace that will exist. I think it \u2013 disrupt the marketplace for the traditional banking sector, the banks now choose to participate themselves. But I think it's here to stay. I think it's got good momentum, good legs. As you mentioned before, they are a user of our data today. They use both the verification of employment and income database many times as well as the core credit file and credit scores. We expect that to continue going forward.","So right now I view that as being yet another \u2013 if that sector can allow maybe other people to get access to credit who couldn't get credit in normal system, it's incremental to us. If it's just displacement, the bank would underwrite today, I see it as a non-event for us. The bigger question we're thinking about strategically is how else can we play in that ecosystem. That is truly in five years, 10 years is a big robust part of the market, how do we participate in that market? And that's something we're kicking around right now.","Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. On the Workforce Solution business, I guess, I wondered if you could give us some color on how much of a drag on margins the ACA compliance offering revenues being deferred, but yet you footing the bill for sales and onboarding customers, et cetera. Is this a big drag and would you expect that investment sort of flattens out at the same time revenue comes and that really helps margins starting Jan 1?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, you don't really see like (46:40) said, one, it is important to put that in context with the profile and the path that Workforce Solutions has been on. It has been remarkable in terms of all dimensions, in my opinion, especially margin. I think John mentioned, the margins are up 350 basis points in the quarter. In spite of what you're talking about, kind of investing in ACA standing up with revenue being a subscription model which is earned out over a period of time.","Secondly, and more importantly is, John alluded to in his prepared comments that this business is on a path to 40%-plus margins. And so I think if we put it in context from where it's come from, where it's going, the incremental impact, drag or otherwise of ACA is enough that (47:30).","John, do you want to add to that?","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","That was \u2013 it's very small, right, because, as you know, you defer expense with revenue, right? So it's just very small negative impact on margin. But again, should be accretive to both revenue and margins in 2016.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. And then just to help us frame your commentary on 2016, I know you have not \u2013 have declined to break out the total revenue impact from \u2013 or your estimate from the mortgage market activity. But is it safe to say that in 2015 year-to-date the core \u2013 as you used to call it, the core revenue ex-mortgage market changes would be growing in excess to the high-end of the 8% organic growth. And I guess if that's right, are there any headwinds we should think about as to why that might flow somewhat next year outside of mortgage? Or should we just think that the initial commentary is early and possibly somewhat conservative? Thanks.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me correct that, and John, will jump in. As you think about 2015, I won't to 2016. There's a lot of numbers out there on the NPI Index, growing, I think, Jeff, roughly 17% in 2015. And as it has been in the past for us, you should expect and we are delivering performance that is greater than the index.","John Gamble mentioned that the expectations as we sit here today in mid-October looking at 2016, is that market will be relatively flat and that might mean 2 points, 3 points, 4 points, 5 points down, a couple of points up, in that flattish range for 2016. So as we gave an early look at revenue of 6% to 8% organically next year it is with the expectation of the mortgage being in that range and, once again, our team, that being EWS and USIS, performing at levels greater than that by market penetration and new product introduction in the mortgage market. So that's how we think about 2016.","John, do you want to add to that?","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","No. As Rick indicated right, we just guided fourth quarter as well as next year at the very high-end of our long-term growth rate, so up towards the 8%. And in both of those cases, we've indicated we expect mortgage to be flat or down with the market. So I think that should cover most of the question right there.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Rick, I just wanted to know if you wanted to comment a little bit more on Veda. That company is doing very well. It actually looks more like a mini Equifax. And you touched on it a little bit in your comments. I wanted to know if you could maybe expand a little bit on this. What is it that you bring to them and what is it that they bring to you beyond the geographic diversification?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, Shlomo. One note is, Shlomo, we've known each other now for a number of years and you know our philosophy on acquisitions, so this won't surprise maybe the rest of you or you. We have been talking with Veda now, boy, it dates back maybe four years. So it's not like this thing just dropped out of the sky one day and we said this is going to be an interesting acquisition. It's been an organization that we're trying to get to know each other for a quite some time.","Two, philosophically, it's important to know that when we think of acquisitions, in Equifax, we are driven by a view of what we can bring to that company that makes that company even better rather than what does that company bring to us that makes Equifax better. I think studies will show, and there's been many studies with many consultants, when you take the path of how they help you as a core business, you oftentimes fail.","So having said that, other than the geographical footprint, I think what we can bring there is some of the processes and capabilities that have made Equifax successful the last 10 years in the countries we operate now, things like our Lean process, things like Lean at the customer, things like NPI, things like EGI, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, our Cambrian technology platform, which is fabulous. And as you know, and we have been investing in that for a number of years, bringing that platform to the countries in which Veda operates to link together unstructured internet data, if you will, third-party customer data and our data and build more products than we could build in the past, I think that's a great capability. So it's really deploying some of the things you know so well, Shlomo, that we can play here into their footprint.","I do think that over time and one of the things we'll have to determine, it is clearly not baked into any pro forma assumptions that we have now, but over time, if we have a really good business in that part of the world and we've got really good people, which they do, our ability to think about expanding into other geographies now that the two businesses are much bigger business throwing off a lot more EBITDA, make some investments organically and inorganically. I think when you're closer to those geographies, I'm willing to make those bets. Sitting here in Atlanta, Georgia trying to think about making investments in mid-size countries around Southeast Asia as the hub is a risk I'm not willing to take. But if we've got a good footprint in Australia, New Zealand and a few other countries, that's a risk we're willing to take as a company and that would evolve over the next few years.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you for that color. And could you also talk about how much, either qualitatively, quantitatively, how much of the growth in OCIS was due to the fact that you have significant reseller revenue that is helpful to you this year with some of your initiatives over there?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I tried to allude to that in my comments that I had talked about NPI being very diverse with the core credit business there. I've talked about auto being strong, financial services being strong, resellers being strong, mortgage being strong. So that's power forward with 12% growth. And USIS is delivering good strong broad-based growth. There's no doubt, and we've been very open about this, the mortgage market has helped USIS and they've helped themselves, by the way, by outperforming in mortgage, as has the indirect reseller channel for DTC. But their performance, there's no other way to categorize it other than being broad-based.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Then lastly, hey, John, this one is for you. How should I think of the tax rate as I model out the next several years? As you go more international, should I expect the general trend downward? And, if so, how should I think about it?","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, in general, we would expect that tax \u2013 we've seen a nice trend in the tax rate the last few years down. And we would expect to see the tax rate to probably continue to move positively in the future in terms of positive to us, maybe not at the pace that you've seen over the past several years. But our expectation is you should see some continued improvement over time. We'll talk specifically about 2016, as Rick said, in February.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Shlomo, John, and Lee before him, have kind of helped build a foundation around tax and additional deeper looks at tax over the last X number of years. And that's starting to pay some dividends, paid dividends last year again this year.","One last thought I'd say maybe to add to John's comment is go back to if we're fortunate enough to get Veda, the Australian corporate tax rate is a lower tax rate than the U.S. tax rate and many other countries we operate in. It's about 30%, 30% tax rate, so that would benefit lowering the tax rate as well.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So one follow-up question for you on Veda. You mentioned you've been talking with Veda for four years. So my question is why now? Why Australia? Why now?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a great question. I think, as we've got to know the company more in-depth over the past few years, we're little more comfortable. Two, I think it's an opportunistic time as well and, Bill, there has been some articles written, maybe you probably read them. By the way, I think Manav had a very good write up, that's worth reading as well. The Australian stock market has obviously taken a beating. Foreign exchange has gone from roughly $1.1, $1-point-something to A$1, to $0.68 to $0.72, $0.73 to A$1.","There is the legislation that is passed into law (57:02) from just using negative data to positive data and I think you understand there's been studies all over the world by the IMS and others that talk about how that catalyzes risk-based pricing, risk-based pricing catalyzes growth of lending, that maybe a multi-year look that's going to happen eventually.","So maybe last point is we bought TDX roughly two years ago and we delevered from TDX, we've integrated TDX successfully to the balance sheet, our human capital preparedness is in a position to capitalize on a big acquisition. So all of those things kind of came together at the right time.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Perfect. And then a follow-up for John on Employer Services. Just trying to understand the timeline of the contract in terms of the ACA compliance analytics work, how many months you're looking at typically for implementation during which you're deferring and then typically the length of the contract over which you're going to recognize the revenue?","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yes. So the implementation can happen over one quarter to two quarters generally speaking. And then you're looking at contracts that are often times a year but can be longer than a year, right? So generally, probably, rarely shorter than a year and rarely probably longer than three years, but predominantly closer to a year.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Bill.","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","With that, I think we will conclude the call. Appreciate everybody's time and support. Have a good day. Thanks.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"8884":["Equifax, Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded and at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to John Gamble. Please go ahead, sir.","John Gamble","Thanks and good morning, welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. With me today is Mark Begor, Chief Executive Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including full year 2020 guidance to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the fourth quarter of 2019, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes accruals were legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, costs associated with acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effect of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets.","Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also includes legal and professional fees related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations, as well as the incremental non-recurring project cost designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology and data security infrastructure, as well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems, as well as the cost to manage these projects.","These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security were incurred throughout 2018 and 2019 and are expected to occur in 2020 and 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also as is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, cost related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinean peso-denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website.","I would also like to welcome back Jeff Dodge who\u2019ll be rejoining us for the next several months until Trevor Burns returns from his medical leave. Mark and I would like to thank Jeff for stepping back in, it is greatly appreciated and Jeff has joined us today.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to, Mark.","Mark Begor","Thanks, John and good morning everyone. If you\u2019ve been following the news this week it was another busy week here at Equifax. Before I get into the fourth quarter financial results let me just spend a few minutes on Monday, the Department of Justice and FBI announcement on their indictment of four Chinese military officials for their role in the 2017 cyber-attack on Equifax.","We\u2019re pleased that the FBI and DOJ were successful in identifying the criminals who attacked Equifax and US consumers. Monday\u2019s announcement is another positive step forward for Equifax as we closed the chapter on the 2017 event. Continuing on the 2017 cyber event, you recalled we took $700 million charge in the first half of 2019 related to the comprehensive settlement of the most significant legal and regulatory matters facing Equifax.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded an additional charge of $100 million related to resolution of all remaining US legal proceedings and investigations arising from the 2017 cybersecurity incident. This charge includes settlement [indiscernible] in the securities class action and the shareholder derivative litigation. The financial institutions class action and law suits by states of Indiana and Massachusetts who did not join last year\u2019s multi-state Attorney General Settlement.","The charge also includes an estimate to resolve the remaining open US proceedings and investigations. This charge is net of insurance proceeds related to these matters. The matters for which no estimate is included in this charge are the resolution of the review being undertaking by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK and the Canadian Consumer Class Action Litigation. Consistent with prior legal settlement charges related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the $100 million net charge is excluded from our fourth quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS.","In January the court granted final approval for the multi-district consumer class action settlement we entered into 2019. The timing of when the remaining approximately $360 million of the consumer restitution fund will be paid depends on the resolution of the appeals filed related to this case. The timing of that resolution of the appeals is still uncertain. Details on the status of all outstanding legal and regulatory issues we provided in our 10-K to be filed later this month. Monday\u2019s indictment by the Department of Justice and our resolution of the US matters related to 2017 cyber event allows our team to fully turn the page and focus on our EFX 2020 Security and Technology transformation and growth that Equifax is a leading data analytics and technology company.","Let me move now to our fourth quarter results. We\u2019re very pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter and strong progress in 2019. The results were broad based showed sequential improvement, were above guidance and we\u2019re another very positive step forward to Equifax. These results are our strongest since the 2017 event and reflect Equifax return to a more normal growth more.","Revenue at $906 million was up 10% in constant currency and up 8% on an organic constant currency basis and above the top end of our October guidance. We had strong revenue growth driven by our two US B2B business USIS and EWS. They collectively grew up a strong 13% overall with workforce solutions up a strong 22% and USIS up a very solid 8%. The 22% growth at EWS was strongest since 2016 and USIS\u2019s second half performance was their strongest since 2015.","US mortgage market inquiries remain strong with inquiries up just under 21% and consistent with our guidance. International delivered 4% constant currency revenue growth with growth in all regions in the quarter, but with continued pressure from the slowdown in Australia, Brexit uncertainty in the UK and most recently the unrest in Chile. Global consumer continued their path back to growth with revenue up almost 3.5% and as I expected, improving revenue growth driven by the recovery of our US consumer business.","Adjusted EPS of $1.53 per share was at a top end of our guidance, we provided in October. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.2% grew nicely up 200 basis points compared to 2018. While we\u2019re seeing increased depreciation and duplicate cloud cost as our transformed systems move into production. These costs were in line with our guidance provided in October.","Let me move now to the individual business units. First, USIS; their revenue was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2018 on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Total mortgage revenue was up just over 20% consistent with the growth of the mortgage market inquiries. Mortgage solutions revenue was up 19% in the quarter much stronger than prior quarters in 2019 as we left the negative impact of the mixed shift from a large mortgage reseller which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Our non-mortgage revenue growth grew 3% in the quarter and non-mortgage organic growth was positive again, but up only slightly compared to last year. This was lower than the third quarter and lower than our expectation and reflects the continued choppiness of the USIS recovery that we\u2019ve discussed over the past two years. We saw continuation in some very positive trends in USIS and feel good about accelerating USIS non-mortgage organic growth in 2020.","Online revenue in USIS was up 7.5% on a reported basis and up 4.5% on an organic basis. We saw double-digit growth in mortgage, ID and fraud, insurance and data x [ph], as well as in auto and banking in London. These are all very important verticals for USIS. This growth was principally offset by declines in our telco segment and our direct to consumer segment. Direct to consumer is the segment in which USIS sells credit files in scores to other credit reporting agencies. This was down due to one-time sale that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 that did not repeat. We expect this segment to return to growth in the first quarter of 2020 and while telco saw a decline in the quarter, we\u2019ve very good success with recent customer wins and win backs and expect \u2013 and see a clear line of sight to growth in telco as we move into 2020.","Financial marketing services revenue was up 3.5% in the quarter compared to last year. For full year 2019 FMS delivered 2.5% revenue growth as compared to 2018. While quarterly FMS revenue was still choppy. They delivered growth in three of the four quarters in 2019 which we view as positive. The revenue growth reflects the continuing growing pipeline that we discussed over the past couple quarters in that business.","Sid Singh and the USIS team continue to show accelerating commercial activity through 2019 with good momentum coming out of the fourth quarter and into 2020. Their new deal pipeline is up 15% at year end 2019 versus year end 2018 and new deals won in 2019 increased over 2018 by almost 25% and in the fourth quarter the dollar value of new deals won with the highest it\u2019s been in the past four years.","We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets coupled with our technology investments will return USIS to its traditional growth mode. The fourth quarter and 2019 results show that they\u2019re well down at half. USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 45.1% were down 240 basis points from fourth quarter 2018 primarily due to increased royalty cost as well as higher development expense and investments in data analytics, commercial resources and new product resources.","Shifting now to Workforce Solutions, they had a very strong quarter with revenue up 22% compared to last year which was much better than our expectations. Verification services revenue was up and extremely strong 33% driven by broad based strong double-digit growth across mortgage, healthcare, debt management, auto, government and talent solution verticals. The strong and broad based verification services revenue growth reflects continued growth in work number active records as well as the rollout of new products, expansion into new verticals and addition of new customers. EWS and verification services revenue growth excluding the benefit of the mortgage market were up a strong 12% and 19% respectively.","Rudy Ploder and the EWS team did an outstanding job in 2019 growth their business and expanding the Twin database. Twin has almost 105 million active records at the end of 2019 and over 82 million active unique individuals up 15% from a year ago. These compared to the roughly 170 million including self-employed individuals in the US non-form payroll which gives us plenty of room to grow our database in the future.","As you know these Twin records really drive our revenue hit rates for our customers and benefits to US consumers. Our system to system integrations with our customers allow us to monetize additions to the twin database as soon as they\u2019re added by delivering the higher hit rates to our customers as they access our database and their system to system applications.","Employer services declined in the quarter 6% and in line with our expectations primarily due to the expected declines that workforce analytics, our ACA business as well as our unemployment claims business. The strong verifier revenue growth resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 47%. Margins were lower in the quarter compared to the prior year principally due to incremental third-party implementation and royalty cost associated with the Twin records expansion and some higher selling cost.","Workforce Solutions is clearly Equifax\u2019s best business and they continue to deliver strong results with significant future growth potential. Shifting now to international, their revenue was up 4% in local currency and almost flat on a reported basis. And this was weaker than our expectations. The majority of the weakness versus our expectations was in Latin America particularly in Chile and to a less degree in the UK debt management business.","Importantly, we saw a better than expected performance in Asia Pacific including Australia. I\u2019m encouraged about the trajectory of the international business given the revenue growth posted in the second half of 2019 despite the continuing economic headwinds in Australia, Chile and the UK. Asia Pacific which is primarily our Australian and New Zealand businesses was up almost 1% in local currency in the fourth quarter versus fourth quarter 2018 and 1.5% for the second half of 2019.","Importantly in Australia, we saw our consumer and commercial online revenue which combined represents just under half of Australian revenue growth about 5% in the quarter. We also saw a nice growth in our identity and fraud business and our HR solutions business. We continue to see weakness in our marketing services business which we expect to continue, but at a lesser extent through the first half of 2020.","I was in Australia two weeks ago with our new leader Lisa Nelson, she and her team are focused on returning the business to growth in 2020. We expect local currency Australia revenue growth to return to growth in the first quarter and strengthen in the second half of 2020. The Australian business continues to make very good progress with positive data and by the end of the fourth quarter we had 80% of positive data from contributors including 90% of the credit card and mortgage data for Australia. We expect this additional data to be a new lever for growth for the business in the future.","Shifting now to our European businesses which were up 1% local currency in the fourth quarter and weaker than our expectations primarily in our debt management business. Importantly, our European credit business was up 5% in local currency and improvement from the up 1% in the third quarter of 2019 and their strongest performance in 2019. Consumer online and batch which represents almost 60% of our European CRA revenue was up 3% in the fourth quarter.","Our Analytics and Scores [ph] business and Ignite InterConnect revenue grew double digits in the quarter and this growth was driven by strength in Fintech and financial services. Commercial and ID fraud revenue was weak in the quarter. Our European debt management business declined 7% in local currency to principally in Spain and our debt management business with the UK government did return to growth in the fourth quarter which was positive. However we expect the overall debt management business to remain weak through the first quarter of 2020 at as the Brexit situation normalizes.","Shifting to our Latin American business, they grew a strong 10% in local currency in the fourth quarter of 2019 despite the impact of Chile due to the recent unrest. We saw double-digit constant currency growth in Argentina, Ecuador, Uruguay, El Salvador and Mexico. And we\u2019re seeing growth accelerate as our Latin American businesses benefit from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS customer rollouts and strong NPI rollouts in 2018 and 2019.","Canada was up strong 9% in local currency in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year reflecting a continued focus on customer renovation and new products. Canada continues to be a very strong growth market for Equifax. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 36.4% were up 400 basis points compared to the prior year. The strong recovery in margin reflects both the return to growth in the quarter and the benefit of the cost actions we implemented in the fourth quarter of 2018 and during 2019 as well as improved income from minority investments.","Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions revenue, that business was up 3.5% on a reported and constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, a substantial improvement from the 50 basis point increase in the third quarter of 2019. Global consumer direct revenue which represents just under half of our total GCS revenue was down only 1% in the quarter. Double-digit across the UK and Canada\u2019s combined consumer direct businesses was offset by an 8% decline in US consumer.","Although a slightly greater decline in the US than we\u2019ve expected it still represents a substantial improvement in the double-digit decline in US consumer direct we saw in the third quarter and earlier in 2019. Our GCS partner business increased 6% in the quarter as a result of solid growth with our US partners, our benefits channel and our Canadian breach [ph] business. Our GCS partner team continues to close new logos and their pipeline has grown nicely from this time last year.","GCS adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.9% increased 580 basis points compared to the prior year and increased 200 basis points sequentially in the third quarter of 2019. As expected in the fourth quarter, we saw the effective revenue growth and the benefit of cost actions taken earlier in 2019. The GCS team has done an excellent job turning this business around and returning it to growth.","Dann Adams our leader of GCS retired from Equifax in late 2019 after 21-year career at Equifax. I want to personally thank Dann for all his contributions to Equifax including his President of USIS, EWS and GCS during his career. Dann leaves a tremendous legacy and will be missed. Taking over for Dann is Bev Anderson who joined us after more than 30 years of experience in financial services. Bev joins us from Wells Fargo where she was most recently responsible for leading the growth and transformation of their consumer credit card business and operations. I\u2019m really excited to have Bev join, my leadership team and to lead the GCS business.","Turning now to our technology transformation. In the fourth quarter, we reached some significant milestones in our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 Security and Technology transformation. As you recall, we launched a three-year program in 2018 to migrate our data and applications to the Google Cloud. We made significant progress on the implementation of our US data exchanges and the new cloud-based data fabric [ph] during 2019 and we have some real momentum as we move into 2020.","As of today, initial migrations of the work number and CTUE, auto, Target Connect and our IXI Wealth Exchange in cloud-native environments are complete. We expect to begin delivering in production to customers from these migrated exchanges as early as March. With complete migration of all data ingestion processes and legacy system decommissioning completed over the next six to 12 months.","By the end of second quarter in 2020, we expect to have completed initial migration of our US commercial exchanges, property exchange and our data x exchange and by third quarter of 2020 initial migration of all US exchanges including our property exchange, US consumer or ACRO exchange are both scheduled to be completed. These data migrations to the cloud are meaningful milestones in our technology transformation program.","Our Ignite Analytics and Machine Learning platform that includes Attribute and model management capability is integrated with InterConnect will be fully available for our customer migrations at EWS by the end of the first quarter and at GCP by the end of the second quarter 2020. This will include the ability for customers to easily ingest and manage their own data as well as Equifax data in their own Ignite instance.","We continue to make strong progress globally and rolling out our Ignite Analytics platform with over 150 customers now using Ignite Direct and Marketplace. NDT, our patent explainable machine learning technology has now been deployed in the Ignite development with over 30 customer models. And a few weeks ago, we rewarded our second US patent for NDT. We\u2019re also making progress internationally with our cloud transformation. The initial migration of the Canadian Consumer Risk Exchange and known fraud exchange to GCP and EWS will occur by the end of the second quarter of 2020, with similar progress in the UK and Australia and New Zealand and consumer exchange is expected by year end.","We\u2019re also seeing accelerating progress in the migration of our customers onto our cloud-based InterConnect and Ignite API framework. This is the common set of services on which we\u2019re working to migrate all USIS, EWS and International customers. By the end of the first quarter of 2020, we expect to have migrated approximately 1,000 US customers with similar amounts in International. This pace will accelerate significantly through 2020 with a vast majority of US customer migrations completed by early 2021.","As we\u2019ve discussed customer migrations as certainly the most challenging part of our technology transformation to forecast. But we\u2019re very pleased with customer\u2019s enthusiasm for the benefits of our new cloud-native environment and the accelerating pace of customer migrations. I hope this gives you a sense of the significant progress we\u2019re making in our technology transformation that will deliver industry leading cloud-native technology to our customers. We are laser focused on execution and have continued good momentum as we move into 2020.","Shifting now to new products, this remained a key component of our EFX 2020 strategy and a long-term muscle for Equifax. We have an active pipeline of innovation and new products and we\u2019ve launched over 90 new products in 2019 up 50% from 2018 and up from the guidance we gave you in October. As you well know, innovation and new products fuel our growth and are integral to our strategy. Importantly, USIS product launches were up two times in 2019 and are back to the level that we were seeing in 2016.","EWS also had a very strong new product year doubling their new product launches. Innovation and product rollouts will get increasing focus from our team in 2020 and 2021 as we leverage the unique benefits of our cloud-native data fabric and cloud-based applications to deliver capabilities and new capabilities to our customers. It is a key lever for Equifax growth in the future.","In 2019, USIS launched new or enhanced products in marketing including enhanced email append data x pre-screen and pre-approval of one. And identity and fraud including new Luminate fraud product suite and Synthetic ID 2.0 and in several vertical specific products in commercial which allow our customers to take advantage of our broad and commercial lease payment dataset with the acquisition of PayNet in real estate for lead scoring, a new inside score for personal loans and for the insurance industry new score, the Inflection Score which we developed jointly with Verisk.","EWS also expanded their product offerings through the addition of new data assets including education, property and other data to augment their unique income and appointment data which is part of their path towards being a data hog that centers around their income and employment data asset. EWS\u2019s new product included expanded mortgage product offerings as well as new talent reports to be rolled out to support identification of loan stacking for the personal loan industry.","International also had a strong year with new products increasing launches over 30%, with good distribution across all of our geographies. The strength in international NPIs is driven by over 100 customer Ignite installations at our international customers. As you can see, we really prioritized our focus and resources on driving innovation and NPI rollouts in 2019 and we plan to invest even further in innovation and new products in 2020 and beyond.","NPI has continue to be an increasingly important lever for Equifax growth particularly as we levered to the new product opportunities in front of us from the cloud transformation. We also recently announced new partnership with rent reporting platforms including the Esusu, MoCaFi and Zingo to help develop a more complete picture of our consumers financial profile from rental data. These rent reporting platforms enable customers to often to include rental payment data as a part of their credit report to allow more complete picture of their financial history. All three companies as part of their credit education initiatives will also present their users with a free weekly or monthly vantage score, so consumers can track score changes over time. We believe these partnerships are a win for consumers and a new data source for Equifax.","And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our India business to take 100% control of that business. We view India as a strategic long-term market with tremendous potential with our unique data assets and capabilities. Wrapping up and looking back at 2019, we made tremendous progress in executing against our EFX 2020 strategy. We\u2019re convinced we\u2019ll return Equifax to market leadership and growth as a leading data analytics and technology company.","We have strong operational momentum coming out of 2019 with revenue growth in the second half of 2019 at almost double the pace of our first half performance. This second half acceleration particularly in our US businesses as well as return to year-over-year growth in EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS positions us well for 2020 and beyond. Monday\u2019s announcement of the DOJ indictment along with our resolution of the principal remaining legal issues related to the cyber event is another very positive step forward for Equifax that allows us to close the chapter on the 2017 event and turn our focus fully towards the future growth of Equifax.","Our $1.25 billion EFX 2020 cloud-native transformation has accelerating momentum and we\u2019re now implementing in production major exchanges as well as our Ignite Analytical environment in our cloud-native infrastructure. We are also actively migrating customers onto our cloud-based InterConnect Ignite API based platform and we\u2019re equally energized about all the learning [ph] [indiscernible] power of the new cloud-native environment to drive innovation, speed the market, new products and solutions, always on stability and the cost and cash savings we\u2019ve talked about previously.","We remain convinced that our cloud investment will be transformational for Equifax and drive our top and bottom line in the future. We continued our focus in 2019 on advancing our already differentiated data assets by adding significant new data capabilities in the US through our PayNet acquisition and in our partnerships with FICO, Yodlee and Urjanet. This focus on expanding our data assets will continue in 2020 and beyond.","We continue to make big investments in our data security to deliver on our goal of being an industry leader in data security. In last, we have the right team in place for the future of Equifax. Over the last two years we brought in strong talent to my leadership team and the broader business. We\u2019re all aligned on returning Equifax to growth and market leadership. We\u2019re energized by all we accomplished in 2019 the momentum and the business as we move into first quarter in 2020.","We know we have a lot of work still in front of us, but our focus is clear around executing our $1.25 billion cloud technology transformation while driving new innovation and products that will accelerate our growth in the future. With that, let me turn it over to John.","John Gamble","Thanks Mark. I\u2019ll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but we\u2019ll refer to non-GAAP results as well. In the fourth quarter, total non-recurring or one-time cost related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation excluding the $100 million in legal accruals that Mark discussed were $82 million and below our expectations principally due to lower legal fees. The cost includes $76 million of technology and security and $6 million for legal and investigative fees.","For all of 2019, US mortgage market inquiries were up over 6.5% versus 2018 which is in line with what we had expected in October for 2019 inquiries. 4Q, 2019 inquiries were up almost 21% consistent with what we had expected in October. In the fourth quarter mortgage related revenue represented just over 19% of Equifax revenue. As a reminder, the estimate we provide is for 2020 mortgage market credit inquiries.","We base our estimate on multiple third-party forecast of mortgage originations in dollars including MBA, Fannie and Freddie. Our current forecast originations of about flat in 2020. As we believe only slightly more positive on the order 50 basis points than the current MBA originations forecast of down 7%. Inquiries can be very meaningfully from originations principally due to mortgage tight mix and timing of inquiry versus closed lines.","In the fourth quarter general corporate expense was $211 million excluding non-recurring cost adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $72 million down $4 million from 4Q, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.2% in 4Q, 2019 up 200 basis points from 4Q, 2018 and up 130 basis points from 3Q, 2019. As we discussed in October and as covered in Mark\u2019s comments the increase in overall adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-year is driven by positive mix as high margin USIS and EWS at the highest revenue growth rate in 4Q, 2019.","Growth in margins and international and GCS as well as leverage on corporate cost as revenue grows. Margin declines in USIS and EWS from strategic investments partially offset these increases. The 4Q, 2019 the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 22.7% slightly below the approximately 23% we have provided for guidance for our 4Q, 2019 in October. We expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be about 24%.","Full year operating cash flow of positive $314 million was down, $358 million from 2018. The decline was more than driven by the following non-recurring items; Equifax made payments of $341 million in 3Q, 2019 for the consumer settlement announced in the second quarter, no such payments were made in 2018. And payments related to the $57 million of restructuring charges taken in 4Q, 2018 and 1Q, 2019 were $36 million.","Capital spending or the incurred cost of capital projects in 4Q 2019 and year-to-date was $90 million and $376 million, down $28 million and up $8 million respectively from 2018. Excluding payments related to settlements of litigation or regulatory actions full year 2019 free cash flow was above $250 million and was better than our expectations.","Now let\u2019s take a look at 2020. 2020 is an important turning point for Equifax 2020 Security and Technology transformation as we accelerate the move of our data exchanges to data fabric at GCP. Our customer transitions to our Ignite InterConnect API framework and our identity and fraud customers transition to using our new systems at AWS. As we put our cloud-native systems into production we will begin to depreciate these new systems and incur the cloud and other operating cost of running these new cloud-native systems. It will generally take six to 12 months from the start of production to fully transition a legacy exchange or positioning system to a new cloud-native system.","During that time period we will incur both the cloud and other operating cost of the new system as well as the operating cost of the legacy systems. As 2020 is a transition year and the decommissioning of the legacy systems is not expected to substantially occur until late 4Q, 2020 and 2021. We will incur these additional system transition cost for much of 2020. For 2020 we expect these additional system transition cost to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. With increased depreciation representing about two-thirds of this additional cost and cloud cost net of any legacy system decommissioning savings representing approximately one-third of this cost.","As we move into 2021, we expect the savings from the decommissioning of legacy systems to exceed the incremental cloud cost resulting in a net benefit to the P&L as opposed to the duplicate cost we will be incurring in 2020. As we have said in the past, when this transition is complete we expect to generate significant cost savings of 15% plus savings in technology cost portion of cost to goods sold and the technology portion of cost to goods sold represent just under 15% of our total COGS and the 25% reduction in our development spend both in expense and capital. And we expect our new single data fabric and cloud-based applications to accelerate innovation and new products that will be accretive to our growth rate.","Now for 2020 guidance, we expect total revenue to be between $3.65 billion and $3.75 billion reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 4% to 7%. [Indiscernible] the US mortgage market will be about flat in 2020. FX will negatively impact revenue by almost 1% and adjusted EPS by about $0.03. USIS revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits in 2020. EWS revenue will continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth with very strong growth in verification services, employer services is expected to be flat to down. International revenue will grow mid-single digits with growth strengthening in the second half of 2020 due to expected economic improvement in Australia and Europe.","GCS revenue will also grow mid-single digits in 2020 with continued growth in our partner business at ID Watchdog and in our UK and Canada Consumer Direct businesses. We expect US Consumer Direct to return to growth late in 2020. For 2020, we expect adjusted EPS to be $5.60 to $5.80 per share reflecting constant currency growth of approximately flat to 3.5% versus 2019. As I discussed earlier impacting adjusted EPS in 2020 is $0.40 to $0.50 per share of increased depreciation and additional system transition loss [ph]. This represents approximately eight percentage points of growth in adjusted EPS.","As such excluding this tech transition impact adjusted EPS growth is 8% to 11% which helps give a clear picture of the post-Equifax 2020 earnings power of Equifax. Due to the substantial increase in depreciation, we will in 2020 add to our discussion with you more focus on adjusted EBITDA margins which we believe will better reflect the true earning power of Equifax. In 2020, adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to expand by approximately 50 to 100 basis points. This includes the drag of about 50 basis points from the additional system transition costs. Excluding this transition cost adjusted EBITDA margins would expand between 100 to 150 basis points in 2020.","As we discussed the duplicate legacy and cloud cost will be in place during 2020 and 2021 as we migrate customers to the new cloud environments and decommission legacy mainframe and server environments. In 2020, we expect to incur approximately $255 million in non-recurring expenses comprised of $250 million in non-recurring security and technology transformation expenses and less than $5 million in legal and regulatory expenses. This does not include the cost of any potential judgments or other regulatory outcomes should they occur.","In 2021, as we have stated previously, we will no longer exclude these non-recurring expenses from our adjusted EPS. Capital spending in 2020 is expected to be approximately $335 million. There are several important assumptions impacting 2020 in total as well as the individual quarters. US mortgage market inquiries for all of 2020 are expected to be flat, however 1Q, 2020 inquiries are expected to remain strong up over 21% year-to-year. 2Q, 2020 inquiries are expected to be about flat and we expect inquires to decline about 10% in each of the third and fourth quarters.","2020 corporate costs are expected to increase approximately $45 million versus 2019. Depreciation expense was in the corporate cost line is expected to increase over $15 million. 2020 corporate cost excluding depreciation are expected to increase year-over-year by about $30 million. The increases are principally and security and technology as well as equity compensation.","The higher security and technology cost are partially a result of the system transitions in 2020 as we invest to ensure we maintain high levels of security in both the new cloud-native and legacy systems. As we decommission legacy systems at a more rapid pace beginning in late 2020, we would expect these security and technology cost to moderate. Over half of the 2020 total increase of $45 million in corporate costs will occur in 1Q, 2020.","Interest expense is expected to increase about $13 million or $0.08 per share in 2020 reflecting the incremental borrowings to fund the legal settlement payments in 3Q, 2019 and 1Q, 2020. About two-thirds of this increase will occur in the first half of 2020. Note that our guidance does not reflect any incremental borrowings associated with approximately $355 million remaining in consumer legal settlements as the timing of that payment is still not known.","Our 2020 tax rate is expected to be slightly higher than the 2019 tax rate at 24%. We continue to expect our normal seasonal pattern for recorded revenue and adjusted EPS with 1Q being the lowest and 3Q and 4Q being the highest in dollar terms. However in terms of year-over-year growth rates we\u2019ll expect 1Q to have the highest growth rates for revenue and adjusted EPS. For 1Q, 2020 we expect revenue in the range of $915 million to $930 million reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 9% to 11%.","We are expecting adjusted EPS to be $1.29 to $1.34 per share. FX is expected to negatively impact revenue by over 1% in 1Q, 2020 and negatively impact adjusted EPS by $0.01 per share. Higher interest expense negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.03 per share versus 1Q, 2019. The tax rate in 1Q, 2020 is expected to be about 25%.","And with that operator, please open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and our first question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re using the word mortgage inquiries like you know to be flat in 2020 as your team\u2019s expectation is that supposed to be a proxy for Equifax\u2019s revenue in 2020 for that part of the business which [indiscernible] about 19% and if so, 4% to 7% constant currency revenue growth would be kind of high single-digit non-mortgage revenue growth rate.","John Gamble","The credit inquiries is exactly as it sounds, right. It\u2019s with each mortgage transaction we get an inquiry and we\u2019re simply trying to let you know, what we forecast those inquiries to be for the year and as I said, we estimate that based on the information we have in terms of the number of inquiries that we get per closed mortgage loan and then we use the forecast provided by MBA and Freddie and Fannie to do an overall originations forecast and then translate into credit inquiry. So it does reflect the inquiries reflect, it isn\u2019t necessarily a proxy for a revenue because obviously there\u2019s pricing changes in the year. We also get new records in workforce solutions so we get growth from that and we also launch new products in mortgage which drives our growth higher.","Mark Begor","We also get some penetration with the mortgage customers when they\u2019re using our credit reports or the Twin records, two times, three times, four times in their mortgage process so that\u2019s another part of our revenue model.","John Gamble","Absolutely. As you know historically, we send it to outperform the inquiry index. So it is to give you a view as to what we think the market is going to do in terms of the number of times market will request information for the credit bureaus.","Andrew Steinerman","John, the second part was to do 4% to 7% constant currency revenue growth you\u2019re assuming that 19% of your revenue is headwind, so you would have to do the kind of high single-digit constant currency revenue growth in the non-mortgage segment right?","John Gamble","So certainly our guidance indicates that non-mortgage is going to be higher. Right? It\u2019s going to do kind of \u2013 now again but you have to keep in mind we\u2019ll outperform that EWS for example as they continue to grow records. We\u2019ll certainly outperform in the mortgage segment, the revenue they generate versus that inquiry index. So you can\u2019t just use the credit inquiries or the proxy directly for revenue because certainly we do perform differently than that in certain circumstances.","Andrew Steinerman","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.","Kevin McVeigh","John, if I heard you right it seems like degraded [ph] back the depreciation, the EPS would be $6 to $6.20, that\u2019s a lot better than where the Street is on revenue that\u2019s pretty much inline. Is that the mix in EWS or where else is that leverage coming through in the model?","John Gamble","Can you ask the question one more time, I didn\u2019t fully follow? I\u2019m sorry.","Kevin McVeigh","Yes, so. It looks like there\u2019s \u2013 the depreciation if I heard you right it was kind of $0.40 to $0.50 headwind that deflected of depreciation which would imply $6 to $6.20 versus or your guidance would be $6 to $6.20 versus the Street at $5.80, that\u2019s a lot better than kind of where the Street is, the adjusted EPS versus kind of where the revenue guidance is relative to the Street, is that just the mix that\u2019s driving at and I guess I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s some margin outperformance there. Is that margin outperformance in workforce solutions or am I just not thinking about that right?","John Gamble","So what we indicated it was $0.40 to $0.50 per share for both the increase in depreciation and the duplicate costs we\u2019re occurring because we\u2019re running both cloud systems and our legacy systems until those legacy systems are decommissioned. So that is 40% to 50% and yes, we did say that\u2019s about eight points of growth in the year. So relative to where the Street was, I can\u2019t specifically address that. But I can indicate that, we did in the third quarter pretty specific guidance as to how much we thought our depreciation would go up, right? So I think there was a pretty good understanding generally prior to the fourth quarter beginning following our third quarter earnings call that we were going to see significantly increased depreciation in 2020 and we\u2019re also going to see significant increases in cloud cost in 2020. So I think that information was broadly out there before.","Kevin McVeigh","It\u2019s helpful. And then just with the indictments does that open the potential that maybe you can recover some of those cost driven [indiscernible] writing the incumbent insurance or does that not change the outcome in terms of what you\u2019ve already incurred?","Mark Begor","I think we fully taken advantage of our insurance coverage there as far as any recovery. So our expectation is, that the charges that we took last year and the charges we took in the fourth quarter will be Equifax [indiscernible]. The number we\u2019ve shared with you are net of insurance.","Kevin McVeigh","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Mark, over the course of the year, you\u2019ve talked a lot about how the pipeline is been improving in product and all the progress you\u2019ve made. But at the same time I think in the few quarters where you said the ex-mortgage USIS is being short of your expectations. So I was just curios, if you could maybe help us bridge that gap and maybe what is your expectation for USIS mortgage for 2020?","Mark Begor","Yes, I think that John talked about we expect that USIS overall to be in mid-single digits. With regards to expectations, we\u2019ve got a high bar here, that\u2019s how I operate. I think that\u2019s Manav, you know that we want that business to return to its historical growth rate. It\u2019s making great progress. I think you know a year ago when we were on this call with fourth quarter, 2018 that business was in the flat to negative mode and was just getting out of the penalty box with their customers and we\u2019re now four quarters or so into that recovery. We\u2019re making great progress as far as their pipeline is building, their win rates and we see some really positive momentum as we move into 2020. We expect that business to continue to improve as we go through the year and expect it to return to its historical growth rate, it\u2019s just a matter of time.","It\u2019s still one that the non-mortgage growth. There\u2019s a lot of variables there as far as pipelines being rebuilt and the timing of closing deals that we\u2019ve talked about. Virtually every quarter that since the cybersecurity incident that we\u2019re just seeing deeper pipelines, better win rates which gives us confidence as we go into 2020.","John Gamble","I just want to make sure, to Andrew\u2019s initial question. Just to make sure, I was clear, right so Equifax has historically performed better than the mortgage index in terms of our revenue. So again as you\u2019re doing your analysis on the implications of our mortgage market guidance in terms of its implication to our non-mortgage revenue growth. You need to please recognize and take a look at history of the fact that we\u2019ve generally significantly outperformed the mortgage index in terms of our own mortgage revenue growth.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. John, just two clarifications on the guidance. So one, can you just \u2013 is there any M&A baked into it whether that\u2019s India or any of the other [indiscernible] from this prior year and then I lost you a little bit on the $0.40 to $0.50 of the incurring which year and how that the savings that you said was one-third of the [indiscernible], so can you please just help me with that in 2021?","John Gamble","The only thing we include in our guidance is acquisitions that have actually closed. So there\u2019ll be no new acquisitions included. In terms of the \u2013 I think you\u2019re asking about the $0.40 to $0.50 per share in system transition cost.","Manav Patnaik","Yes.","John Gamble","That $0.40 to $0.50 per share is made up of two things. We said about two thirds of it is incremental depreciation rate, so we\u2019ve been investing heavily over the past several years, building new production systems, cloud-native production systems in the cloud. And as they go into production obviously, we start to depreciate them. So off that, $0.40 to $0.50 we said about two thirds of it will be substantial increase in depreciation in 2020 versus 2019. And then about, one-third of the incremental cost is related to duplicate costs in operations because we\u2019re running cloud systems as well as our legacy systems in parallel for an extended period of time while we migrate customers. So we\u2019re incurring effectively double cost, the cost of the existing legacy premise system as well as the cost of the cloud system during the transition period and we said, that transition cost in the period of running of two sets of systems would be about one-third of that $0.40 to $0.50 per share.","And the final comment I made is, on that specific cost the duplicate cost of running two sets of systems. We had said, as we move into 2021 as we move through the year, we expect that to actually become a positive, where the savings related to shutting down legacy systems will exceed cloud costs and that will start to become a positive for the company.","Mark Begor","And Manav just to add to that, Mark. I think as you know a lot of our investors have asked for some transparency around that because number one, on the second point John raised in the duplicate cloud cost as you know those aren\u2019t going to be here forever and those are going to start, as we decommission system they\u2019ll turn into being a positive, there\u2019ll be some of that in 2020 that\u2019s in our guidance now and the numbers John talked about and that will accelerate in 2021 and we\u2019ll get to fully migrated basis sometime in the future and we\u2019ll give you guidance on that. So that was that element.","And then on the accrete amortization same thing, that\u2019s the temporary element if you will, it will [indiscernible] shall be there for a number of years of that increased amortization which is a non-cash item and that\u2019s going to work its way down as we amortize our investments in the cloud cost. As you know our intention is to reduce our CapEx spending in 2021 as we complete the cloud migration. So our intention is to be clear about our guidance which John gave you, but also give the additional visibility of what\u2019s inside that guidance so you can be aware and think about what Equifax looks like on the other side.","Manav Patnaik","And just what will be M&A contribution, John. I know you [indiscernible] deal because all in that in 2020?","John Gamble","It\u2019s relatively small. Right if you think about, we closed PayNet and I think in the second quarter of 2019 and that was the largest acquisition for the years. In the fourth quarter we gave some indication the total amount of acquisition revenue was just over 1% of revenue so not a significant number and it should decline as you move through 2020.","Manav Patnaik","All right, thank you guys.","Operator","Next question will come from Georgios Milhalos with Cowen.","Q \u2013Allison Jordan","This is Allison on for George, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the comments made about Workforce Solutions margins in the quarter. I think I heard that the year-over-year decline was driven by third-party implementation royalty cost. I\u2019m just curious is there anything else to call out there maybe mix and how we should think about segment margins going forward in 2020?","Mark Begor","Yes, I also mentioned Allison that there was some additional sales cost in the fourth quarter and that business which put some pressure on margins. I think John also said that we expect that business to expand margins in 2020 and we don\u2019t see any change in that, but high growth in their inherent margins that\u2019s a business that we expect expanding margins going forward.","John Gamble","And just to make sure you were clear; the royalty costs are actually separate from the third-party implementation cost. Right? So those are two different cost items that affected us in the quarter as well as obviously increased sales expense.","Q \u2013Allison Jordan","Okay, great. Thank you. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, Mark I heard you mentioned the solid progress being made of positive data in Australia. I\u2019m curious that we should expect any impact from this in 2020?","Mark Begor","Yes, we hope it will be accretive as we go through the year. We\u2019ve seen in all the markets where positive data comes in, it obviously first takes a lot of time to get that data from the contributors into Equifax and the other credit bureaus and then turning that into usable information that we can take to the marketplace as a lag to it. The good news is, we have the data now which we\u2019ve been working to get there so we expect it will be, a positive element for that team in 2020.","Q \u2013Allison Jordan","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.","Q \u2013Hamzah Mazari","My first question is just, if you could just talk about how long your sales cycle today is on new products currently and maybe how much they\u2019re contributing to growth today versus sort of pre-breach, just to give us a sense?","John Gamble","So sales cycle it really depends on the product, so if it\u2019s a batch product something that we\u2019ve sold historically that effectively reselling it\u2019s something that can sometimes be initiated and transacted within a period. For implementing a new online service for the customer the implementation period can be over a year and it really depends on the service. In terms of NPI contribution and new product contribution in 2019 versus prior years. I think what we try to be clear on is the level of acceleration we\u2019re seeing in new products launches which we think is very beneficial as we go forward into 2020 and 2021. Obviously the level of new product revenue we generated in 2019 and 2018 was certainly down from what we saw historically because of the fact that we didn\u2019t have the same level of product generation over the 2017, 2018 period so that was \u2013 so we\u2019re seeing a period of lower new product revenue generation, but we see very good signs that will start to recover as we move into 2020 and then certainly 2021.","Mark Begor","You heard my comments, just to add on that. New products and innovations is a real priority. And it\u2019s one that obviously we had some pressures on following the cybersecurity incident with all our focus on security or mediation everything else and I\u2019m pleased that our efforts in 2019 to make this a priority central to Equifax\u2019s strategy. And you saw the performance of us rolling out, the highest new products in number of years in 2019 and that emphasis is going to continue. We really believe there are cloud transformation and having our single data fabric and having our products in the cloud is going to allow us to even accelerate that going forward and this is an area that we\u2019re going to continue to invest resources, time and money on because of the positive impact it will have in the future around our top line by investing in more new products.","Q \u2013Hamzah Mazari","Very helpful, just a follow-up question. I\u2019ll turn it over. Could you give us a sense of how much of your portfolio is sort of directly linked to the credit cycle versus how much of the portfolio is just data similar to sort of influence services company? Any sense of rough percentage of you know qualitatively any comments there?","John Gamble","I think the best thing I can suggest is, if you take a look at the earnings that we published, we published obviously last quarter and there\u2019ll be one published today. In it, we show revenue by market segment for Equifax and for the each of the business units and it\u2019s probably the best place to take a look to \u2013 so you can judge based on where we sell and how you think that is impacted by the credit cycle, I think that\u2019s the best source for you.","Mark Begor","I think the other thing that you should be aware of it, is you know our business and our industry during a credit cycle obviously expenditures by our customers on new originations may come down but the shift and focus to the back book through managing credit lines. So there\u2019s an element to counter cyclicality to it and then the other element it\u2019s quite different at Equifax today versus the last economic cycle is been mix of our businesses. We\u2019re obviously larger internationally than we were in the last economic cycle and then second, Workforce Solutions is very different scale in our business and size and Workforce Solutions has that additional lever in a credit cycle of the ability to continue to add new data records that are monetizable [ph] so that\u2019s another element of how we think about ourselves, if there\u2019s a credit cycle. We\u2019re very different in a positive way than we were in the last credit cycle.","Q \u2013Hamzah Mazari","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America","Q \u2013Gary Bisbee","I was hoping to dig in a little bit more to the USIS growth organic ex-mortgage slowing from I guess it was three to slightly positive. Part of it clearly understand financial marketing and an outsized growth quarter last quarter and maybe a more normalized trend number. This quarter to that part of it and you called out a couple of the end market that were a little weaker. Can you give us any other color just to understand this and maybe, how we think about the cadence of that into Q1 that will be helpful? Thank you.","John Gamble","I think in Mark\u2019s script where we talked specifically our Direct our D2C business which is the transactions we do with our competitors and part of the reason that was down obviously was because we had a sale that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 that was one-time, that didn\u2019t recur and that directly impacted the organic growth in the period. And then also we talked about telco [ph] and yes it was down, but we think we see very nice path to growth as we get into second quarter and beyond in 2020.","So I think overall, we\u2019re expecting to see nice improvement in our level of organic, non-mortgage growth as we move into 2020 and beyond. So we do like the trend, right we said it, it would be chopping so that doesn\u2019t mean the trend is always straight up, but and we do like the trend. We do see continuing improvement that the sales metrics are very good, the level of growth of pipeline is outstanding and we are very happy with that performance. So I think that overall we\u2019re expecting to see nice improvement in 2020 relative to 2019 in total and certainly relative to where we ended the year.","Q \u2013Gary Bisbee","Thanks and then the follow-up. Just on the pipeline you preferred to improvement in growth, but in absolute terms is like the \u2013 is the pipeline back to where it was in mid-2017 are you still below that? And as part of that historically with NPI you guys talked about a three-year build to sort of mature revenues, 2017 and 2018 you had a lot less product development and NPI. New products as you were trying to fit some of the challenges. Is the fact that you had those product launches in 2019 should we think it\u2019s a three-year process to really get a lot of that stuff particularly in USIS? Getting the business back churning, the way one might expect if you want in normalized basis.","Mark Begor","You\u2019ve hit a lot of the challenges that we\u2019ve had following the cyber event. First was \u2013 we had a pipeline in place the day before the cyber event happened and that pipeline went virtually to zero for the balance of 2017 and through the bulk of 2018. As you know we were on Security freeze for much of 2018 and as we finished 2018 and moved into 2019 we were able to start getting into a more commercial mode when customers grew quite comfortable about our security protocols and our investments and that pipeline has been building rapidly through 2019 and John I don\u2019t know, I believe it\u2019s actually back or above where it was pre-2017 and we\u2019ve seen real growth in that.","We\u2019ve also got a different leader in the business who\u2019s got a real commercial cadence to him, there\u2019s real intensity around pulling that forward. I wouldn\u2019t think about a new product taking a full three years to get to revenue. I think we\u2019ve talked about before there\u2019s a maturity element in that but each of these products have a different cycle dependent upon the customer. you\u2019ve got a customer that the operations team or the marketing team or the risk team really likes the product and then they want to test it and then we go through a contracting process with their sourcing team many times in their course, then you go in the implementation mode which sometimes include their IT team and that could lead some unpredictability in a pipeline that maybe to your point is less mature meaning you don\u2019t two-year old deals in there, three-year old deals, one-year old, six months, you know you have to have that layering.","Our pipeline today is more of call it a 12-month kind of build versus historical we have two and three-year kind of deals in there that sometimes take that amount of time. So I think that layering create some of the choppiness but the fact that the pipelines building we\u2019re seeing better win rates out of the pipeline, in the second half of the year, in the first half which tells us that we\u2019ve got a better pipeline in that commercial activity gives us the enthusiasm about the continued progress of USIS going forward as we get into first quarter in 2020.","John Gamble","Mark specifically referenced new deals one in his script and that\u2019s higher than we saw prior to 2017. So we think the momentum is good.","Q \u2013Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Q \u2013Toni Kaplan","In an interview the other day Mark, you mentioned that you\u2019re about two-third to the way through the tech transformation and you mentioned some color earlier in terms of what you\u2019ve done and what you have left to do? I guess my question is, can you just give us some color on how much risk is left in terms of execution that have a lot of the difficult items been done already or is there still a lot to come and just any color on that would be helpful?","Mark Begor","Yes, a talked a bunch of my comments earlier Toni about that and I think first off as you know, these kind of tech transformations are not for the faint of heart meaning that, you use the term risk. But there\u2019s a lot to do and a lot to work on. We\u2019re three years into it call it, whatever that kind of timeframe. And the milestones we\u2019re achieving around \u2013 when I think about a tech transformation like this and I\u2019ve done them before obviously not at this scale, but I\u2019ve done them before. First of all, you have to make sure does the technology work. Meaning, can we get out databases from our legacy applications into the cloud and I think, you know we\u2019re making a big move of going from siloed [ph] databases to a single data fabric. That\u2019s in place, we did that in 2019.","We\u2019ve started moving our exchanges as you know we have \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the number is, but probably a couple hundred exchanges around the globe close to 50 here in the US. But we have some big ones and we are moving big ones into that new Google Cloud fabric and it\u2019s working. We have customers accessing it. So that\u2019s kind of risk number one, is will the technology work and I think we\u2019re over that hurdle.","The second is, you got to migrate your customers. And we\u2019ve been very clear with you that the feedback from customers is extremely positive. If you think about it, if you\u2019re a customer do you want to do business with a company that has the very latest technology, it\u2019s going to deliver always on capabilities, it\u2019s going to deliver latency in speed that is not possible in the industry today and with security that\u2019s second to none, given the focus on data security.","So customers all want to do it, the wild card there was one complexity I talked about in my comments earlier is getting into their schedule. Every one of our customers has an IT team. They got their own priorities for 2019, 2020 and 2021 and we just have to make sure we fit into that. So that\u2019s that scheduling or forecasting element that I talked about earlier. But as you also heard in the comment we\u2019re really rolling. Meaning we\u2019re moving thousands of customers and so there\u2019s real progress there but it just takes time and of course we need to move all our customers off each of our different mainframe or server environments, different data centers we have in order to decommission those and get the savings that we are looking for from the technology transformation.","So to me it\u2019s\u2019 really around execution and you\u2019ve heard our transparency around the technology element and we feel very good about that and we\u2019re making real progress around the customer migrations, but there\u2019s still work to be done there.","Q \u2013Toni Kaplan","Great and then, with the legal settlement almost behind you pending the final payment. I guess any new thoughts around capital allocation notably like when we could start seeing share repurchases? Thanks.","Mark Begor","I think you were leading me towards our financial framework which as you know we pulled in 2017. We\u2019ve been clear with you that we want to put that back in place. We\u2019re getting closer to that timeframe. We\u2019ve been very consistent. We\u2019ve talked about three areas that we wanted to make sure we had clarity on before we put that framework back in place which will include our capital allocation model. One was, real clarity in the legal settlements and with today\u2019s announcement of the finalization of the US issues. We\u2019re at that stage with that first item.","Number two was the tech transformation. We already talked about that. Really having some clarity about timetable, our execution, our confidence in that and I\u2019d say every day and week we get closer to completing that one and number three is, USIS and we\u2019re way further along than we were a year ago and even in the fourth quarter with our confidence in USIS. So just a long winded answer, that it\u2019s our expectation that the way we are pacing, we\u2019re looking to put that framework back in place for sure in 2020.","Q \u2013Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Q \u2013Bill Warmington","A tip of the hat to, Jeff Dodge. It\u2019s one of those, just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in situations, I think. So my question is, you gave some strong new stats on the new deals one in the fourth quarter. I was just hoping to get some color there. You mentioned some telco [ph] some win to win back, but for the new wins how many are going to new customers, how many are share gains, how many are just additional sales into the same customers.","Mark Begor","Bill it\u2019s probably hard to split, it would just tell you that it\u2019s all of the above. First off, new wins as your competitive takeaway is hard and it\u2019s one, we all work on, but we\u2019ve got a handful of those, so that\u2019s in that bucket. New products are really a fuel for us, whether it\u2019s InstaTouch or Ignite rollout or some of the new products in Scores that we talked about that we got in the market place. Those are bread and butter, really helping our customers grow their originations, solving on fraud. So that\u2019s a positive and then share gains, we had a handful of those too. I think you\u2019re talking about USIS in your comments, that\u2019s where your question is directed. But of course broadly that\u2019s the fuel for our growth in Equifax is to look for expanding either new customers, new verticals, penetration and share gains with existing customers, new products are really a big fuel for growth in. I hope you get a sense of the focus we have around the new products. It\u2019s a real priority of mine. It\u2019s one that I think our tech transformation is going to leverage, it\u2019s going to give us real fuel in 2020 and 2021 and beyond as we go forward to really be more aggressive around funding new products, investing in new products and then bringing into marketplace.","Q \u2013Bill Warmington","And for the follow-up question, just wanted to see if you get an update on the FICO partnership, how that\u2019s been going and maybe some comments on the Inflection Score that you put in together with Verisk?","Mark Begor","Yes, first on the FICO partnership, we announced that last March we were in the marketplace with our integrated decisioning system inside FICO with our data piped in there and we\u2019re in with a handful of customer POC\u2019s, we\u2019ve got a handful of customer wins around the globe, so we\u2019re pleased with the performance with FICO and I think you know, we\u2019re rolling out some products including an AML KYC here in the United States that\u2019s going to be in market in the first quarter and we got some other opportunities there so. So there\u2019s a great collaboration between Equifax and FICO around how we can leverage our respective capabilities in the marketplace and we\u2019ll look forward to that growth going forward.","Score with Verisk is new, it\u2019s just in the marketplace. We\u2019ve had good response from customers so far, I think it\u2019s another example what I like to do and we like to do is really collaborating strong partners like FICO or Verisk to really leverage our respective asset and market capabilities to bring new solutions to the marketplace and that\u2019s just another example. So that much is newly launched in the marketplace.","Q \u2013Bill Warmington","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Q \u2013Jeff Meuler","It sounds like the given the CapEx guidance for 2020, that depreciation is going to continue to build in 2021. So can you give us some sense of once you\u2019re through EFX 2020 and I know there\u2019s some spillover into 2021, what is CapEx go to as a percentage of revenue on an ongoing basis because I think 25% development savings are both OpEx and CapEx. So that would be per one of the questions, so we can get to EBITDA less CapEx.","And then part two, on the 15% plus of tax savings within COGS. Do you get the substantial majority of that on a gross basis in 2022 and I understand there could be reinvestment, just trying to figure out the timing of when you\u2019ll get the step up on that?","Mark Begor","Jeff, you\u2019re leading us quite tactfully into a financial framework so let me give you my best response to that. I think the very good questions in \u2013 first of the CapEx, we\u2019re not ready to give 2021 guidance, but or financial framework for our capital allocation in the future. But we\u2019ve been clear with you that expect number one, the incremental spend that we\u2019ve had in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to fund the EFX 2020 cloud transformation. We\u2019ve been very clear that\u2019s going to come down in 2021 and we\u2019ll continue a more normal rate going forward meaning versus this incremental rate that we\u2019ve had in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and we\u2019ve really shown you what the incremental dollars are so I think you can think about what it looks like on the other side.","And then as you pointed out, we\u2019ve also been clear that we expect to see development savings meaning with a new tax act [ph] with a single standardized set of products, we expect to see savings in the future, so that will be a part of that CapEx, - benefit in the future post-2020 where we get the full run rate will be something will come to you when we put the financial framework in place.","On the operating cost savings, we\u2019ve also been clear that we expect to see inside of our cost structure for technology, real savings from going from legacy to cloud. That is, we have some of that feathering in our guidance within our numbers for 2020, that will continue to accelerate through the year as we decommission legacy environments and that will continue into 2021 and we\u2019re not ready to give run rate on that, but we\u2019ve tried to give you both by sharing what we view is the duplicate cost as well as that guidance around our expectation of 15% to 20% operating cost savings from technology going forward. So you can think about what Equifax looks like in the future as you know, those two benefits with along with \u2013 we expect some accretion to our top line from ability to rollout more new products from the new technology investments are the three benefits that we\u2019re driving as part of this big tech investment.","Q \u2013Jeff Meuler","Okay and then, just how meaningful is this EWS data hub concept like the new data sources beyond [indiscernible] income data just any additional color on that or how many [indiscernible] specs?","Mark Begor","Yes, it\u2019s another element Jeff. I think we\u2019ve been very clear that we think more data results and better decisions for our customers and EWS has a very unique position in a lot of verticals with their income and employment data, that they provide as you know it\u2019s really the only place to go to get that data set and a lot of our customers have to go to other data sets to get other data and either us building that out, us partnering on it or making acquisitions to add those data sets. We think is another lever for growth for EWS.","It\u2019s part of that theme that I view as the \u2013 with the team internally and with you and others in the investment community that while Workforce Solutions is clearly our best business. It\u2019s performing way above the rest of Equifax. We think about it being in the second inning with the opportunities in front it, both in its core business but also in what it can do around things like leveraging its market position and its unique data assets with other capabilities in order to bring more value to our customers.","Q \u2013Jeff Meuler","Thanks Mark. Welcome back, JD.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.","Q \u2013Andrew Nicholas","You touched briefly on your decision to increase your ownership stake to 100% ECIS in India, which obviously is faster in market. Can you talk a little bit more about your business in India today how you think about the opportunity set there? And then any color on ECIS\u2019s competitive positioning that would be helpful.","Mark Begor","It\u2019s a business as you know we\u2019ve been in for long time. We like the market a lot. We had the opportunity and strategically owning 100% of the business makes it easier to operate, easier to control and then we kind of own our whole destiny. So we\u2019re very pleased to move forward on that. I think it\u2019s a market we want to be in, it\u2019s a market that we want to grow. You may know that we\u2019re doing a build of workforce solutions and India is an example, we started that a couple years ago and that\u2019s got some traction on it. We just think it\u2019s a market that we want to play in and one that\u2019s a big market.","Q \u2013Andrew Nicholas","Great and then, just back on organic revenue growth guidance. Just asking another way, can you just walk us through what you consider to be the primary factors that would drive you to the top and bottom and so off that guide, outside of any changes to mortgage inquiry volumes? Thanks.","Mark Begor","Yes, I\u2019ll give you a few thoughts. I don\u2019t want to go too far in this. Obviously USIS is still not back to where it was before the cyber event and we\u2019re convinced. I\u2019ve been very clear it\u2019s not a matter if, it\u2019s only when. Their recovery which we see great momentum, if that accelerates that\u2019s a real positive. For us, near term in, long-term so that\u2019s a very positive one. International, I think as you know, we gave guidance and where we expect the year to be, but we\u2019re still battling some economic headwinds. Brexit while it\u2019s resolved. There\u2019s still some uncertainty on implementation and what it\u2019s going to do to the economy over there, so I think that\u2019s a little bit of a headwind.","Latin America seems to have settled down, but it tends to be temporary there always issues and challenges down there and of course Australia, we\u2019ve seen some positive momentum. The recent wildfires there, some are saying could have economic impact there. So I think that\u2019s another factor in there and then the real positive is obviously, Workforce Solutions has some great momentum, is performing extremely well that\u2019s kind of bedrock inside of Equifax that we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in that they continue to perform, they perform last year above our expectations quite significantly and we expect them to continue to perform very, very well in 2020.","John Gamble","Just wanted to be clear. So we provided overall guidance and we provided mortgage [indiscernible] inquiry guidance. We didn\u2019t give mortgage revenue guidance or non-mortgage revenue guidance and again just to repeat where we started, right? So we did say flat for the total mortgage inquiry market, but people should keep in mind that historically our revenue has performed better than the overall mortgage inquiry market in some cases substantial, so that\u2019s a judgment you\u2019re going to have to make for yourself.","Q \u2013Andrew Nicholas","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Participant","Brian on for George. So I was looking at your 2020 revenue guidance which I know comes below your prior long-term target 6% to 8%. I know you haven\u2019t reinstated financial targets yet, but based on customer conversation. To what degree do you believe long-term growth potential [indiscernible]?","Mark Begor","Again, that is similar question earlier Brian on long-term guidance. We clearly gave our guidance for 2020, we\u2019re not ready to put a long-term financial framework back in place although we\u2019re working towards that in 2020. We talked about the things we want to see and we\u2019re getting really close to that. So I think I\u2019ll just leave it at that.","Unidentified Participant","Okay and then, for your revenue guidance. What level of price increases are baked into that?","John Gamble","We didn\u2019t give specific information on price increases, right. Generally speaking there are some level of price increase in the market. However for credit reports in general, if you think about those, they tend to go down in price overtime. So we haven\u2019t given specific price increase guidance as part of this process.","Unidentified Participant","Okay, great. Thanks.","John Gamble","And operator, we have time for one more.","Operator","Right and our final question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","The company used to just give straight out organic growth excluding mortgage and I was just wondering, there\u2019s a lot of positivity in terms of the sales momentum. It\u2019s not number though that you\u2019re providing now and I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more, just clarity, as the rubber meets the road the organic growth of the business excluding the mortgage is just so that we can track was it a little bit up, was it a little bit down. Where are we doing in terms of actual sales and things coming into revenue?","John Gamble","We actually are giving that \u2013 we gave that number at each quarter last year right in terms of organic, non-mortgage growth. We indicated this quarter it was up slightly, last quarter I think was just under 3% and I think we gave it each of the first two quarters as well. So we\u2019re trying to give that indication and we\u2019re also trying to separately give a view of just what the market did, so you can have some perspective. So I think the depth of information is actually quite good in terms of how USIS is performing to let you kind of disaggregate the performance by piece.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So this \u2013 I\u2019m talking about for the whole company, so the numbers you\u2019re referring are for the whole company?","John Gamble","That\u2019s for USIS.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay and just if I took the whole company together just in mortgage and if I look it as 8.5% growth minus 4% that would be implied by inquires.","Mark Begor","Shlomo, we do give mortgage as what percentage of the total company mortgage revenue is, right. So I think from that you can get a good view as what mortgage revenue is for the entire company and how it\u2019s changing and that information we also provide.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So is it going up or down, let me just \u2013 it\u2019s just a question? If I look at it, the mortgage \u2013 the non-mortgage revenue organically up or down. I know it\u2019s choppy. I\u2019m just trying to see if I can do the calculation, the way I used to do it.","John Gamble","So that isn\u2019t specifically we disclose, right. But I kind of walk you through, what we do disclose and I think the information is available for you to do whatever analytics you like.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay and then what drove the strong EBITDA margins in international?","John Gamble","Yes, Mark walked through that in his discussion. So we got back to growth, they did some very signification cost reduction actions as we take a look at fourth quarter of 2018 and 2019 through that entire period. So their cost structure got nicely better and as they return to growth, they got a lot of leverage from that in the fourth quarter and they also had some benefit from income from some minority investment. So those three things drove higher EBITDA margin.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So is there, where the cost takeouts are the way that we can look at them kind of establishing [indiscernible] that ramps we should be ramping from this kind of level?","John Gamble","The significant majority of the cost actions I think that they plan to take have been executed. So yes, this is kind of basic cost we\u2019re starting from, the base that we ended within 4Q, 2019.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","John Gamble","Okay, we\u2019d like to thank everybody for participating and we\u2019ll talk to you again soon.","Operator","And that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8696":["Equifax, Inc. (NYSE:EFX) Q2 2015 Earnings Call July 23, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey L.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call.","I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax. It will be adjusted for certain items, which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects, an impairment charge related to our cost-method investment in DBS and an income tax benefit generated from a state tax law change.","These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website.","Also please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website, www.investor.equifax.com for further details.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Thanks, as always, for joining us this morning.","By now, you've seen the results and I think you'd agree, our company continues to benefit from our unique and very diversified business model. Also benefits from our high-leveled execution costs, all the BUs, and the centers of excellences, and we continue to reap benefits from the new product innovation that we've launched back in 2006.","For the quarter, both revenue and adjusted EPS exceeded the upper end of our guidance range for all four business units and they delivered revenue growth ahead of our expectations. This reflected both our continued execution of new products and market expansions as well as a stronger than expected U.S. mortgage market.","Total revenue for the quarter was $678 million, up 10% on a reported basis and up 14% on a local currency basis from the second quarter of 2014. In the quarter, FX created a $19 million year-on-year headwind, up from the headwind we experienced in the first quarter, up $17 million.","Operating margin for the quarter was 27.8%, up from 27.3% in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.15, up 20% from $0.96 a share last year and significantly above the upper end of our guidance range.","As I always do, let me \u2013 before John gives you some financial details, I'll go through some of the business unit highlights, as well as some of the corporate highlights. And then, we'll go into the details of the financials with John.","The power of our Decision 360 initiative which you by know are very well aware of, combined with our enterprise selling strategy and our mortgage market success, enabled USIS to once again deliver very strong broad-based 12% growth.","Our recently launched data and analytics environment which we've introduced to you and we call it Cambrian has positioned us to develop and deliver new D360 products at speeds that once took weeks, now take us minutes. This is something you'll recall we've talked about now for probably two years and that is now fully in production in the U.S. and making a big difference.","The primary goal of Cambrian is to source and integrate structured and unstructured data from any industry, anywhere in the world, and proactively deliver actual insights valued by our customers. What is particularly compelling is that we can now create transformational solutions by combining traditional trusted data with other Big Data sources in cutting edge analytical capabilities with greater ease and speed.","Cambrian will help us discover new data assets through our research and\/or our partnerships that will further broaden and deepen our portfolio of data assets and fuel new product innovation. Presently for Cambrian, the environment is focused on our U.S. based data assets and market opportunities, however, as we've talked in the past, we'll be developing significant domain expertise that will enable us to expand into our international geographies over the next 6 months to 12 months.","Moving on, and in the auto vertical in the U.S., we recently launched the first of three products in the Power Lead suite which leverages our data assets to help auto dealers be more effective in their marketing activities. They leverage third-party service providers or connectors as we call them. We help dealers leverage their website performance by turning anonymous borrowers into known high quality leads. Consumers are now more empowered by getting their credit score online after being authenticated with our eID Verifier services, and all this information is with consumer authorization that's then shared with the dealers.","Our partnership with Credit Karma I think we talked to you about that back in the very end of 2013, early 2014. That continues to be \u2013 is that right? 2014 and 2015, yeah, at the very end of 2014, sorry about that. That continues to be a very important revenue contributor to USIS and is off to a great start this year. We now expect the revenue in the relationship with Credit Karma for 2015 to expect \u2013 to exceed our original expectations.","Staying in USIS, in the utility sector, we launched our \u2013 the first of our four markets, specific insight tools, leveraging third-party data alongside our credit information and our telco and utility database. These insights will help utilities optimize their deposit strategies to better manage and control portfolio loss rates.","Our Commercial Solutions business within USIS, their product offerings in business unit had a very strong performance in the quarter with both accelerating revenue growth and improved operating margins when compared to the first quarter of the year. Mortgage origination activity exceeded our expectations for the quarter and driven by our strong market position, contributed nicely to USIS's growth and margin expansion. Our fraud and property valuation product offerings continued to deliver very strong double-digit growth in the mortgage market as well. We'll talk obviously in the Q&A more about mortgage and where we think that's headed.","Finally, our partnership with Jumio which we've talked to you about in the past has secured its first mobile commerce authentication service with a major telco. The application includes validation of an end user's photo ID along with facial biometrics, a first for us. While we expect the mortgage growth to decelerate for the remainder of the year, we expect USIS to end 2015 with double-digit organic revenue growth and operating margins comfortably exceeding 40%.","Let's move on to International. They continue to make very good progress on their critical strategic growth initiatives, including the integration of TDX, implementation of the UK government contract and continue to drive innovation through new products around the globe. Revenue in International's three largest verticals, which are the financial institutions, telcos and SMEs grew 13% for the quarter.","The decisioning platforms, analytics services and debt management revenue grew 17% for the quarter. TDX delivered another quarter of 20% plus revenue growth, a trend we expect to continue as we move into the third quarter. Also we are in the process of entering the Canadian and Brazilian markets with TDX products and services.","We're also meeting all of our operational readiness commitments within TDX or the UK contract that we've talked about in the past. Equifax data has been integrated into the TDX workflow for developing the consumer insights and appropriate collections strategies. The IT infrastructure build has been completed and security penetration testing is largely completed.","20 debt collection agency contracts have been signed after vetting with the UK government, and as we've mentioned to you in the past, we expect this to be operational late fourth quarter, early fourth quarter, modest revenue this year and ramping up nicely in 2016.","Moving on to Latin America, we've identified opportunities to set up exchanges, much like we do in the U.S., where critical data assets are not currently available. We've already received regulatory approval in one country, and we'll be finalizing our plans by the end of the year. As you know, the exchanges have been very successful in the U.S. with good margins and good competitive differentiation, helping our customers in ways we couldn't help before. We're really excited about what this might bring us in this one country. If it's successful there, bring it across to other Latin American countries.","In Canada, we launched a six-month pilot for an e-commerce site to provide online delivery for our business and consumer credit product offerings. This distribution channel will be very attractive to our SME customers, while also addressing a growing market demand in other verticals and potentially other geographies.","And we recently signed a global agreement with a large, international telecom to create new analytical insights using telecom usage data. Ultimately the analytical insights will be sold to financial institutions, retailers, and other customers in our served markets to facilitate decisioning on consumers who have limited or no credit information. This partnership is significant for Equifax as a new source of rich data for consumers in Latin America, which is typically a negative data-only geography.","We're starting with risk scores that are developed from our telecom data to address the pain point of FIN (10:42) file and no-hit at the point of acquisition. Over time, we'll expand this beyond account acquisition to other decisioning needs.","For the full year, we expect the International revenue growth to be solidly in the upper end of their long-term growth range which is 7% to 10%. We continue to grow \u2013 invest in their long-term growth initiatives.","On to Workforce Solutions; they again delivered an outstanding broad-based 23% revenue growth and a operating margin of 38.3% and they're doing a great job of executing with precision on their strategic objectives.","Revenue from all of our Affordable Care Act initiatives continued to accelerate nicely. And with the recent Supreme Court decision, we anticipate continued strong demand for our product offerings in this area. Our ACA platform solutions, which enables companies to know the extent of their compliance with the Affordable Care Act, continue to benefit from very strong interest. We now have contracts with numerous employers, who in aggregate now have 10 million employees on their payroll.","In June alone, we signed 62 new customer contracts. We're uniquely positioned to add value in the healthcare vertical and we will be making important investments to drive further long-term revenue growth and market penetration.","The strong growth in Verification Services was driven by \u2013 continue to add records, new records to The Work Number database, also double-digit growth in mortgage originations, and continued penetration of non-mortgage market verticals.","In the quarter, our non-mortgage market Verification revenue grew 21%, virtually every vertical were in strong double-digit for the quarter, outstanding performance.","Growth in mortgage-related revenues decelerated in the second quarter, a trend that we \u2013 will continue \u2013 that will continue for the remainder of the year. However, Workforce Solutions success on many of their strategic initiatives should continue to drive very attractive revenue growth. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth to be in the upper teens with margin expansion over 2014 of at least 400 basis points to approximately 37%.","On to PSOL, PSOLs growth exceeded our expectation, driven by double-digit growth in our indirect channels and our International segments, in addition to winning two breach contracts. Revenue growth for our direct-to-consumer activities in the U.S. continues to be driven by higher average revenue per subscriber and lower churn. They've done a great job on both ARPU and churn. PSOL is making good progress on their transformation efforts and we expect full year organic revenue growth to be at the upper end of the long-term range of 4% to 6% and operating margins for the full year solidly in the range of 25% to 30%.","So again, before I go to John with the financial details, let me give you some highlights at the corporate level quickly. Some things we've talked about in the past that are very critical to our sustained organic growth.","You've heard me talk about NPI 2.0 and you've heard me talk about EGI as critically important growth initiatives. In NPI 2.0, we've developed detailed metrics to better manage our pipeline of opportunities to more effectively allocate our resources and track our success on product launches, and to minimize time to revenue. Midway into the year, we are now 10% over our revenue target and so the team is doing a great job of executing again in NPI.","Enterprise Growth Initiatives, we call it EGI, where we're focused on larger, more complex projects that frequently engage multiple parts of the organization but also have a much bigger impact on our revenue growth. EGI is delivering again 1 to 2 points of revenue growth annually for us.","In Global Operations, that COE continues to make important contributions to our bottom line. Within the operations COE, you've heard us talk about LEAN initiatives which traditionally have been used internally. We've talked a lot about that. However, with the increased level of competition and regulatory requirements in many of our industry verticals, there are many new opportunities for incremental revenue growth when we leverage LEAN within our customers operations.","Our global LEAN teams now are currently engaged with over 20 great customers, helping to drive operational improvements that are critical to their success while adding yet another element of differentiation for our business in the marketplace. So our customers become stronger, more efficient and it helps us differentiate versus competition and secure incremental revenue.","On to our fraud and identity management business, they're presently broadening to incorporate biometrics in mobile device resolution via partnerships. We're also looking to taking on more successful products and launching them in other geographies. It's a practice we've done in other parts of the business. Now we're intentionally taking fraud and ID products from one part of the world to other geographies where it makes sense.","In summary, the business is off to a solid start this year with high levels of execution across many of our strategic initiatives and we're well down the path of changing Equifax from a credit bureau into a truly diversified information solutions company. Our domain expertise and analytics and technology enables us to increasingly deliver powerful insights to our customers and enhance their decision making.","All of our business units continue to work hard to deliver on their commitments to the company, our customers, employees and shareholders. And as we move into the second half of 2015 and start to look at 2016, I strongly believe the prospects for consumer credit and the developed markets in which we operate, especially the U.S. look very good. The dynamics are shaping up as a sweet spot now for consumer credit growth.","And with that, let me turn over to John for the financials. John?","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. During the quarter we recorded an impairment charge of $14.8 million or $9.8 million after-tax related to our cost method investment in DBS. The impairment is in general a result of the weakened economic situation in Brazil. We also recorded an $8.6 million after-tax gain due to a state income tax benefit resulting from a state tax law change enacted during the quarter. The net of these two unusual items was negative $0.01 per share. Consistent with our past practice for treating unusual or infrequent items, we've excluded these items from our adjusted EPS in order to provide investors with a more consistent period to period operating comparison.","Now let me turn to the business unit's financial performance for the second quarter. U.S. Information Solutions revenue was $360 million up 12% when compared to the second quarter of 2014. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million up 13% when compared to the year-ago period. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $33 million up 20% compared to Q2 of 2014, this compares favorably to the mortgage bankers application index which was up 16% in the second quarter. Financial Marketing Services revenue was $50 million up 4% when compared to the year-ago quarter and the operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 42.1% up from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2014.","International revenue was $148 million down 1% on a reported basis, but up 11% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $63 million down 1% in U.S. dollars but up 12% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $51 million up 6% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Canada revenue was $35 million down 10% in U.S. dollars, but up 2% in local currency.","For the second quarter, International's operating margin was 19.9% down from 21.9% in the second quarter of 2014. Although the operating margin fell short of our expectations, we have a number of very exciting growth opportunities Rick has discussed that were an incremental investment and management focus.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $146 million for the quarter up 23% when compared to the second quarter of 2014. Verification Services with revenue of $94 million was up 30% when compared to the same quarter of last year. Employer Services revenue was $52 million up 11% compared to last year, growth was aided by our ACA analytical solution and further progress with Compliance Center.","The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 38.3%, compared to 33.9% in Q2 of 2014. Personal solutions revenue was $68 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 8% on a local currency basis. For the second quarter, operating margin was 27.6% compared to 30.9% in Q2 of 2014. This margin is consistent with our longer term expectation for this business, as we primarily driven by increased marketing expense during the quarter.","In the second quarter, general corporate expense at $48.5 million was slightly over the guidance we gave last year. The increase versus our guidance, and from the $36.6 million in 2Q of 2014, was principally due to increased incentive compensation expense due to our very strong performance in 2015. We also had increased salaries and benefits, and other investment expense, primarily related to our key strategic initiatives.","Looking at the third and fourth quarter, we expect general corporate expense to be approximately $45 million per quarter, consistent with 2014 levels.","Operating margin at 27.8% was very strong. Operating cash flow was $187 million in the quarter. We continued our aggressive stock buyback activity, repurchasing 0.9 million shares for $92 million and paying $34 million in dividends to our shareholders.","With that I'll turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect continued favorable economic conditions in the U.S. span the majority of our non-mortgage verticals. I'll talk about mortgage in a second. Internationally, we continue to expect uneven economic conditions across Europe and Latin America.","Our view of the U.S. mortgage market in the second half of 2015 is roughly consistent with our prior guidance as we expect U.S. mortgage market originations to be up slightly in the second half of 2015 versus the same period of 2014. We are, however, increasing our full-year view for 2015 mortgage originations to be up somewhere between 11% and 13% versus 2014.","The U.S. mortgage market was stronger than our expectations in the first half of the year with originations up approximately 20% versus last year. And again, we'll talk about the nuances and the impact of moving from a refinancing mortgage market to a purchase market, which we are in the process of doing, the benefits that has for our company.","For the third quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $655 million and $670 million, reflecting constant currency organic growth between 10% and 12%, partially offset by about 3% FX headwind. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.08 and $1.11 a share, which is up 7% to 10%, excluding $0.03 per share of negative impact from FX. This reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 13%. We also expect operating margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5% for the quarter.","For the full year, we've again increased our guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS. We expect now 2015 revenue to be between $2.645 billion and $2.67 billion, up from our previous guidance which was $2.585 billion to $2.635 billion and reflects constant currency organic revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. This strong revenue growth is partially offset, again, by approximately 3% negative FX impact. And as before, this is all organic revenue growth.","2015 adjusted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.42 a share, also up from our previous guidance and this reflects 13% to 14% EPS growth for the year. On a constant currency basis excluding $0.10 per share negative impact of FX at current rates, this reflects 15% to 16% growth for the year compared to 11% growth in 2011.","In summary, we're also more intently focused now on strategic inorganic growth as we have developed a more robust pipeline of potential opportunities, now that we have fully integrated TDX into our operations. So as we've talked to you in the past, intent was to be more focused on that as we exit 2015 and into 2016, we're ready to do just that.","So that's all the prepared comments. So, operator, if you could please open up for Q&A for John and I, that would be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We'll go first to Andre Benjamin at Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I was hoping to maybe dig a little bit more into Verification. I didn't know if you would be able to provide any color on how much of the revenue is coming from your success penetrating autos versus the ACA contract which has been ramping nicely versus other verticals? And if there are any others, maybe a little bit of color on where you're seeing the most traction?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. As I briefly alluded to in my comments, the trends we saw emerging in 2014 and clearly into the first quarter of 2015 are continuing. It is extremely broad-based. So think about the growth, first and foremost on the Verification side being, as we continue to add records, that's all incremental revenue right there and they've been adding records for a long time now. Secondly, Mortgage obviously is strong. Third as I alluded to in my comments, almost every \u2013 in fact I think it is every non-mortgage vertical is growing strong, strong double digits. That's pre-employment, that's collections, that's automotive, that's card, I can go on and on and on, extremely strong. And then as you mentioned the Workforce Analytics, we continue to add customers there, I said 10 million. Consumers are now being or employees are now being monitored and 62 clients alone in the month of June. So it is as broad-based a performance of growth as you could hope for in EWS. It is just spectacular.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then in the indirect channel you mentioned the Credit Karma relationship continues to ramp and contribute nicely. One, are you willing to disclose any amount that that is actually contributing? And two, as that seems to be performing a little bit better than you expected, how are you thinking about the potential to aggressively push to work with other partners?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great question. It's still early, so we gave you a number earlier in the year, it's ahead of that right at this juncture, but we still have 6 months in the year to go. So it's hard to say where that goes for the full year at this time. It's been very successful. We like the model and as we've talked to you in the past, we look at that deed to see be it through a business to a consumer or direct-to-consumer as one unified strategy. So in this particular case we have our PSOL unit and USIS working together strategically to make sure this makes sense not just short-term but long-term. And, yes, there's nothing to prevent us from looking at taking the success we've had with Credit Karma and either doing it ourselves directly or doing it with other indirect players.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Meuler at Baird.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thank you. I guess one of the things that jumped out to me, Rick, is even getting out to Q3 as you start anniversarying the mortgage weakness, still guiding to 10% to 12% constant currency growth. And as you talk about the business, it sounds like almost every business unit is at or above the long-term guidance ranges. So is there anything that is unsustainable in the growth rate? Or said another way, when you're in the sweet spot of the consumer credit cycle in some of the larger developed markets, can you sustainably grow above the longer-term targets?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's obviously something we'll develop over time. It's something we keep a close eye on, Jeff. It depends on the horizon you're looking at. It's specific to the third quarter guidance, maybe the second half guidance. You're right, it's not just every business unit, it's the sub-business units within those business units, and the sub-sub. So that could be the auto vertical within International, but also the auto vertical within all the countries in International performing extremely well is very, very broad-based and their executions at extremely high level.","Let me use your question to respond to something I briefly alluded to in my comments, which is the nuances of mortgage and how mortgage impacts our thinking for the balance of the year and next year. And you guys know this as well as we do, the world is going, the U.S. market is going from a heavily refinancing distribution to now back to more the normal distribution, which is heavily skewed towards purchases and less and less towards refinancing. And while the overall mortgaging market will soften, I think it clearly is going to soften second half of this year versus the first half, 2016 will be less than \u2013 maybe modestly up from 2015.","The nuance that's positive for us is that when you go from a refinancing market to a home-purchase market, it's actually a benefit. In many cases, individual bank policies may not require them to pull a VOE\/VOI: verification of employment, verification of income. When you do a purchase, they pull a VOE\/VOI. Secondly, when you go to a refinancing, from refinancing to purchase, you're going to pull, as we've told you in the past, far more credit files. Your broker may pull the credit file; you, as a consumer, may shop the four different banks, five different banks, each time pulling a file. In refinancing, you don't do that. They may pull one file. So even though the mortgage market growth rates will slow as we go forward, including in third quarter, we think there's some hidden gems in there for us as you rebalance to a purchase market.","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Also, as you do the math on the full year, since we've given you full-year guidance and guidance for the third quarter, as you back into the fourth quarter, what you see is our revenue growth rates, on a constant-currency basis, are moving back down toward our long-term averages. Right?","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. And then I know NPI 2.0 is still a little bit early, but are you seeing signs that you're going to get more, call it, extra-base hits out of the NPI 2.0 products?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Clearly. I alluded to that, I think, in my comments that we had exceeded our budget by 10% for the quarter. But it's that combined with the topic we've talked about now for a few quarters, which is Cambrian. You can't underestimate; this has been a multi-year heavy investment that now gives us the ability to partner with our customers and build products in seconds, where it used to take weeks or months, and that fuels NPI as well.","Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you and hats off to you and the broader team.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum at Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey, Rick, I was wondering if you could, if not quantitatively, maybe qualitatively talk a little bit about the volume, the growth that's in USIS. Maybe where you're getting tailwinds or how much you can attribute to tailwind from the end markets, which you've talked about, is getting better? And how much more just some of the initiatives that you've been very aggressive about for like, besides the Credit Karma, there is also things like fraud initiatives, ID identification and other things out there? So I guess how much is market versus how much is you guys just trying to anticipate where the best places are to be?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good question. I think there's no single answer. I'd say, generically, in the U.S. and I think I said this somewhere in my comments, we're expecting improved economic environments. I talked about moving to a sweet spot in consumer credit as you exit this year and go into 2016. It's not robust yet in the U.S.; it's improving. The nuance or the difference there would be the automotive, obviously very strong and we've benefited from that. But we've also benefited \u2013 we're growing at rates multiples of the automotive growth rates as you know, Shlomo, through our Connector Strategy, which we're partners, and new product introduction. Card, we're seeing pre-screen pick up, which is encouraging, and that should lead to more card revenue going forward. Insurance is strong, retail banking is strong. So it's fairly broad-based.","But the heart of your question is other than automotive, the majority of the USIS growth that we're experiencing is not \u2013 some of it's economically driven, but more of it's driven by new product innovation, more spend with our customers, leveraging D360, things like that, versus the market itself.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's what I'm getting at. So your sense is that it's being in the right places and the initiatives that you guys have put forward versus just the rising tide lifting all boats?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I think the rising tide will lift all boats eventually, but yes. We've been at D360, for god's sake I think it's in 2007, so eight years. And all the things we've done by leveraging D360, then building Cambrian, building NPI, it's those things by and large that are driving more of our core organic growth in the U.S. than it is the economic environment.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And then just turning to International, clearly top line growth and the ability to drive the top line is the key. Can you talk about the things that impacted the margin that are really longer term efforts that you're making towards driving that top line growth?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, absolutely. It's consistent with what we've talked about before. There's two big things we're doing. And one, the beauty is, Shlomo, before I give you the two things we're doing, is John and I have the luxury to invest in areas where we need to invest, and PSOL is one of them. We've been investing in that for a couple of years as an example. We told you we'll accelerate the growth there from our competitors, but the margins will come down 25% to 30%. We also told you we're going to invest in International for long-term growth and profitability. We can do those things and still give you \u2013 we've told you what we're going to do, which is a 25 basis point to 50 basis point corporate margin expansion. We've done that and I think margins were up 120 basis points in the first quarter and 50 basis points in the second quarter.","Specific to your question, though, there are two things we're investing in, in International, which I firmly believe benefit us long term. One is the government contract we talked about in the UK. That is a large, complicated investment that we've had to make that's required resources from around the globe to stand up this environment to be ready to go live end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter. And I think we've talked to you about that now as a group for a few quarters. So that's one.","The other has been with our ability now to standardize platforms, we're now going to regional centers in International, and there's a cost associated with moving from replicating processes in every country to regionalizing those processes in fewer countries. So there's an investment required to get this. Those are two things we're investing in now as well as NPI, but we always do that. That will bode well long-term, but create some headwinds in margin short-term.","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And just near-term, what you're seeing in the first half of this year is we just have a revenue mix change, right? We talked about Canada being a little weaker, a lot of it because of FX. There's an FX impact, but also, Canada is a very high-margin country for us, similar to USIS. So when Canada is weaker, it affects our International margins.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great point.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Last one, just if I can squeeze in. Hey John, how much more can you squeeze out of these DSOs? You have pretty healthy DSO. They continue to trend down. Is there really room to go over there when I think about cash flow, or how should I think about that?","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","That continues to be an area of focus. Obviously, a lot of that's driven by mix as well. DSOs internationally are a bit higher, and since you've seen pretty good local currency growth internationally, that does negatively impact DSOs. But it's something we continue to focus on and, obviously, we'll hope to squeeze them down over time.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Paul Ginocchio at Deutsche Bank.","Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Just the 62 contracts in ACA analytics, how does that relate to the total contracts? And then just on the acquisitions, I would assume you're focused on more consumer data than, say, industrial data. Are you looking for tuck-ins, or you're thinking about doing \u2013 is there something larger out there or are you ready for larger deals if they're available?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Paul. Thank you. I can't recall \u2013 does anyone here recall the number of contracts we signed in EWS? Hold on, I'm looking at the guys; we're getting different -we have \u2013 Jeff, what's the number?","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Over 200.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","462.","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","462 by the end of the year.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And 62 signed, and he's saying \u2013 how many contracts have we already signed year-to-date? Okay. I'm being told, Paul, because I don't have it off the top of my head, over 200. So 62 in one month is a big number.","Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the second question on acquisitions, thank you, team, for your great work there. On acquisitions, yeah, probably not sure I can disclose the details, but yeah, we do a good job of tuck-ins. So it would fit our strategy, which is data analytics, geographical expansion, and I'll leave it at that.","Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll move next to Gary Bisbee at RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a question on Workforce Solutions, and particularly the work number. It's obviously been a terrific asset as you've built out the database and expanded the end markets that that data's used in. How much runway's left on each of those strategies? And I guess, looking at the \u2013 outside of mortgage, which can move around, you've seen pretty steady acceleration in that over the last year. What could slow the non-mortgage growth there as we think over the next year?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Gary. Let me regress for a second, since I think we now have the actual data for Paul's question. Paul, on the Workforce Analytics, contracts signed last year was 244 for the total year 2014, ramping up nicely. It'll probably be more than that this year and 62 within the month of June alone.","Gary, back to your question, what's driving and how sustainable is the non-mortgage growth in EWS, was that the heart of your question?","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, just the work numbers seem to have gained a lot of momentum in the last year, that...","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","...and what's the runway on that? How sustainable is it?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Very sustainable. Dann has done a hell of a job taking a very good business and bringing it to a new level. When we told you, we talked about this for quite some time, we have a path to get the records up to 300 million and every time you add a record, you get multiple bites of the apple, it becomes more valuable for more verticals. You have revenue added just incrementally for that record being added. So that's one.","Two, Workforce Analytics are in the very early stages. The IRS piece of the Workforce Analytics goes live in February of 2016. So we haven't even experienced that revenue growth yet. The non-verification piece of EWS, we've got a great leader in there doing a great job of thinking. That business no longer is just protecting the work number but innovating, investing in efficiency for our customers and making the customer experience better, taking that business from virtually a no growth to a nicely growing business. So as I look, Gary, at the portfolio of assets we have, I have told our investors this time and time again, I think they're all really well positioned for long term multi-year growth. The one that's got I think the most significant growth opportunities over a multi-year period of time is in fact EWS.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And given that, I guess, what are the prospects to try to begin to build something like the Work Number in other countries? It seems like it's been such a home run that I realize it probably would take years, but is that something that's on your radar?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Clearly.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yep. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Manav Patnaik of Barclays.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Obviously there's a lot of good internal initiatives, like you said, driving a lot of that organic growth. I just wanted to touch on your comments on we're entering the sweet spot of the credit cycle. Can you give us some reference from your experience how long that cycle can last? What are some of the signs to look for in terms of how well that's progressing? Maybe just a little bit of color on that.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. I'll give you my view, but there's others, economists that we obviously deal with that could give you their view, banks will give you their view. But here's why I described it that way. I intentionally described it in our larger developed markets, so the UK, Canada and U.S. I underlined or underscored particularly the U.S. What you've got is the emergence of obviously higher employment rates or unemployment rates starting to see wage growth, starting to see home price growth, continued home price growth, consumer confidence is growing. The banks are stronger now than they have ever been, so their ability to lend to those that want to borrow is as strong now, is becoming as strong now as it's been since maybe the 2005, 2006, 2007 timeframe. So that's why I'm saying I feel like in those countries specifically we're moving into what I view as a sweet spot for consumer credit. Obviously that benefits us.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just in terms of \u2013 Rick, we always talk about the NPI and the aspirations have obviously continued to push that goal up. It sounded like obviously even though this quarter at least significantly exceeded your expectations. Can you \u2013 I think in one of the previous questions you said momentum looks like it should continue. But, real preliminary looking into 2016, do you still think you guys will continue this momentum and do the above average growth you guys have been doing?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Emphatically, yes, and it's not just NPI 2.0, but it's something I think we introduced to you and I alluded to today, can't remember when we introduced it, Jeff, but the EGI, Enterprise Growth Initiatives, you can't underestimate that as well. And that's adding one or two points of growth annually for us on top of what we get from NPI. So it's a combination of those two is truly in our DNA and doesn't mean we've become complacent about it, but now we've got to continue to make sure we reinvigorate it, reinvent it, that's why we took a timeout and introduced 2.0, and that's why we introduced EGI maybe three or four years ago is we've always got to challenge ourselves of finding different ways to innovate for our customers.","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And with that success that helps us be confident in the 6% to 8% organic growth model that we continue to focus on.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a lot.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Again, just last one. Is there any update to the TDX UK contract?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I gave a few brief highlights. It's moving along very well. We still have the technical environment. We've cleared almost every operational hurdle that the government has asked for and we expect to go live \u2013 I think our first data feed is this week, next week, and really start going live late third quarter and into early fourth quarter. Really consistent with what we talked about maybe nine months ago, modest revenue in the fourth quarter and ramping up nicely in the first quarter 2016.","Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bill Warmington at Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So for PSOL, what's going on in the affinity business? And that market's been quiet for years, but now it's coming back to life. Why is that and are you guys participating in that?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm looking at it. It's starting to come back. It's a \u2013 we're not as heavily focused in the affinity market as others are. We're heavily focused in the indirect market and I think I alluded to in my earnings notes that that's growing strong double digits for us, but we're not a heavy player in the affinity market.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah? Well then in \u2013 back in April you announced a new version of the FICO score that you see. NCTUE data helped generate a FICO score for consumers that didn't have sufficient data in their credit files to do a traditional FICO score. So how is that pilot going and does it have a chance to become a meaningful contributor to revenue for you some day?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think so. It's early days, but I think any time we can help our customers, be it banks or telcos, get transparency and better insights into the under-banked they win, the under-banked win and we win. I alluded to the fact, in one of the Latin American countries we're building capabilities with an exchange at transparency in that exact segment. There is nothing to do with the FICO score that you're talking about, leveraging on utility database. But it's the same concept, how to get transparency to the under-banked? And I think if we do that smartly, and the FICO score is one way to do that, again that's a win-win-win.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, Rick, you chose to highlight you feel good about 2016. I just wanted to make sure I got the revenue movers, the needles that you could see right now at this point that influence 2016? So what I picked up was your view on the strengthening consumer credit application environment, the UK government contract ramping with in-depth placement and obviously the multiyear pass for Workforce Solutions. Are there any other drivers that you see today that influences your 2016 view?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I'll give you \u2013 so, it's a continuation of all things we do, which is NPI, EGI, LEAN operational excellence of execution, blah, blah, blah. But the macro things, yes. a healing U.S. economy moving us into the sweet spot of consumer credit, and same with the UK, same with Canada, the TDX contract as you alluded to as well, and then EWS continue to go through ACA.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. And if you would just call out a vertical for 2016 that you feel like is strengthening, what vertical do you feel has the ability to break out in 2016?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say that management obviously with the addition of a government contract in UK and I'd say Workforce Analytics clearly will be another big step up. Auto, I think the market in the U.S. auto market will be modestly up versus this year, but I think there's still another year of great growth prospects for us as we continue to mature with our strategy there. So those are a couple.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Operator","Next we'll go to David Togut at Evercore ISI.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. Good morning, Rick and John.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, David.","John W. Gamble - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hello.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","I apologize. I joined the call a few minutes late. But, did you disclose, Rick, the number of active Work Number records?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I did not. I talked \u2013 someone asked the question, David, I can't recall who it was. I apologize for that, but \u2013 about Work Number, and I talked about long-term growth and we have a path and a strategy to get our total records to 300 million, David, maybe about a year or two ago. I've intentionally talked less about the active \u2013 that's growing nicely by the way. It's growing very nicely and on path to do everything we want it to do. But I'm talking more about this path, the 300 million records, because there was a misnomer that I feel maybe eight years ago with EWS in that there was more value or perceived value in active versus total. We derive a lot of value from the historical records as well. So in an attempt to make sure everyone understood that, we're really talking about getting the total database up to 300 million. We're on our way.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And then just shifting gears, you talked about Credit Karma a little bit. What experience have you had in up selling from the indirect channel, higher value-added Equifax services?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Within PSOL or within Credit Karma?","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Well, from the Credit Karma relationship specifically.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Very little.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Is that \u2013 yeah...","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's an opportunity long-term.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Is that difficult to do?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, it just hasn't been a priority yet. It's just getting the relationship understood, stood up and running, but it's something the team can look at long-term.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. And a quick final question. Longer term thoughts on Brazil and how your relationship with Boa Vista will evolve?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good question. Thank you for asking that. Medium term, I know your question was long-term, medium-term, whatever the hell that means, I'm bearish on Brazil. Politically, economically, it's in a down cycle. I'm not sure if that's another two years, three years, but it's tough.","Secondly, there's \u2013 I think everyone knows there was a law passed a couple years ago to include positive data, which we thought was a positive, no pun intended there. There's a cloud over that possibility. It is likely or possible that the positive bureau was in fact controlled and built by the banks, much like Serasa \u2013 if you remember Serasa of old, on the negative data it was built. So I'm not sure strategically what that does to the Brazilian market long-term. So right now, I've always said before I get aggressive in doing this, step up my \u2013 our ownership in Brazil, I've got to really understand what the economy is going to do and how long is it going to be in this downtrodden environment, and where does the positive bureau go. And I think we have clarity on the latter, the positive bureau, probably in the next 12 months, and we'll make a decision at that point in time. In the meantime, they're good partners. TMG is a good partner, Boa Vista is a good partner. We continue to work with them to make sure they are as successful as possible.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Understood. Thank you very much.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brett Huff at Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","You talked a little bit about EGI and I think it's the first time you've called out maybe 1 or 2 points of growth from that. And I was \u2013 it seems like that that was more than in my mind, that that might be contributing. And I guess I have a two-part question. One is, when you're sort of duking it out for wallet share with the other bureaus and the other relevant players, what's helping you win in that relationship? Is it just the long-term relationship? Is it the incremental unique datasets you have, et cetera? And then, number two, what takes that to the next level? Is it just execution and going through just systematically each of your top 50 customers or whatever it is? Or is there another gear in EGI that helps us even accelerate from 1 to 2 points.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brett. I'd say, one, we've got good competitors and I respect our competitors. They do a good job in the marketplace and we got D&B (53:20) or Experian or local competitors in local countries. Two, you can't underestimate the power of having good people and we've been blessed to have some really good, talented, committed people. Then beyond that, I'd say there's no doubt that innovation, be it through EGI or NPI really leveraged by unique data assets has been a huge differentiator over the years. And I tell people that the growth in that area of innovation isn't always or even largely share gain. It is, in some cases, clearly, Brett. But it is solving problems that no one else can solve. So if they used to spend $100 in the ecosystem, if they're now spending $110, we get the incremental $10 spend. That's really where the great leverage is.","And then, the other thing is \u2013 where was I going to go. Cameron (54:20) obviously will be an enabler long-term for us, so beyond that, how do you sustain that? I think it's sustainable mid-term and long-term, as I mentioned to someone else's question earlier. We've got to continue to reinvent ourselves, remain contemporary. I think we've also got to say what is the next asset we need that adds value to our customers that are our competition or the marketplace is not adding today. So in our strategic planning process, we always think about what is next. Obviously, I would not allude to that here, but that's something we think about.","Brett Huff - Stephens, Inc.","Great. That's what I needed. Thanks for your time.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brett.","Operator","And we'll move next to Gary Bisbee at RBC Capital Markets.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, just one quick follow-up. Given the momentum in the ACA compliance offering, do you feel like all companies, or the vast majority of companies, you are trying to get that together this year and then you've got a much tougher comp for that next year? Or is this going to be a multi-year thing where you broaden out the analytics and are able to sell into that customer base?","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, clearly multi-year. I mean, people are going to get \u2013 I can promise you this, the majority of companies, when we talk to CEOs, we've talked to the chief HR officers, they're thinking about this today and they're either looking to us or someone else in the marketplace to solve those problems or they're trying to build their own homegrown solutions, and if they're out of compliance, they're going to get fined. As those fines start to mount their need for solutions go up and the urgency for the solutions go up. Secondly, I alluded, Gary in my comments that the IRS piece of the compliance goes live February of next year, so we haven't even monetized that yet to its fullest extent. So I think if it's a baseball analogy, the Workforce analytics potential is in the very early innings of its growth.","Gary E. Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Richard F. Smith - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn it back over to management for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","I want to thank everybody for their time and their interest and their support of Equifax. And with that, we'll conclude the call.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, Sir.","Jeff Dodge","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations; and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance.","For the first quarter of 2017, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes the acquisition-related amortization expense, the transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda, the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement and adjustments resulting from the conclusion of tax audits.","Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation, amortization and the onetime impact of certain transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Veda.","These non-GAAP financial measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website.","Please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As always, thanks for joining us on this call. Comes off of a really strong start in '17. A solid first quarter performance across every business unit, every vertical in different geographies around the world. Once again, the growth that the team has delivered was very broad-based.","We entered 2017 with great momentum than 2016, which I think you'll agree was a record year on so many fronts, including new product innovation and the international expansion with our acquisition of Veda last year. The management team is building on the momentum from 2016 with each of our business units and COEs executing at a high level.","Total revenue for the quarter was $832 million, up 14% on a reported basis and up 15% on local-currency basis in the first quarter of 2016. For the quarter, FX created $8 million of year-over-year headwind.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36%, up a solid 180 basis points from a year ago, well above the guidance we provided for the quarter and for the year. Adjusted EPS was $1.44, up 17% and now I'll jump into individual BUs as I typically do. I'll start with USIS.","They delivered a solid 5% revenue growth in the quarter driven by mortgage, new product innovation and enterprise growth initiatives. In the quarter, USIS had strong double-digit growth across the mortgage, government and communications verticals and high single-digit growth in several areas, including Prescreen and Identity and Fraud Solutions.","But much of this growth is supported by continued strong growth in our enterprise and alliance channels. USIS delivered this growth in the quarter despite a drag from DTC resettle revenues of 1.4 percentage points. You remember, we've talked about that before. That's a piece of DTC that's not in GCS, it resides in USIS. EBITDA margins remained very strong at 48.6%.","Last several quarters, we've discussed the outstanding progress the teams have made with our Cambrian data and analytics platform and the opportunity to help our customers launch products and solutions with greater speed and insights.","This quarter, we announced Equifax Ignite, a portfolio of data and analytic capabilities and solutions for customers powered by Cambrian, which we've talked about for quite some time.","It is a best-in-class solution that leverages our very unique data assets. Ignite offers our customers a breadth of tailored approach delivered in a very smart and user-friendly manner to fuel our customers' growth with expanded insights.","Our go-to-market portfolio for Ignite includes Cambrian direct, which is direct access to our high-speed analytical environment for a rapid model and score development and Cambrian marketplace, which is a user configurable app that deliver actual insights for easy consumption, typically by a -- the business usual or analyst versus the data scientists, be more likely to use Cambrian Direct.","This comprehensive approach allows us to meet both the needs of the traditional user as well as our customers' analytical experts who will have the ability to combine Equifax data with customer data and third-party data to build custom solutions -- the custom models and solutions to solve problems in a new and innovative ways. While it is early, we see tremendous potential with Ignite, which has the flexibility and analytical tools to meet multiple market needs.","In first quarter, we launched our InstaTouch mobile solution, including -- with a major financial partner. InstaTouch provides a simple way for personal identity information to be securely pre-populated into an application, helping to improve the conversion and reduce fallout -- application fallout, which is typically caused by friction.","We believe this product capability has applications for both customers, as well as Global Consumer Solutions and our other consumers support operations around the globe.","NPI, New Product Innovation, will continue to be a powerful driver for USIS as a future growth. We see great opportunities for USIS\/NPI efforts in 2017 and 2018 in fraud, digital media, mobile and auto. Trended data mortgage was a big driver of NPI and USIS in 2016, and we'll continue to realize benefits in 2017.","We continue to make good progress on our enterprise growth initiative to determine the benefit of trended data as well as our machine learning capabilities. And this focus is across all major verticals, as we've talked about in the past.","We expect to complete this analysis in 2017 and believe it'll be significant opportunities for trended data beyond mortgage in areas such as auto, home equity and card. Although this will drive revenue growth over the longer term, trended data outside of mortgage we're not assuming will be a big driver for NPI revenue in 2017.","An important driver for future growth is our enterprise vertical alliance strategy. Across USIS and Workforce Solutions, we continue to strengthen our sales and marketing efforts, as well as integrated delivery capabilities in our verticals, including mortgage, auto, government and communications. This will further differentiate the competitive advantage of our integrated income, credit and analytics offering.","Our enterprise alliance strategy, which for us includes partnerships with other leading data and analytics companies, as well as other reseller and connected partners, continues to deliver substantial growth.","As we continue to rapidly expand the credit, fraud and income-related data and analytics assets we share with partners, we expect this to be a continuing growth driver throughout 2017 and beyond.","International. International delivered an impressive quarter with strong revenue growth and margin expansion. It delivered 41% local-currency revenue growth. Excluding Veda, growth was 14%. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by an impressive 590 basis points.","International continues to make great progress on their strategic initiatives, leveraging NPI and EGI to drive growth and they also executing Lean initiatives and the regional strategies to drive operational efficiencies. That's really fueling that 590-basis-point margin expansion we just talked about.","It's now just over a year since we closed Veda. In this quarter, we rebranded Veda to Equifax. Integration process has been outstanding, with the team executing at a high level on all the more important initiatives. We're also on track to deploy our global platforms in Australia and New Zealand, including Cambrian and fraud over the next few quarters.","Our management disciplines, such as NPI and Lean, our global technology capabilities are being rapidly adopted and are adding to the strength of a business that was already operating at a very high level. We now have a very strong presence in management infrastructure in that region as we look forward to opportunities for future growth and expansion.","Europe performed really well in the quarter with 15% local currency revenue growth, driven by growth in Spain and our U.K. debt management business. The debt management business in the U.K. continues to be a growth driver and is off to a very strong start in 2017. The U.K. government remains committed to growing the business with us.","We are now working with 8 different government agencies with the addition of the government's child maintenance group. The total debt placed from the program to date is now up to GBP 2.9 billion and our collection performance with analytics continues to be strong.","Latin America had an impressive quarter with 20% local currency revenue growth. We just returned from a trip to Latin America and spent time with our management team there. Our customers, government officials, economists and some of the very top business leaders in the region. There are a number positive trends on the economic front across those regions and within our business.","Governments there are increasingly focused on financial inclusion. Financial institutions are aggressively looking for new customers and are in need of scoring models and unique data to make their decisions.","We continue to expand our technology capabilities in the region, and in 2017 we expect to deploy Cambrian in Argentina. We're optimistic about the economic outlook as well as our performance across the region, particularly in Argentina, Chile and Peru.","Canada had an outstanding quarter, our local currency growth exceeding 10%. The team continues to execute on several key initiatives, including new products, debt management, trended data and Cambrian, which we launched in Canada last quarter.","Workforce Solutions delivered an outstanding performance of 11% revenue growth in the quarter and expansion of EBITDA margins up to 50.2%, up 70 basis points from a year ago. Verifier grew a very strong 16% in the quarter. We saw the highest growth rates in card, consumer finance, government and auto with continued strong growth also in mortgage and preemployment.","In Verification Services, the team created another innovative solution, the consumer employment and income report. This report augments employment and income verification data with credit data from the credit reporting database and other unique data assets to help our clients meet their specific verification needs.","This new report can be tailored to any vertical and\/or specific need of the verifier. This is just one example of how we're leveraging our differentiated data assets across the business and combine them with our technological capabilities to deliver high-value insights and solutions to our customers. That was launched in the second quarter -- or in the first quarter and should be a revenue contribute for us throughout the balance of the year.","In Employer Services this quarter, we launched a fully automated wage audit compliant solution, which relieves the growing burden employers face to fulfill state mandates for wage and employment data used to detect unemployment benefit over payments and fraud.","We continue to help our employers with innovative compliance solutions like this that are contemporary to our existing offerings -- top measures for our existing offerings in unfunded claims and other areas. This also positions us to provide these employers a way to seamlessly contribute their data to the Work Number database.","Workforce Solutions is leading the way for enterprise-wide government vertical. Expanding and growing this vertical is a key enterprise growth initiative. Team has had several wins in the quarter. The pipeline of opportunities is strong, and the results are nicely ahead of our expectations.","We also continue to make good progress towards launching a Verification Services business in Canada, and we're in discussions with several partners that will accelerate the record acquisitions. And to date, the number of records we've had at the data base are nicely ahead of our expectations.","Global Consumer Solutions reported 13% local currency revenue growth and expanded EBITDA margins by 90 basis points in the first quarter. GCS continues to focus on expanding the consumer channels they serve, in addition to continuing to expand our relationship with direct to consumer partners like Credit Karma, LifeLock and ClearScore of U.K. We're also expanding other indirect channels, including expanded solution and offerings in the breach, remediation, tax-return, fraud and broadening white label channels.","Working with our key direct-to-consumer and indirect partners, we continue to expand these relationships into Canada and the U.K. as well as looking at other markets around the world.","As I usually do, before I hand it over to John for the detailed financials, let me make a few comments on a few of our enterprise-wide -- company-wide initiatives. Let me start with enterprise growth initiatives, and again, it's an NPI.","Enterprise growth initiatives are fundamental drivers to our -- both revenue growth and global process and technology transformation across the company. This year, we had 15 EGIs designed to drive revenue growth and create long term value.","Year-to-date, these initiatives are running nicely ahead of last year. We're making very good progress on several EGIs focused on transformation -- transformational initiatives, including global deployment of Cambrian and insights activation through Ignite Direct and Ignite marketplace. We'll talk about that maybe more in the Q&A.","New Product Innovation, or NPI as we call it, continues to be a driver of both near term and longer-term revenue. Through March, revenue from these initiatives is running 20% ahead of expectations. Our vitality Index is up from last year and a number of new products in our pipeline is even greater in 2016 pipeline. And as a reminder, as we've discussed before, 2016 was our strongest NPI class since we launched it back in 2007.","We're driving toward another very strong year in our Lean initiatives, with over 400 initiatives to drive revenue and profit around the world. In the first quarter, our Lean initiatives exceeded the targets by more than 15%, and we expect continued strong execution in 2017 across broad portfolio initiatives. Our customer Lean activities also continue to deliver increased value and strengthen our relationships with our customers around the world.","The innovations that the teams continue to deliver, I believe, are truly market-leading. We hold the most unique data in the industry and add value to our data through our leading-edge analytics and technology. This unparalleled combination provides the knowledge that enables our customers to make even better critical decisions.","To reflect this vision, we recently introduced our new corporate tagline: Powering the world with knowledge. This renews our promise to deliver powerful and actionable insights to our customers throughout the world. Executing on that vision will deliver meaningful results for our customers and our shareholders in the quarters and years to come.","We're off to a strong start this year and continue to have a clear path to deliver on the guidance we provided for 2017. Team is energized about the strategic initiatives we've made around the world in data assets, technology and talent to power that growth.","And with that, let me turn it over to John for the financials and I'll come back with some closing comments on the quarter and some color for the full year.","John Gamble","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I'll generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis.","As Rick discussed, in 1Q '17, we performed ahead of our expectations, putting us nicely on the path for 2017. The mortgage in ACA headwinds we discussed in our February earnings call impacted us, as expected, in USIS and Workforce Solutions.","USIS revenue in 1Q '17 was $310 million, up over 5% when compared to the first quarter of 2016 and consistent with our expectations. Online Information Solutions revenue was $225 million, up 3% when compared to the year-ago period. Online Information Solutions revenue was driven by growth in mortgage, telco, government and fraud.","USIS direct to consumer revenue, principally our revenue with other CRAs, declined in the quarter, negatively impacting 1Q '17 Online Information Solutions and total USIS revenue growth by approximately 1.9 and 1.4 percentage points respectively. Our commercial rich related revenues, which are also included in OIS, were also down in the quarter.","Total mortgage-related revenue for USIS was up 27%. Total mortgage-related revenue for Equifax, including Workforce Solutions mortgage revenue, was up 22%. Mortgage Solutions revenue and USIS was $39 million, up 22% year-to-year.","In 1Q '17, mortgage market volumes were generally in line with our expectations. Our revenue performance was much stronger than the market, reflecting trended data, as well as new products and further market penetration.","In 2Q '17, we expect mortgage market volumes to be down mid-single digits year-to-year. Compared to 1Q '17, this creates a drag on total Equifax 2Q '17 organic growth of over 1%. For all of 2017, we continue to expect mortgage market volumes to be down about 15%, and we expect continued over-performance versus the market.","Financial Marketing Services revenue was $46 million in 1Q '17, up 2%. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was a very strong 48.6%, about flat with last year. For 2Q '17, we expect to see acceleration in USIS total revenue growth rate, despite the expected weaker mortgage market, as other areas within USIS strengthen in 2Q.","For all of 2017, we continue to expect USIS to show revenue growth slightly below their long-term range of 5% to 7%, reflecting the expected 15% decline in overall mortgage market volumes for the full year, as well as approximately 1% of headwind for the full year from our direct-to-consumer revenues. We expect -- we continue to expect USIS to modestly expand EBITDA margins versus 2016 levels for the full year.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $200 million in the quarter, up 11% when compared to 1Q 2016. Verification Services delivered revenue of $115 million, up 16%. Growth was broad-based with double-digit growth across many verticals, including auto, card, consumer finance and government.","Employer Services revenue of $85 million was up 5% from last year. Our on-boarding products grew nicely, along with continued growth in our Workforce Analytics business, which benefited from employers completing tax reporting for 1095s and 1094s earlier than in 2016.","Workforce Solutions growth at 11% was strong in the quarter and consistent with our expectations. Growth was impacted by the headwinds and mortgage and ACA, which we discussed in February.","Compared to overall 2016 growth rates, industry mortgage volumes and the slowdown in ACA revenue account for approximately 2\/3 of the change in growth. The remaining 1\/3 reflects timing in our work opportunity tax credits revenues.","We continue to expect, as we indicated in February, that total ACA-related revenue for 2017 will be about flat versus 2016. ACA-related revenue, as expected, showed growth in 1Q '17 as 2016 tax reporting was completed. ACA-related revenue in 2Q '17 and the remainder of 2017 is expected to decline, reflecting uncertainty regarding the structure of the federal healthcare program going forward.","The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was a very strong 50.2% in 1Q '17, up from 49.5% in 1Q '16. For all of 2017, we expect Workforce Solutions to show revenue growth at or above the high end of their long term 9% to 11% range, despite the expected 15% decline in the overall mortgage market and the uncertainty regarding ACA.","We continue to expect Workforce Solutions to expand EBITDA margins versus 2016 levels for the full year. International revenue was $260 million in 1Q '17, up 37% on a reported basis and up 41% on a local-currency basis. Constant currency growth, excluding Veda, was very strong and above our expectations at 14%.","By region, Europe's revenue was $62 million in 1Q '17, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. As Rick mentioned earlier, the U.K. debt management business continues to be a growth driver, and Spain also delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.","Latin America's revenue was $51 million in 1Q '17, up 20% in U.S. dollars and up 20% local currency. Revenue growth was broad-based with strong double-digit local currency growth in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Central America.","Canada's revenue was $31 million, up 15% U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. This continues the trend of improving growth in Canada, reflecting the strengthening of their NPI funnel.","International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2% in 1Q '17, up from 25.3% a year ago. We saw strong EBITDA margin across Latin America and Europe with Canada continuing to deliver the strongest EBITDA margins in the segment. International is also seeing the benefits of their restructuring programs, which began in 4Q '16 and their ongoing regionalization efforts.","1Q '17 is also benefited by having Veda for the entire quarter. For the remaining quarters of 2017, we continue to expect strong year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion in International, but to a lesser degree than will be realized in the first quarter.","For all of 2017, we expect revenue growth for International to be above their long term 8% to 10% range and above our previous expectations. We also continue to expect EBITDA margins to be nicely above 30% for all of 2017.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue at $106 million was stronger-than-expected in 1Q '17, up 11% on a reported basis and up 13% on a local-currency basis.","Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.7% in 1Q '17. The consumer direct business executed through both equifax.com and our white label properties was slightly weaker than we had expected. We did see growth in our broader indirect channels, which Rick referenced earlier.","Our reseller business delivered revenue growth of over 25%, much stronger than we had expected. As you remember, in 2Q '16, GCS in total showed very strong 22% growth with our indirect and reseller businesses up over 70%, as we added a new partner in 1Q '16.","As we discussed at the time, revenue in 2Q '16 was particularly benefited as this new partner made an initial purchase of a substantial amount of tribe year credit data. In 2017, this purchase occurred in 1Q '17. Although it did not have a substantial impact on income, it did positively impact GCS Q1 revenue by over $5 million or more than 5 percentage points.","Given the timing of this project, our 2Q '17 GCS revenue growth will be negatively impacted. For 2017, we expect GCS revenue to be in their long-term model of 5% to 8% revenue growth. We also expect first half '17 GCS revenue to be at or slightly below the end of the long-term range, with stronger growth in the second half.","First half '17 reflects slightly weaker consumer direct in white label markets, as well as the anniversary of large direct to consumer reseller partner wins in early 2016. Growth accelerates in second half '17 as these partner relationships continue to expand and the indirect channel's growth accelerates.","In the first quarter, general corporate expense was $63 million, excluding integration expenses associated with the deed acquisition general corporate expense was $61 million, up 3% year-to-year and consistent with expectations. For Equifax, adjusted EBITDA margin was 36% in 1Q '17, up a strong 180 basis points from 34.2% in 1Q '16.","As we indicated on our February earnings call, we are excluding from our non-GAAP results the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting our settlement. Our GAAP effective tax rate of 20.6% includes a $14.9 million benefit from the income tax effect of stock awards, as well as the benefit from discrete items principally related to adjustments resulting from the conclusion of tax audits.","Excluding these items, our 1Q '17 effective tax rate would have been approximately 32%. We continue to expect our full year 2017 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be consistent with our February guidance at approximately 32.5%.","In 1Q '17, operating cash flow was $104 million and free cash flow was $53 million, both consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect strong growth in cash flow in 2017, relative to 2016.","As we indicated was our expectation in February, 1Q '17 operating cash flow was down versus 1Q '16, principally reflecting working capital, including the Veda acquisition-related items, which positively impacted 1Q '16 working capital; increased employee variable and other compensation payments in 1Q '17 following our very strong performance in 2016; and changes in other assets, principally tax payments, timing and prepaids related to software investments.","Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $40 million for 2017. We continue to expect capital spending to be approximately 6% of revenue. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion. We continued to reduce our leverage following the Veda acquisition, which is now at 2.26x EBITDA.","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks, John. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be between $857 million and $862 million, reflecting constant currency growth of 7% to 7.5%, partially offset by 1% of FX headwind.","Guidance reflects the shift that John mentioned, of over $5 million in revenues in GCS that we previously expected to hit in the second quarter but delivered in the first quarter, and that negatively impacts the second quarter growth by approximately 0.7% of a percentage point.","Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.55 and $1.58, excluding a dollar -- $0.01 a share of negative FX. This reflects constant currency EPS growth of 10% to 12%.","In the second quarter, our mortgage outlook for the market volumes is down mid-single digits. Compared to the first half of 2016, our outlook reflects first half constant currency revenues up 11% and first half adjusted EPS up 14%, well above our long-term model.","Furthermore, our multi-year growth has been very strong, I think you'll agree, from a perspective compared to the first half of 2014. Our first half of 2017 outlook reflects compounded annual growth for revenues of 12% compound annual growth for adjusted EPS of 18% over that period of time.","On to the full year. Our full year 2017 guidance for Equifax revenue and EPS are solid and are unchanged from our February call. As we discussed on this call, our 2017 revenue expectations for International has increased from our February earnings call. While our expectations for GCS revenue has moderated a bit, but still within their long-term trends.","In total, we continue to expect Equifax revenue for the year to be between $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion, again unchanged from our previous guidance. This reflects constant currency revenue growth of 8% to 9%, partially offset by 1% of FX headwind. Consistent with our February guidance, this assumes total mortgage volumes decline of approximately 15% in the year.","We continue to expect adjusted EPS to be between $5.96 and $6.10, up 8% to 10% slightly -- excluding slightly over $0.02 per share of negative impact from FX. This is also unchanged from our previous guidance. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a healthy 100 basis points for the full year.","So, in summary. For USIS, our outlook is as previously expected and communicated during our February call. We expect that to be slightly below their long-term model of 5% to 7% revenue growth with mortgage headwinds impacting them by approximately 4 points for the year, mostly concentrated in the second half of 2017.","For Workforce Solutions, our outlook is also as previously expected. We expect them to be at or above their long-term model of 9% to 11% revenue growth, again, despite 4 percentage points of mortgage headwind. Again, mostly concentrated in the second half of the year. So, outstanding performance in both those business.","For GCS, we expect them to be within our long-term model we've communicated to you a 5% to 8% for the year. For International, our outlook is better than previously expected and above their long-term model of 8% to 10% growth.","And for Equifax's total, again despite approximately 3 percentage points of mortgage headwinds and some additional headwinds from ACA at the company level, we expect to remain -- we expect that we remain confident in our full year outlook with constant currency revenue growth of 8% to 9% for the year. Hopefully, that's helpful.","With that, operator, we'd like to open up for any questions for John or I.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And we're going to take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. First, just a near-term question. In terms of the guidance you've given, even though there are a bunch of headwinds you called out in USIS, just curious why are there any particular products or pieces that gives you confidence that it still improves in the second half?","Rick Smith","Manav, specific to the USIS business or in general terms?","Manav Patnaik","Well, I guess general as well, but I think USIS to start off with maybe.","Rick Smith","Yes, I'd say USIS is the microcosm of the entire confidence we have for the company, and that is the thing that you know so well that we've been doing now for 10-plus years. It's all the stuff we have in NPI. We've talked about the classifieds last year have been very strong, they're starting to ramp up, in fact the last part's 2017.","In fact, USIS is NPI progress at the end of 2016 and in the starting of 2017 is as strong as it's ever been. So, specific to USIS is what that comp is, but also, they're leveraging the same things everyone else is leveraging, things like EGI.","Over 15 EGIs, USIS participates in those as well. So, there's no magic. But one of the things I love to think about is sitting back here, talking to you guys back in fourth quarter pre-election, we gave a framework for 2017, which was, we thought robust, you thought robust and all of a sudden, the world changed with Trump's election.","And we thought \"My God, the world will change and mortgage rates are going to go up, ACA is going to be repealed.\" And yet, because of the continuity of execution and consistency of our initiatives for the past 10 years, we're able to maintain that guidance this year. So, I'm as confident now and John is as confident now in USIS's ability to deliver those numbers and the company's ability to deliver those numbers, as I've ever been.","Manav Patnaik","So basically, what you're saying is it's just a broad-based NPI through all those, but you have the visibility? Okay. And then just on a bigger picture, clearly, a lot of good things still going on in the company, sounds like we have been getting better.","I'm just thinking more, given you've digested, well, somewhat digested Veda and it's going well, like how should we think about capital return at this point in time to balance between doing the strategic M&A versus picking the buybacks back up?","Rick Smith","We're deleveraging as expected. We're thought to be getting our leverage back around 2.25. We'll be there as we exit the second quarter. At that point, John and I will look at both getting back into share repurchase, as well as getting back in M&A. So, everything is performing on track. In fact, then we'll be levering at slightly faster rates on than maybe what we've anticipated last year.","John Gamble","Absolutely. And we don't feel any constraints with executing M&A. We're continuing to go as fast as we can, and we continue to think we have a nice pipeline, as we look at the rest of this year.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then just last one. The commentary you made, I think you had expected that last quarter as well, in the improvement in Latin America. Can you maybe address your latest news on Brazil?","John Gamble","I was just down there, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, in South America. And what we always do is meet with business leaders and meet with economists. And even though we have a small operation in Brazil, as a country, I still remain concerned about Brazil short term. As you know, they had a significant recession last year.","I think the outlook this year is for modest improvement with positive GDP but very, very modest. So, short term, I'm still bearish on Brazil. I like our partnership in Brazil. We continue to work close with our Brazilian partners, and I don't feel that right now is the time to make a decision to be bigger, stronger, better in Brazil at this juncture.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from George Mihalos from Cowen & Company.","George Mihalos","Great. Good morning, guys and congrats on the nice start to the year. Wanted to start off on the guidance. It looks like, from a revenue perspective, you're talking about a pretty consistent 7 percentage type growth over the remainder of the year.","And I'm just wondering, given that the mortgage comparisons will get tougher in the back half and you've lapped the trended data pricing benefit, what do you expect to sort of perk up to maintain that level of 7% constant currency organic growth?","John Gamble","Great question. As we've talked about -- remember -- if you remember the call in February where there was significant concern at that time because of the mortgage market rates going up and mortgage market declining, ACA being repealed. And we talked then about our confidence levels driven by EGI and NPI, that remains the case today.","I alluded to, in the February call, I think even a couple of times last year, George, that our classified last year was an unbelievable classifieds that will bode well for that year, minus ramp up at the back half of the year. Secondly as I said in my prepared comments, the class of products that we're launching, the pipeline of products in 2017 is as strong as ever.","John Gamble","And if you look at the constant currency growth we're talking about in 2Q '17, if you add back the drag from mortgage, it really looks pretty consistent what we delivered in the first quarter. And then if you take a look at total constant currency growth for the first half, we're looking at 11%, right?","So, I think the performance overall in the first quarter and the second quarter and when you take a look at the entire first half growth at 11%, it looks very, very good.","Rick Smith","Well said.","George Mihalos","Yes, that's great. If I could just sneak in two quick follow-ups. Just John the, within USIS, the financial marketing line, that's been a little bit more volatile the last couple of quarters. It seems to have a really strong quarter, then the growth rate comes in a little bit, a little bit more volatile than what I think we've been used to seeing historically.","Any sort of commentary or insight around that? And then as it relates to the USIS margins, they were pretty much in line with the year ago. We've kind of gotten used to them sort of expanding consistently. Just any color you could provide around that. Thank you.","John Gamble","Sure. Financial marketing line, as you know, that can be a little bit lumpy. We're seeing nice growth in prescreen, and we think that's an area where we're probably going to see good performance throughout the rest of this year. But it will be lumpy as you look through the rest of the year as well.","In terms of USIS margins, we're very happy with our margins. They were basically flat. We're continuing to expect them to go up. The small movements that you see in any given quarter are really just mix related, and sometimes related to the lumpy revenue that we just talked about. But generally speaking, USIS margins have been outstanding and we're expecting very good performance this year.","Rick Smith","George, the model we gave, if I could just add on, is for USIS's margin to be -- EBITDA margins to be in the low 50s over time. That's still the goal and you'll see movement throughout any 1 quarter. As you know, there's just a lot of moving parts and, but they're still well on track to make that mid-50s over time and I -- we expect to -- second quarter 2017 to be better than first quarter 2017.","George Mihalos","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. As you look forward to guidance, Rick, I asked you this question in the last call and there's just some concern in the market that you guys usually have some cushion in your guidance that allows you to kind of have some raises through the year, but there is some concern, given you had to absorb the 300-basis-point headwind from mortgage and a little more from ACA.","I think before, you said it was kind of a balanced view of guidance. Anything to update us on that given that mortgage seems to be a little bit better maybe than we're expecting, at least it was in 1Q? Maybe a little bit more insight into the NPI drivers in the back half of the year? Any sort of updated thoughts on your take on guidance?","Rick Smith","Sure. I, and John and I feel as confident today towards the year outlook and guidance as we were when we gave it to you in February, we take that very seriously. As far as mortgage goes, no, as I said in my prepared comments, the mortgage performance for us came in largely as expected in the first quarter.","The team continues to significantly outperform the market, but the actual revenue drive for mortgage was in line with our expectations.","At this juncture, we continue to stick to our 15% total market down for the year. So, no little change there. So, it's just now a matter of the team continue to what they've done for years, which is execute on NPI, execute on EGI, execute on Lean and deliver those goals. So, I remain very confident.","Brett Huff","That's helpful. And then just my follow-up is, as we look, I know we're not talking about guidance for '18 and that's a long way away, but what are the puts and takes on growth that we should be thinking about as we move into '18?","And, I guess, just thinking out loud, mortgage, as well as maybe the even better '17 class of NPI products that you've been talking about. Maybe TDX gets a little bit better. What kind of the -- what are the pros and the cons we need to think about as we think about '18? I think many investors are thinking about what does that growth look like?","Rick Smith","Yes, Brett, just off the top of my head because you're right, that is a long way away. One thing you have is you got about 5, 6, 7 weeks of Veda this year we didn't have last year, which we'll anniversary that. We have anniversaried that.","That goes away. Mortgage, I got to believe that majority of the mortgage will bottom out this year, maybe some stability next year, that could be a help. Number three, may have improvement with the classifieds. As you know, with the classifieds from '16, we launched extra few years to truly materialize and reach their full inflection points, so that should be a benefit, same with classified '17, so.","I also think that if the economists are right and the parts of the world in which we operate, we just got an economic update the other day, that the economies that are important to us should continue to improve. And if they improve, our business improves.","Brett Huff","Great. That's what I needed. Thanks for your time guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank.","Kevin Damien","Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could just give us a sense. It sounds like trended data in mortgage is the largest opportunity. I'm trying to really frame out what it would be in auto and other areas as you roll that out.","Rick Smith","Yes. Thank you, Kevin. We're optimistic. And we've talked about this now for about a year. I think the industry got a little ahead of itself in the optimism on trended data, before the analytics was completed.","We're largely, as I said in my prepared comments, we'll complete that analysis very, very soon in the U.S. then we'll take it to other parts of the world where we're looking at verticals and the sub-verticals.","So, auto versus prime vs sub-prime card, prime versus sub-prime versus neoprime, home equity so on, and so forth. So, this year, you should think of the revenue as far as the guidance goes, including trended data benefit from mortgage only will be the outer years, will get the lift in other verticals, but we're not prepared to frame that up yet.","Kevin Damien","Got it. Helpful. And then just real quick. If we did get these changes in terms of personal, obviously the corporate will -- is beneficial, but personal income tax rate changes. How does that impact the business, particularly TALX? Does that provide incremental revenue opportunities as we work our way through '17 and into '18, based on just new rates?","Rick Smith","All right, by individual tax reform in the U.S, is that your question, Kevin?","Kevin Damien","Yes, sir.","Rick Smith","In theory, any time that we get more cash in the pockets, they're more likely to spend the cash, to do as to fuel economic growth. So -- and again, as the economy grows, our business grows better.","Kevin Damien","Awesome. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you. Good morning. For my first question, you talked a little bit about the progress of the verification product in Canada. I was just wondering if you can maybe give us an update on -- or a little more detail on potential timing of when that could be up and running. What's left to get it across the finish line? And then maybe, I know it's a little long term, but how that size is versus what you're thinking -- what will you see in the U.S.","Rick Smith","I missed that last part Andre, if you could\u2026","Andre Benjamin","How -- I know it's long term, but how big you think that opportunity could be versus the business in the U.S, given what you've seen about, in that vein.","Rick Smith","Overall, we're thrilled, as you know, with the overall progress in the context with the EWS in it. It's been an unbelievable home run for us. It's hard to believe it's been 10 years now. And the Work Number is one of the, obviously, the gems within that business.","And long term, as you know, it is not just Canada. It's taking you to other developed parts of the world where we have a need. We've got a full-time dedicated team now. We've got dedicated technology platforms, we have strategies beyond Canada.","So, expect to wake up in a few years and see us in far more than just Canada as we talked about Australia and interest goes, U.K. and other places. Specific to Canada it's going well, as I alluded in my prepared comments the contribution of records is exceeding our expectations. I caution everyone to think about that as a multi-year return and not a single return.","And once you get into a country with a platform like that, your ability to add different products, to solve different problems for customers in that arena are expanded. So, the opportunity would be beyond just the Work Number and Verification Services in Canada and other parts will augment it with other products as well. But think of it as a nice way of a multiple years to continue to expand the size, the profitability of EWS.","Andre Benjamin","And then on the opportunities for trended data outside mortgage, we understand you're kind of working through the sizing of that and what customers, ultimately, will want from you. Could you maybe talk a little bit about just based on what you're seeing so far, maybe a handicap, which ones you think are likely to become earlier contributors between all autos, cards and home equity?","Rick Smith","I would think auto will be #1, followed by card and home equity. If I had a handicap, it seems similar order, and that's in the U.S. and we're still doing work outside U.S.","Andre Benjamin","Okay. Thank you.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Tim McHugh","Hey guys. Thank you. Just want to -- I think you mentioned you thought USIS would grow faster in the second quarter than the first, this is some improvement in some parts of the business, besides mortgage, I guess. Can you elaborate on what you see performing better as we move into the second quarter?","Rick Smith","Yes. Tim, I'll start and John can add to it. But anytime you look at it, a particular quarter, particularly BU, you're going to see lumpiness. And that's probably what you've seen in the second quarter versus the first quarter of USIS is probably some contracts, new product innovation and USIS is ramping up.","I talked about InstaTouch that's starting in USIS. Some fraud products that are being launched and will benefit in the second quarter. So, it's a variety of things you'll see in the second quarter that you didn't see in the first quarter. But again, I think the more important thing is to try to get context for the full year.","And we gave guidance for USIS the framework for that back in February, and they're going to be in that range for the full year. So slightly maybe below, actually they're in the range in the first quarter. Will be above that range in the second quarter, but full year, solidly within the range.","John Gamble","And the growth is really across multiple segments, right? If you take a look at USIS, we think, we're going to see expanded growth, generally speaking, across the bulk other segments, other than mortgage, right?","Tim McHugh","Okay. And -- I think you said commercial was down. Is there any change in -- or was that just timing as well for, I guess, for Q1?","Rick Smith","Yes, John did say that in his prepared comments. And Tim, 2 things. Again, any context is important commercial, small as you know is slightly down in the first quarter, but we're making a transition, as you know, from this platform exchange called SPFE to a new exchange called CFN. CFN is starting to ramp up.","That has some impact for SPFE and you won't fully see CFN fully ramped up until later on this year. And as we exit this year and go in 2018. So that's what you're seeing this lumpiness during SPFE and CFN.","John Gamble","The nice thing about CFN at this point is in terms of the creation of the exchange and the contributors it's just gone incredibly well. And we, at this point, have garnered the vast majority of the contributors we hoped to achieve, including Telcos, including other top side of the traditional banking industry. So, we think it's a superior exchange, and we're very happy with the way it's been built.","Rick Smith","Well said.","Tim McHugh","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thanks. Good morning. Rick, could you give us an update on where you stand in Workforce Solutions and in terms of building out the number of work number records? And in connection with that, any insights you have into hit ratio on that business would be appreciated?","Rick Smith","Thanks, David. I am thrilled. I was just out in St. Louis, I think it was last week ,for a review with Murray and his team. And the progress they are making is unbelievable.","On active records, total records, partner relationships was established to solve problems and create a network effect is unbelievable, and I gave you some comments there in -- my comments -- in my prepared comments today, which is now we are linking together the credit, the data in the credit file with The Work Number records to augment and expand our ability to deliver value back to the customer.","So, in the past, I couldn't find someone on The Work Number database. But if I can combine with the credit file, I can enhance that, deliver a yes, move some insight back to the customer, which is proving to be hugely valuable to our customers, which will accelerate growth for us.","We just launched that capability of our product late in the first quarter. So that's a way to think about we augmented credit data with a work number database. It's a way to, as you call it, record, get a hit rate or a yes back to a customer for a higher rate than in the past. So, they are -- they're clicking on all cylinders out there.","David Togut","Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. On mortgage, we appreciate all the helpful detail. With Equifax's total mortgage revenue up 22% in the quarter against the down U.S. mortgage market, why shouldn't we expect this level of sustained out performance to continue and perhaps, your expectations overall, for mortgage to turn out to be too conservative for this year?","Rick Smith","Let me give you some color on that. The mortgage market was as expected in the first quarter. And by the way, when you look at the -- what they call the mortgage banker's index, that's an application look versus the volume look, there's always a lag in application of the volume, we tend to look at volumes.","So, the volume performed about as expected. You are correct we did outperform, but clearly expect us to continue to outperform in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter in '18 as well. However, we do expect the volume activity in mortgage, if this 10-year target's is doing we're talking about do decline, the mid-single digits in the second quarter and strong double-digit in the third and fourth quarter, for a total of 15% for the year.","John Gamble","And keep in mind, right, we get the benefit from trended data pricing in terms of the lift for the first effectively 2.5 quarters of the year because we started shipping trended data in August last year.","Rick Smith","And Dave, one last thing, we're expecting rate increases. We're expecting 10-year treasuries to go up, obviously, between now and year-end. If they don't go up as strong as we expect them to go, yes, you're right, that would be a tailwind for us. If they go up, or higher than we expect, that'll be more headwind, but right now I think we're in a balanced position.","David Togut","What assumption do you have for 10-year treasury yields then, by year-end?","Rick Smith","We're expecting it, and I'm not sure of the exact number, a couple I think two or three rate increases between now and year-end, David. Similar with what we were talking about, yes.","David Togut","Okay. Thank you very much.","Rick Smith","Thank you, David.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Patrick Halfmann","Good morning, everyone. This is Patrick in for Tony. It sounded like growth from the direct-to-consumer business came in maybe a little bit lighter than you'd previously expected. Do you think you're beginning to see an impact from the rapid growth of your indirect channels and partners like Credit Karma?","Rick Smith","No. I think, again, this is lumpy but the thing maybe to frame is this, we gave a multi-year framework a couple of years ago. We have reinforced that framework last year and this year of 5% to 8%, and we do expect direct-to-consumer to be in that 5% to 8% for the year.","Patrick Halfmann","Got it. And then one quick follow-up, if I could. I'm wondering if you've begun to see a discernible change in demand for the employment and income inquiries since The Work Number become integrated into the desktop underwriter system late last year.","Rick Smith","I don't know that. I don't think I have that trend. That's a great question, Patrick. And obviously, if any of you may, I don't have that answer off the top of my head.","Patrick Halfmann","No worries. Thanks Rick.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hey guys. Good morning. I guess given the mortgage in ACA drag this year that you've talked about and what was obviously a benefit from mortgage last year, is it reasonable to say that your underlying organic revenue growth without that is actually accelerating solidly this year? Is that a fair assessment just from all the NPI success?","John Gamble","Can you ask that one more time to make sure we're clear on what you're parsing there?","Gary Bisbee","If we just -- if we backed out, right, the benefit you had last year for mortgage market volumes but also ignored the negative hit this year and, obviously, the fact that Veda helped growth last year, is the underlying growth ex that accelerating? I mean, just given the commentary in NPI in the last 2.5 years, it would suggest that it should be, and I think it is, I just wondered if you'd confirm that?","John Gamble","In terms of the math, right, last year's organic was very high at around 12%. And yes, mortgage was a benefit we also had a really nice benefit from ACA growth last year, right? So, as you do that analysis, you just need to make sure you take both of those things into account and -- to determine where you think that shakes out.","But the growth related to mortgage in ACA were a nice contributor to growth last year, and we're not really going to see either of those this year. So, if you're just backing out mortgage, that maybe a tough comparison.","Rick Smith","So, the only thing with that is backing out mortgage and ACA, you'd expect to see organic constant currency growth rate well above, nicely above the long-term range in this year again.","Gary Bisbee","Yes. Yes. It just seems to me if it was several points benefit last year, several points drag this year. You're actually doing better this year without those cyclical market factors from your organic underlying performance, but that's fine. That's good. I'll move on. On the Ignite product, the product launch, what's the revenue model?","And can you help us understand how that works with customers? Is this more just increasing the stickiness by giving them more functionality in how they're using the product? And over time if they build new models themselves using it, that's an incremental revenue? Or is there actually going to be a charge associated with the two parts of that offering?","Rick Smith","Thanks, Gary. The thing about Ignite and, again, two different buckets. One is direct, one is marketplace, and direct has created this environment, the cloud has our data, their data and these -- the data scientists, more customers can access that, anytime they access it they pay for the data that they're accessing, and also it helps us facilitate the building of new products in the marketplace.","Just think of an app-- like an app on your phone where there are configurable apps that the business community where our customers can download those, use those. So, there's typically -- there are two ways you make money. One is there tends to be, in some cases, a fee for setting up the environment for our customers; number two, is obviously they pay if they access the data.","So financially the model is very much majority of the model, will be very much like you've seen across the rest of the business, which is accessing our unique data assets.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi. Good morning, guys. Rick, your enterprise initiatives seem to be proving out really nicely. Can you sort of characterize the contribution from enterprise spending or enterprise clients in your current revenue composition? What it might tell us about where we are in the credit cycle or if that's even sort of relevant to the growth you've laid out?","Rick Smith","Yes, I think strategically it's relevant. What we're trying to do is combine technically, analytically and data and that our go-to-market strategy across multiple -- be used to solve problems for customers.","So, we get into it. If you could take a piece of our product more likely a USIS product and a EWS product, bundle those product offerings technically and analytically together, delivering a single solution to the customer that no one else can deliver. That enterprise solution is a differentiation versus others in the marketplace, enables us to take share and drive pricing and drive revenue.","So, I don't break it out that way. I just know it's the right thing to do. And we've done the vast majority of the vertical alliance or verticals we've attacked have been driven by USIS. I alluded to in my comments that we still have this government vertical where we had more expertise, bigger channels and pipes through EWS. EWS is now dragging along all of the capabilities we have to solve these problems. So, it's a strategic differentiator is the way to think about it, we don't break out the actual revenue contribution.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. And with regard to auto in particular, what is the risk as you look forward in the back half of '17, maybe '18, if we are indeed at peaks are. What might that mean for revenue growth? Is that a call out, potentially the way mortgage in ACA are?","Rick Smith","No, I don't think so. For a couple of reasons. Not nearly as big, number one. Number two, is our assumption that we peak, so the guidance within the industry. And this is the U.S. The guidance we gave -- the framework we gave last year and the guidance we gave in February and the guidance we're reaffirming today is assuming new sales of vehicles in the U.S. and a peak at 17-something.","I can't remember what the number is, 17-something for the year. I don't expect that to go up at all. You kind of -- that's a new high for us. However, I do expect us to continue to find ways to partner with others that have pipes and relationships with the channel partners we talked about, Andrew, for quite some time, to continue to help us fuel growth.","So, I think in our prepared comments, we talked about auto and EWS was a growth driver for them. I expect that to continue to happen. So, one, you've got to make sure we're putting in context is nowhere near the size of the mortgage for us; two, the result will let it penetrate; three, these channel partners are vital to us and a good source of growth.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. Perfect. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi John, could you just give us the Veda revenues for the first quarter and just give us some sense generally how you expect to do for the year?","John Gamble","Yes. We think for the first quarter, we gave it in the script, right? So those revenues, Asia-Pacific is virtually all Veda revenues. There's almost nothing that was there before. And that the performance of Veda was pretty much as we expected in 2016.","I think we indicated when we acquired them long term, we're expecting them to grow kind of consistent with our growth rates, and we're very, very happy with the way they're performing and we expect them to perform on about that basis, as we look at '17 and beyond.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","Rick Smith","Okay. I want to thank everybody for their time and their interest in Equifax. And with that, operator, we will conclude the call. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you, for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8875":["Equifax Inc.

Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization; the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement; and certain costs related to the cybersecurity incident, including cost to investigate and remediate the cybersecurity incident; legal and professional services; and the contingent liability for cost associated with providing free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection services to consumers.","Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes certain onetime items, including the costs related to the cybersecurity incident. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Paulino.","Paulino Barros","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I and the entire Equifax organization apologize to the individuals whose personal information was stolen as well as to our customers, partners, investors, ministers and other constituents who were disrupted by the cybersecurity incident at Equifax.","Last month, when I was named Interim CEO, I told you we'd act to quickly in our efforts to support consumers in strengthening our security and IT infrastructure. I believe we have made good progress in these areas.","In my remarks today, I will discuss these critical areas of focus as well as provide more detail on the near- and long-term actions we are taking. I will close with comments on where I believe we as a, company and the industry, should be heading. John will walk you through the results of the \u2013 for the third quarter, including the cost of cybersecurity incident as well as provide a view of fourth quarter 2017 expectations.","In terms of the status of our investigation into the cybersecurity incident, the forensic investigation regarding the attacker activity within Equifax environment is complete. And we understand what occurred and the extent of the intrusion. The company as well as the special committee of the Board of Directors continue to investigate all aspects of the incident, and these are important inputs to us change \u2013 for the changes we are making.","Being a trusted steward of the information entrusted to Equifax has long been one of the core principles. We have invested aggressively, particularly over the past 5 years in security and network resilience. Nevertheless, the security incident occurred, and with it, the need for fundamental change. Our near-term focus, as we move through the remainder of this year, is principally in several critical areas. First, improving the support we are providing to all consumers, particularly those impacted by the cybersecurity incident. The free TrustedID Premier service we have offered to all Americans provides a strong suite of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.","Although we certainly accept responsibility for the difficulties related to obtaining this service when it was initially launched on September 8, we believe we have made and will continue to make substantial improvements to the accessibility and performance of this service. To ensure any consumer who wants this service has the ability to enroll. We have extended the enrollment period to the end of January 2018 and also extended a period for which we will offer free credit freezes to the same date.","We have made significant improvements in our application process' performance. And currently, consumers wishing to enroll can in general do so in a matter of minutes. In our call centers, we had over 3,000 agents. And more than five times increase in average wait times have dropped to less than a minute, with many being serviced without waiting. There's two instances of consumers' frustration, circumstances where wait times are too long or issues are not handled quickly or properly. We are working to resolve this as rapidly as we can.","Equifax employees globally understand it's our obligation to provide best possible service to consumers. In U.S., we are making every effort to continue to improve the TrustedID Premier Service. We are also providing similar services to impacted U.K. and Canadian consumers.","Second, ensuring we're taking significant actions to protect the consumer and commercial data that has been entrusted to us around the world. This incident requires a revisit to our entire IT and data security practice, including engaging industry experts to support the effort. After a comprehensive top-down review with Megan and PwC, we have taken immediate steps to improve our data security infrastructure. We are hardening our networks, changing our procedures to require close-looped confirmation when software patches are applied, rolling out new vulnerability scanning tools and processes and increasing accountability mechanisms for our security and IT team members. We have also engaged PwC to assist us with our security program, including strategic remediation and transformation initiative that will help us identify and implement solutions in the future, so to strengthening our long-term data protection and cybersecurity posture.","We're also working to bolster our security culture throughout the entire company. Data security will be a mandatory responsibility for all Equifax employees, whether or not they're members of our security or IT teams. Since taking this position, I have spoken to our employees at multiple town hall meetings about the absolute necessity of solid security practice and the critical importance of protecting consumer information.","I have revised our corporate governance structure so that Equifax's Chief Security Officer reports directly to me, ensuring greater accountability of this critical function. I have created a Chief Transformation Officer position, also reporting to me, who will receive the company's response to the cybersecurity incident and coordinate our efforts to build our new future. This will allow me to have directly insight into every aspect of our remediation and transformation efforts.","Third, we're working with customers, partners and data contributors to help them understand the incident more fully and the actions we have and are taking to improve our IT systems and data security. Equifax's historic success was built on the trust of our customers placed in us to help them solve difficult business problems with unique data and analytical assets. This was, of course, predicated on their trust on our IT and data security capabilities. Over the past 2 months, we have been working closely with customers worldwide to address their questions on the security incident and our IT and data security infrastructure and capabilities. Our goal is to be as transparent as possible, and we'll be continuing offer efforts in this area over the coming weeks.","Our customers are also providing assistance by sharing their views of best practices for our integrated cybersecurity program. We're also working to monitor for the use of stolen personal identifiable information being used for fraudulent transactions. And to date, we do not have any evidence linking fraudulent problem activity to data stolen from Equifax.","Our customers have been generous with their time and willing to work with us. The business units with the most direct impact from the incident were U.S. Information Solutions, the Global Consumer Solutions as well as Workforce Solutions. In USIS, as expected, we saw deferrals of customers' decisions regarding the purchase of new products or discrete products and services in third quarter and fourth quarter to date. Within USIS, Online and Marketing Services, which delivers a large online market data project, bore the brunt of the impact. We have seen little evidence to share shift. And to the extent it was occurred, it has been very limited. We continue to see customers engage in business discussions and have closed some important contract renewals and extensions since the incident was announced.","Similar to USIS, Workforce Solutions is also seeing deferrals of customers' decisions regarding the purchase of discrete products and service impact its revenue from both government and commercial customers. This impact for Workforce Solutions was not meaningful in the third quarter, but is expected to impact revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","GCS revenue was not meaningfully impacted in the quarter. However, the subscriber base was impacted by churn and a substantial reduction in customer additions, as we effectively stopped all the direct-to-consumer advertising and cross-sell activities. As we discuss our fourth quarter outlook, we will see this impact accelerate. John will provide more details on the specific revenue impacts in the third and what we expect for the fourth quarter.","We also continue to work closely with our data consumers, and to date, have not seen \u2013 only very limited have not \u2013 have seen only limited impacts across the U.S. businesses. It's important to remember that none of our credit bureaus or Workforce Solution data assets were impacted by the cybersecurity incident.","Fourth, responding and working with the government and other regulatory bodies as they assess the impact of the incident. We have received requests for information and subpoenas for a number of United States and Federal regulatory agencies and several regulatory agencies outside of U.S. In each case, we are cooperating with agencies to provide the requested information. We are also working proactively to brief the appropriate parties about the progress of our investigation in consumer remediation efforts. We hope to reearn the trust of consumers and the government bodies charged with protecting those consumers.","Clearly, this incident has emphasized the need for Equifax to give consumers the ability to control access to personal credit data. We plan to launch our lock-and-alert service on January 31, 2018, which we will offer to all U.S. consumers for free for life. This service allow consumers to lock and unlock their Equifax credit file directly and quickly from their mobile device or a computer.","Finally, we have committed to working with the entire industry to develop solutions to the growing cybersecurity and data protection challenges. We believe the time is right for an industry-wide solution that provides consumers to substantially improve visibility and control to personal credit data for free for life. We believe this is a turning point for everyone interested in protecting personal data.","Due to the impact of the cybersecurity incident, we have decided that the Equifax senior leadership team, my direct reports and I, will receive no incentive compensation in 2017. In order to accelerate execution of all these key initiatives, I have refocused a substantial portion of the \u2013 our EGI and Lean teams on these key initiatives. In addition to improving execution, it will rapidly expand the understanding of the integrated security framework we are deploying across the organization.","As we focus intensely on these mission-critical actions, we must ensure we do not lose focus on executing our core strategic initiatives, including the critical processes that have driven our success over the past 10 years. John will provide you details on the performance of the business segment this quarter, but I will take you through progress on NPI and a few key new products.","Prior to the cybersecurity incident, Equifax had earned a strong reputation for operational execution. This was delivered through a consistent cadency of well-planned business processes. As I have already stated, we will utilize these processes in our overall governance to ensure it is a strong enabler of the integrated IT and data security strategy being developed. It is important that we get back to executing under this operating cadence as we will ensure the execution of our IT and data security events as well as our long-term growth strategy.","The growth engine will continue to be New Product Innovation. Year-to-date, NPI revenues in our Vitality Index are ahead of our targets and also ahead of 2016 levels. This year, we expect to launch over 7 new products, roughly 30% more than 2016 \u2013 than in 2016. Although we expect the cybersecurity incident to impact the revenue on new products in USIC in the near term, we will continue to focus on maintaining a strong phase of new product launches. Also, we remain bullish on many of the critical new products we have discussed with you this year.","Cambrian in our Ignite portfolio of solutions continued to be differentiators for Equifax. The diversity of our unique data with lending analytics \u2013 leading analytics, including artificial intelligence, provide the capability unmatched in our industry. Ignite Direct allow customer data scientists to work directly with our diverse data assets, including trended data and combining their own data to define new solutions to their business problems. Ignite allow business analysis using predefined configurable to highly customized solutions that again leverage Equifax's broad and unique data assets. We are seeing numerous requests to proof-of-concepts, and early results are well ahead of targets.","We continue to move ahead with developments, deployments of the Cambrian data analytics platforms and the associated portfolio of Ignite solutions powered by the platform across the U.S. and Canada as well as Australia, New Zealand, and by the end of 2018, to Europe, Argentina, Chile and Peru.","We continue to move ahead with our InstaTouch family of mobile solutions. As a reminder, InstaTouch provides a single method to confirm the identity of the user of a mobile device, and then for that user, to use Equifax data assets to securely repopulate information to complete an application or a purchase. This unique offering will be utilized globally as we continue to roll out more solutions to the InstaTouch family. These include InstaTouch ID, a customer acquisition service, which removes friction from the process of applying, ordering and rolling or buying and helps business personalize their consumers' or employees' experience. InstaTouch Pay, a frictionless means of providing e-wallet capabilities. And InstaTouch Offers, which leverage our secure prescreen of loan capability and delivers personalized contextual offers. We've been gaining good traction with InstaTouch. And up and running with several key retailers, we expect InstaTouch to be a strong contributor to NPI over the next 3 years.","An enabler to our integrated IT and data security service as well as our NPI initiatives is a continuing investment and deployment of our global technology platforms such as Cambrian and InterConnect. And we are very excited about the long-term opportunity to leverage successes across our global footprint, including building a Workforce Solutions business in Canada and over time expanding to U.K. and Australia.","Looking at the overall market conditions. In U.S., we expect the overall trend in GDP to remain in the low 2% range in 2017, with slight strengthening in 2018. Consumer credit continues to be relatively healthy. And in terms of growth trends by segment, we continue to expect mortgage to be down double digits year-over-year in the fourth quarter 2017, with refi down significantly. Mortgage and home equity delinquencies continue to decline. In auto, the market is essentially flat, with new car sales down slightly, offset by modest growth in used cars. Bank card originations have slowed this year, following double-digit growth last year. With delinquency rates for auto and car had uptick recently, they remain well below levels seen during the recession. Overall lending continues to be relatively healthy with strong underwriting standards.","Outside the U.S., we expect continued strengthening in the economies in Australia and our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Argentina and Chile. We expect a low single-digit GDP growth in the U.K. to be fairly flat looking forward. In Canada, we expect continued GDP growth over 2%, although some slowing from the 2.5% GDP growth in 2017.","I have every confidence that Equifax will execute the critical delivers I covered today. We'll be a better company tomorrow and into the future, more focused and delivering great services to consumers with leading industry focus in security integrated in every aspect of our business. The foundation of our business is to be based on our dedicated and committed people, our core capabilities, differentiated assets and great processes that allow us to deliver great value for our customers and return to our shareholders, just as we have been doing for the past decade.","With that, let me hand it over to John.","John Gamble","Thank you, Paulino, and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP results for the quarter exclude the onetime costs related to the cybersecurity incident. We will provide details on these costs, so you can consider them in your analysis. Our earnings release this quarter was several weeks after our normal timing to allow us to more fully complete our investigation of the incident and the impact on our results.","Total revenue for the quarter was $835 million, up 4% on a reported basis and up 3% on a local currency basis from Q3 2016. For the quarter, FX was a $3 million benefit. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.4%, up 150 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $1.53, up 6%. In the quarter, we estimate that the cybersecurity incident negatively impacted total company revenue by 1% to 2% of sales, principally in the U.S.","We have not seen a material negative impact on revenues from the increase in consumers freezing or locking their credit file to date. Prior to the September 7 announcement, approximately 0.5% of Equifax credit files were locked or frozen. Since then, we have seen an increase in volume in the number of locks and freezes placed by consumers, and the total files locked or frozen currently represent about 1.5% to 2% of all Equifax credit files. Approximately 15% to 20% are locks, and the rest are state-filed freezes.","In addition, the incentive compensation accrual in 3Q '17 was much lower than anticipated, benefiting earnings by over $0.07 per share. Due to the cybersecurity incident, the senior leadership team will not receive incentive compensation in 2017, and the impact on performance and the net costs related to the incident will reduce incentive attainment.","In 3Q, we incurred a onetime charge related to the cybersecurity incident of $87.5 million. These costs were included in our non-GAAP adjustments. $27.3 million of costs for the \u2013 for third-party services provided principally in the investigation of the cybersecurity incident. These costs were generally for legal, cyber forensic investigations and other professional services. $60.2 million in accrued expenses related to the free TrustedID service we have offered to all U.S. citizens. This represents the lower end of our estimated range of costs for providing this service of $60.2 million to $110 million.","As you know, we offered all U.S. residents TrustedID Premier, a free service, which includes unlimited Equifax credit reports, 3-Bureau credit file monitoring, the ability to lock your Equifax credit report, social security number monitoring and identity theft insurance. Consumers can sign up for this free service until January 31, 2018. Equifax does have insurance to cover costs in connection with the data breach incidents with limits in excess of the current amount of the onetime cost incurred in the third quarter, subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of the policies. We are currently in discussions with our insurers regarding the cybersecurity incident.","As a reminder, as our 4Q '17 filings will be made after the completion of the sign-up period for the free TrustedID service, we should have a good estimate when we release full year results of the cost to be incurred in servicing all consumers.","Now let's look at the results of the business units. USIS revenue in 3Q '17 was $308 million, down 3% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. USIS saw the largest impact from the cybersecurity incident. We estimate the negative impact on USIS revenue was 3% to 4% in the quarter. Online Information Solutions revenue was $221 million, down 4% when compared to the year-ago period. This decline reflects the mortgage market decline and the impact of the cybersecurity incident deferring new business activity. Total mortgage market inquiries weakened again in the third quarter, declining by double digits versus 3Q '16, consistent with our expectations.","Total mortgage-related revenue for USIS was down 3%, and total mortgage-related revenue for Equifax was down 2%. While we lapped the launch of trended data in August, which helped deliver overperformance versus the market in recent quarters, the team continued to deliver revenue performance favorable to overall mortgage market growth in Q3. Equifax outperformed the overall market, reflecting the partial period benefit from trended data as well as continued strong performance in Workforce Solutions. We expect to continue double-digit decline in mortgage market inquiries in the fourth quarter.","Financial Marketing Services revenue was $48 million in 3Q '17, down 1%. Revenues in this segment tend to be project-oriented, and this was the portion of the USIS business most significantly impacted by the cybersecurity incident as transactions expected in the period were delayed into 2018. Excluding the impact of the cybersecurity incident, USIS was slightly weaker than expected, reflecting weaker-than-expected sales in the automotive segment and weakness in commercial. The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was 49.2%, down 140 basis points from the 50.6% in 3Q '16. The lower margins principally reflect the decline in revenue in the quarter.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $186 million in the quarter, up 9% when compared to 3Q 2016. Verification Services revenue was $130 million, up 13% as we continue to increase our penetration in verticals. Employer Services revenue of $57 million was flat versus last year. Excluding Workforce Analytics, Employer Services growth was about 3%, at the low end of our long-term growth expectations, driven by growth in onboarding. Workforce Analytics, our business that helps employers stay in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, was down double digits in Q3 and was weaker than we expected. The lack of clarity around the ACA has made revenues in Workforce Analytics difficult to forecast. Given current trends, we expect WFA to be down again in 4Q '17.","As Paulino indicated, Workforce Solutions in 4Q '17 has seen a revenue impact from the cybersecurity incident, specifically deferrals of customer decisions on purchase of discrete products. Although not meaningful in 3Q, this will actually reduce revenue growth and margin expansion in 4Q. Workforce Solutions' adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.6% in 3Q '16, up 160 basis points from 47% in 3Q '16.","International revenue was $240 million in 3Q '17, up 12% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis. Growth was broad-based, with strong performance across all regions. Europe's revenue was $69 million in 3Q '17, up 11% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currency. U.S. \u2013 Europe had several nice wins in the quarter across multiple verticals, including financial, telco and auto.","Asia Pacific revenue was $81 million, up 10% in U.S. dollars and up 6% in local currency. Latin America's revenue was $55 million in 3Q '17, up 16% in U.S. dollars and up 20% in local currency. The Latin America team continues to deliver very strong, broad-based performance with double-digit local currency growth in multiple geographies, including 2 of our largest, Argentina and Chile. Canada's revenue was $35 million, up 11% in U.S. dollars and up 7% in local currency. The team continued to win new business, including in the auto vertical.","International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.2% in 3Q '17, up from 28.4% a year ago. Canada continues with nice margin performance. All other regions showed nice margin expansion in the quarter. 3Q '17 EBITDA margins were very strong. 4Q '17 EBITDA margins are expected to decline from the level seen in 3Q '17.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue at $101 million in 3Q '17 was flat on a reported basis and on a local currency basis. The cybersecurity incident did not have a meaningful impact on GCS in the quarter. Our consumer direct business in the U.S. saw a limited negative impact due to increased churn as subscriber additions were limited in the quarter. We stopped substantially all consumer direct advertising and sales activities after the cybersecurity incident. The consumer direct business is expected to be negatively impacted by these factors in 4Q '17. This was offset by slightly better-than-expected revenue performance with some partners and resellers. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.9% in 3Q '17. In the third quarter, corporate expense was $135 million. Excluding the cost associated with the cybersecurity incident, general corporate expense was about $47 million.","Our GAAP effective tax rate was 26.1% in the quarter and includes a $4.8 million benefit from the income tax effect of stock awards. Excluding these items, our 3Q '17 effective tax rate would have been approximately 30.6%. As a reminder, our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 3Q '16 was 29.1% due to the benefit of multiple discrete items. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 4Q '17 and for the full year is expected to be about 32%.","In 3Q '17, operating cash flow was $280 million and free cash flow was $222 million, up 14% and 12% for the quarter, respectively. Through September, operating cash flow was $609 million and free cash flow was $451 million, up 12% and 9%, respectively. Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $56 million. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.7 billion, and our leverage was 2.32x EBITDA. On our last call, we had indicated that we would begin repurchasing shares in the third quarter. We repurchased approximately $77 million in shares in 3Q '17. However, given the cybersecurity incident, we have again suspended share repurchase activities. We do not intend to repurchase shares in 4Q '17.","Before I hand it back to Paulino for some closing comments, let me update you on our guidance for 4Q '17. As we look to the \u2013 at the fourth quarter, we expect to incur significant onetime costs related to the cybersecurity incident, including legal and other professional fees related to the continuation of the investigation and reporting of the cybersecurity incident, cost of free services being provided to consumers and significant accelerated spend in IT and security concentrated in 4Q '17 and early 2018. We're excluding these onetime costs, a significant majority of which are third-party costs, including the accelerated spend in IT and security from our 4Q '17 non-GAAP guidance. We expect these costs to be in the range of $60 million to $75 million in 4Q '17, so you can use this number in your planning.","As I referenced earlier, due to the cybersecurity event, Equifax incentive compensation accruals for 2017 reflect no payment of incentive compensation to the senior leadership team. And the net cost of the incident will negatively impact incentive compensation attainment.","With that understanding, here's our guidance for Q4. For 4Q '17, at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $825 million and $835 million, reflecting growth of 3% to 4%, with about a 1% benefit from FX. Mortgage market headwinds impact total revenue by about 2%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.32 and $1.38 with approximately $0.01 of FX benefit. We expect the security incident to negatively impact revenue by 3% to 4%. The largest impacts will be in USIS and GCS, with EWS also impacted, but to a somewhat lesser degree. In USIS, we expect to continue to seek transaction deferrals as we continue to work with customers to complete their reviews following the incident. In GCS, we expect our consumer direct revenue to be negatively impacted by customer churn. EWS is also being impacted by customer deferrals of discrete product and service transactions from both government and commercial services \u2013 customers, sorry.","Looking at the business units. USIS revenue will decline slightly versus 4Q '17, reflecting the mortgage market decline and the impact of the cybersecurity incident. Workforce Solutions' year-over-year growth will decline versus the level achieved in 3Q '17, principally reflecting the impact of cybersecurity incident. GCS revenue will decline mid-single-digit percent. Reflecting the impact of the cybersecurity incident, this revenue decline will also impact GCS margins. International is expected to continue to perform well. However, revenue growth and EBITDA margins will be below the levels achieved in 3Q '17.","Our guidance reflect the decline in EBITDA margins in 4Q '17 versus prior year. GCS EBITDA margins are expected to decline versus 4Q '16, reflecting the decline in consumer direct revenue. USIS EBITDA margins will also be down somewhat versus 4Q '16 due to the impact of both the cybersecurity incident and a weak mortgage market. EWS EBITDA margins are expected to be about flat versus 4Q '17 \u2013 4Q '16. We will provide more information on 2018, including information on the expected increase in IT and security ongoing costs, on our 4Q '17 earnings conference call.","Now let me hand it back to Paulino for some final comments.","Paulino Barros","Thanks, John. I want to reiterate our commitment to the consumer and to our customers and partners. We'll deliver on the commitments we have made to provide greater visibility and control to consumers and for Equifax to become a leader in integrated IT and security areas \u2013 data security areas.","As we deliver this, I strongly believe we will be a stronger company and our culture of innovation and execution will again allow us to deliver differentiated solution to our customers that drove the Equifax business model over the past 10 years. Finally, I want to thank the incredible, resilient employees of Equifax. Their efforts to support consumers, our customers and Equifax in general are greatly appreciated by me, our leadership team and the board.","And with that, operator, we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning gentlemen. Appreciate the color you gave on 4Q '17 and so forth. My first question was just around the network security and the spend that you've accelerated. I was just hoping for 2 things. One was the \u2013 some anecdotal color on how much more you're going to spend on it, maybe some areas you're going to spend on it, just to get some more comfort around another repeat incident basically?","John Gamble","Yes. So in the script, we indicated that in the fourth quarter, we expected about $60 million to $75 million worth of cost just in the fourth quarter alone. And of that amount specific to the security actions that you're talking about, it's probably on the order of 1\/3 of that. And then obviously, there'll also be increased spending as we move into 2018. But the immediate spending is on the order of 1\/3 of that.","Manav Patnaik","And I guess, just the areas, just in terms of what you learn from why this mistake happened, like is it just overall or a particular area that you'll be focusing on?","Paulino Barros","As I mentioned in my top-down review, in my speech here, we have done a comprehensive, top-down review of \u2013 with the help of PwC and we're strengthening \u2013 the approach has been to strengthen the entire operations in this aspect, right, from detection capabilities and processes, the tools, updating the tools and innovating the tools that we have to enhance our detection capabilities. And we will continue and there's more. I think that when we have an event of this nature, we need to make \u2013 we need to stop and make sure that we have \u2013 review the entire process. And we do this in 2 steps. First, we want to make sure that our current capabilities are up to speed and able to respond to these attacks; and second, to design the future stake that we're going to have in the company.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then just one last one from me. You talked about \u2013 you talked a lot about customer deferrals into 2018. Just curious if your thoughts around what customers are telling you in terms of your confidence that they will come back in 2018 and do that business with you?","Paulino Barros","I think that mostly, we didn't lose any contracts that we have today. I have met several customers through this process. And it's definitely an issue that we have \u2013 they have visibility on the road map and our implementation and the things we want to do in the security area. We've been very actually grateful that I have been able to share with their Chief Security Officers some insights on how we should project and design our new systems. We \u2013 what we had in Q3, in the USIS mostly, was some deferral \u2013 new projects that they have with us. They want to make sure that our security systems are in line with their expectations. And we're expecting it. As we demonstrate and share our experiences with them, which is going to happen in the next couple of weeks, they'll be able to understand what we're doing and naturally just will come back into a normal cycle of business.","John Gamble","Bottom line is we continue to work through with the customers. We're hoping to win back their trust and then be able to regain the business that we've indicated has been deferred, and we're still working through that process.","Operator","And your next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen.","Georgios Mihalos","Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the tenor of the conversations with some of your large USIS customers, if that has started to improve a little bit or maybe changed a little bit as you've gone through the quarter? And then also, when the intrusion was first announced, Equifax was adamant that over the long term, realizing that this is off the table near term, but over the long term that the growth algorithm that you had set out, the 6 to 8 on the top line and sort of the low double-digit EPS growth, that, that was still on the table. Do you feel any differently about that now, again looking out over the long term, not for '18?","John Gamble","Yes. So again, if \u2013 and I think Paulino addressed this in his script, right? What we indicated is that we think the basic capability of the company has in terms of focusing on diversity of assets and strength of analytics, the historic ability to deliver value to customers by delivering that analytics. And I think what we indicated is, to the extent we're able to work through this issue and regain the trust of customers and improve the strength of our security systems and our IT systems, then those fundamental capabilities still exist. And if they do, we can continue to deliver that value to customers. If we do that, that was the basis of our business model. In terms of specific numbers, no, we're not in a position to talk about specific numbers about our long-term model, and it wouldn't be appropriate at this point. Right now, the focus is on dealing with the IT and security incident and dealing with consumers as we promised that we would.","Paulino Barros","Just to add a comment on the customer side. We have a range of customers that I talked to, a number of them. Some customers have been very, very endorsing, very supportive, helping us, giving us insights in order to do a very, very level a lot of conversations out there in front of the customers. my direction has been, let's go and make sure that we are in front of the customers and get their input and feedback on how the things proceed going forward. Again, it has been in the fabric and DNA of this company, execution, and we'll continue to do so. We'll continue to expand our data asset. We'll continue to innovate and have added value to our customers. This is not going to go away, and this would be the basics of what we have in our business model.","Georgios Mihalos","Great. I appreciate the color. And just as a quick follow-up, if we look at the Workforce Solutions, the deferrals that you're seeing there, is \u2013 are they skewing more on the government side versus the corporate side? Or would you say that, that's been sort of broad-based?","John Gamble","It's probably more broad-based. If you think about the parts of that business where we do more, call it, discrete activities, it tends to be more on the Employer Services side. But I would say it's more broad-based. It certainly touches government, but also it touches commercial customers.","Georgios Mihalos","Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good morning. From your guidance comments, it sounds like you expect USIS to be down in fourth quarter, but really more from mortgage than from these purchasing delays that you've highlighted as a result of the breach. So I just wanted to make sure that, that's a fair characterization. And so basically, you're saying I think that you can reassure these customers to do new projects with you in the immediate future. And so I wanted to just get a sense of have there been any customers that you've been able to convince so far? And in general, just how long does a typical audit take?","John Gamble","Toni, to your comment, we weren't trying to indicate that it was specific to mortgage and not as much to deferrals, right? Both of those are significant impacts, resulting in the decline in USIS in the fourth quarter. So we're seeing a continuation of what we saw in the third quarter continuing into the fourth quarter in terms of customer deferrals. And then also, obviously, the double-digit decline in mortgage are the 2 largest factors resulting in the decline in USIS.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. And any sense on if there have been customers that you've been able to sort of prove so far that you can satisfy their data requirements?","Paulino Barros","Indeed. We have had renewals. We have new customers, in both EWS and USIS, in that \u2013 but this is a process. This is \u2013 we'll have to regain our credibility and make sure that we will deliver on the execution plans that we have in place.","John Gamble","We indicated that we're seeing deferrals into 2018, because we certainly understand that this process takes time, right, and that \u2013 and we need to work through all of the questions our customers would have and be extremely transparent with them so that they can complete their reviews and move forward. So that's why we indicated you're looking at deferrals into 2018.","Paulino Barros","Correct.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, I understood. And just last for me on the consumer business. Can you give us a number of how many have signed up for the free product and what your expectation would be that, that number reaches? And could you just tell us what the difference is between your paid product and the free product, so basically the ongoing business that you're generating in USIS on the B2C side?","John Gamble","Yes. I think in the 10-Q, we provided information in terms of the range of expenses we expected to incur. And we provided detail around the \u2013 how the estimate was generated. So that's probably the best source for that information. And on the second question, I'm not sure I understood it completely. But if you'd like to understand the differences between the paid product which exists and the free product, that information is also available on the website. To be clear, we're not currently selling the paid product on the website, right? So if we have existing customers that we're continuing to service as best we can and doing our best service for them, but we're currently not advertising, not cross-selling, and you can't purchase that product on the website.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thank you, good morning. Could you provide a little more clarity on why you think the customer deferrals will actually be closed at some point in '18 and you don't think that there are market share losses?","Paulino Barros","Well, I think that the network today is better than was in the beginning of this process, and it'll be better tomorrow as we continue to make improvements and invest, as John suggested, the amount of money, the resources that we're investing in to get it done. We believe that we're starting now. And actually, we start next week, in 10 days, sharing the issues that we have related to this process with the key customers that we have and that they will understand what happened and share the road map that we have to fix this in the short term and the long term. A significant amount of this in the short term has been addressed. And so as long as they understand \u2013 this is a technical conversation. As long as they understand the rationale we have in place, then they have no reasons why not to do so. We understand there's a reputational part of the process as well. We \u2013 this is our job to make sure that they're totally informed about our capabilities and be confident to do business again with us. Of course, it's not going to be done in few quarters, but we are confident that we have the resources in place to make sure that we will inform our customers to be \u2013 it's easy of doing business with us again in the near future.","John Gamble","Also, we characterized these as deferrals, because in some cases, these are solutions which we're uniquely positioned to be able to deliver. In other cases, because the conversations are ongoing and are actually \u2013 it's clear that they are being deferred, decision is being deferred based on the outcome of continuing discussions around security. But certainly, to your point, to the extent something becomes deferred over an extended period of time, it's certainly lost. It's only been 2 months since the cyber event. So the discussions are ongoing. So we were characterizing them as deferred. Obviously, if those deferrals continue, those become cancellations. Or these actions that won't occur, not cancellations. They haven't been signed, sorry.","David Togut","Got it. A quick question on insurance coverage. You indicated your insurance coverage is beyond the amount of cyber spending you've had so far. Can you dimension for us what your insurance coverage might be? And what's your overall level of comfort that the majority of the cyber costs would be covered by insurance as opposed to being more Equifax ultimately?","John Gamble","Yes. So we're not going to specifically disclose the specific amount of the coverage. And in general, we believe that the type of cost that we've incurred related to the cyber event are indeed under the general structure of the policy, and we're currently in discussions with the insurers around completing \u2013 around moving forward with insurance claims. And we would expect to make very good progress in this quarter on that process.","David Togut","Understood. A quick final question from me. You mentioned that your current leverage is only 2.32x, and yet you've halted the share repurchase. So could you flesh out why you've halted the share repurchase? Obviously, the stock is down significantly. Is it more a reflection of uncertain earnings power going forward or you just want to keep headroom for potential legal claims against Equifax?","John Gamble","It's more specifically around the fact that given the cybersecurity event that's ongoing, there's ongoing investigations with the company, as Paulino mentioned in his script, that we just don't think it's appropriate for us to be purchasing shares at this time.","David Togut","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc.","Brett Huff","Good morning and thanks for all the details. My question is a little bit of a follow-up on the security spend. And John, I think you were helpful in saying \u2013 you gave us sort of a range of $60 million to $75 million. And I think you said 1\/3 of that in the 4Q was going to be for security and IT. I believe when Rick testified in front of Congress, he mentioned that over the last 3 years, you all spent maybe $250 million or so on cybersecurity and network. Is that $85 million a year the right base to think about? And then can you \u2013 if that's true, can you tell us how much more you might be spending going forward? We just get a lot of question on what's the ongoing kind of dimension of additional ongoing expense for this, if you could.","John Gamble","Understand it, and I think we'll be able to give you a much better view as to what the ongoing increase in spend will be when we hit our discussion at the end of the fourth quarter. My statements earlier were about 1\/3 of the $60 million to $75 million on security in the fourth quarter. That is specifically incremental spend in the quarter, right? It in no way reflects the normal ongoing spend. So obviously, our spend this year is up dramatically from what it has been in the past. To turn to the dimension side of our spend, I think probably the best thing I can reference is we spend in 2017, prior to the breach occurring, so if you took a look at what our forecast was, what we were budgeting, we would have spent about 12% of IT and security combined on our security specifically. So that's probably the best metric to use.","Brett Huff","Okay. And then you also mentioned that there may be some free monitoring or similar services for folks in the U.K. and Canada. I'm not sure if that's included in the $56 million to $110 million dimensionalized number you gave us from the \u2013 kind of taking them on the balance sheet or running that through the P&L. Is that included or is there more to come from that?","John Gamble","It is included in \u2013 but the U.S. is by far the substantial portion of the cost.","Brett Huff","Great. That\u2019s all I needed, appreciated.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, it's Andrew. I also remember that 12% comment in the hearing, the 12% of your budgeted spend of the IT budget spent on security. Paulino mentioned in the hearing this week that four times more has been spent post-breach. Just help us understand what the four times means?","John Gamble","Yes. so if you think about the total spend, the total amount of spent not only on security, I don't think he said immediately post-breach. But total on security as well as the other costs, for example, that I referenced we would be incurring in the fourth quarters, that's the type of substantial increase we're talking about that's ongoing in terms of investigation into the cybersecurity event as well as remediation, which is all around IT security and IT investigation in general, right? So those total expenses are the expense levels, I believe, were being referenced there.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Deutsche Bank.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify one comment. Have you been able to identify in terms of contain the fraud aspect of the event at that point, or is that still in the process of being identified? I guess, the impact of the breach in terms of specific dollar amount from people's credit being impacted and things like that, or was that still ongoing?","John Gamble","Yes. I think all we said in the script was that in terms of identifying specific instances specifically related to the Equifax data that we haven't identified. We can't say that nothing has occurred, right? That was, I think, all we were attempting to say with that statement.","Kevin McVeigh","Got it. So just at this point, obviously, you haven't seen any direct impact, but that's still ongoing. Is that a fair way to think about it?","John Gamble","All we're indicating is we don't have any direct evidence. But obviously, we can't speak to others may have other evidence that they would consider. We were just indicating based on our checks, what we have seen.","Kevin McVeigh","Understood. That's helpful. And just can you quantify the amount you're insured up until, like is there a certain dollar amount that you're insured up to?","John Gamble","Yes. Again, we're not going to disclose the cap on our insurance.","Kevin McVeigh","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, John, you mentioned in USIS outside of the breach that you thought \u2013 and I think outside of mortgage, too, that you saw a little bit of weakness. Your competitors perhaps haven't been seeing that. Can you just elaborate on trends and whether some of that is vertical market-specific or perhaps clarify what you're seeing outside, to the extent that's possible, outside of any cybersecurity related deferrals?","John Gamble","And again, to your point, right, I have to admit, given the impact of cyber, it is a little more difficult right now to give specific industry data. But I think in the script, we referenced commercial and auto. Auto, we did see some weakness in the third quarter. If you think about where Equifax is strong, we're particularly strong in the Southeast. And some of the weather-related events, we think, impacted us in the quarter, perhaps more than others, but certainly impacted us in the quarter. Some of that will come back in the fourth quarter, but we did see some weakness in auto. Commercial, as you know, we've been transitioning and building our own commercial financial network here over the past year. And versus last year, we have seen some weaker revenue as we transition off of the prior exchange moving to our own exchange. And we've seen some weakness in revenue related to that transition. And I'd say those are 2 areas that are probably specific to Equifax.","Andrew Jeffrey","And then to the extent there's been any sort of authentication friction, I'm thinking about the issuer customers as they work to improve authentication and to ensure authentication, are there any sort of repercussions for Equifax? Are you working with customers to deal with that? How do you think about the consumer credit ecosystem broadly and any implications for Equifax around challenges issuers may face authenticating? I'm thinking about online credit card apps, in particular, for example.","John Gamble","Could you ask your question one more time. I want to make sure we understood it. I'm not completely clear.","Andrew Jeffrey","I'm just wondering to the extent an issuer is losing business \u2013 and again, I'm thinking about credit cards, because there are roadblocks or friction that's being introduced into the process of authenticating an applicant or an application. When you talk to your issuers about that, can you help them remediate? Is that one of the things you think that causes them to defer spending? In other words, any blowback on their consumer credit business, does that affect Equifax one way or another? Is it something that you can proactively address with your customers?","John Gamble","Well, I \u2013 we are certainly discussed with our customers probably around this event. In general, right, around authentication, that is an area we have attempted to be of service to our customers in the past. So we'll continue to have those conversations. But anything specific to this event related to that, I don't really think so. But Paulino may want to address that.","Paulino Barros","Yes, I think that in general terms, the industry is much more sophisticated to use different and diverse data assets to go through the authentication process. So the kind of information that was taken from us and the PII information has had \u2013 is not part of their multifactor authentication process that used to normally bring a customer in. So I think that the industry is way ahead on this process.","John Gamble","So again \u2013 yes. And if your question is, to that effect, the way a customer wants to deal with us can hard press to speak with that. But again, we're focused very much on making sure they understand everything that occurred and what we're doing to try to improve it.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jeffrey Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey Meuler","Yes, thanks. I think you said that you're not seeing any meaningful B2B share shift or elevated contract cancellation rights. Can you just, first, I guess, confirm that, that's true for your most recent data into early November? And then the related question would be, I guess, just sizing up the magnitude of the lost USIS revenue: one, you didn't disclose this until September 7 and there was less than 1-month impact in the quarter. Just trying to understand, in a typical business environment, roughly how much of your revenue is what you would call discrete revenue from projects or implementation or other forms of discrete revenue?","John Gamble","Yes. So we disclosed Marketing Services, and as we indicated, that's where most of the discrete revenue would come from. Oftentimes, the discrete revenue can be more back-end-loaded in a quarter than the other revenue \u2013 online revenue than you would see. So that is why you may have seen a bigger impact in USIS, even though the announcement was made in September. And I'm sorry, what was the first part of your question?","Jeffrey Meuler","Just confirming that you've not seen any meaningful B2B share shift or an elevated contract cancellation rate through the most recent data, I guess, into late October, early November?","John Gamble","Yes. So again, we made some \u2013 we made comments in the script around what we saw in the third quarter, and we haven't extended really beyond that. But as Paulino said, we're continuing to work very closely with customers to try to make sure that they get through their process of understanding what occurred and being able to move forward with us in the way they have in the past. So that \u2013 those processes continue, and we'll update you on how they proceed when we get out in the fourth quarter. We also did give you some view as to what we thought the impact of the event would be in the fourth quarter in terms of our revenue. So that would suggest you look there in terms of what we think the impact may be in the fourth quarter.","Jeffrey Meuler","Okay. And then finally, on The Work Number, any meaningful loss of access to records, or do you expect a record growth to slow meaningfully?","John Gamble","So again, I think we made a comment in the script around working very closely with data contributors. USIS \u2013 sorry, EWS continues to work very closely with data contributors. And as we indicated, it's important to recognize that EWS systems were not impacted by this event.","Jeffrey Meuler","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys, good morning. The first question, I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about what gets put in and not put in this breach a total expense line that you included. And I guess what I'm really getting at, clearly, some of the IT spend is going to be more ongoing in nature at a higher level. I also think one might argue, any spend on developing the new lifetime free lock and unlock capabilities that you're going to be introducing next year, those aren't \u2013 hard to argue those are onetime in nature. And so then I think many investors would argue those should not be added back to adjusted earnings. I appreciate trying to help us understand the magnitude of spend, but how are you going to think about that and handle that disclosure as we move forward throughout this process?","John Gamble","Yes. So we broke it out specifically here, because in the fourth quarter, the vast majority of that $60 million to $75 million is really with third parties and consultants as the investigative and planning process is ramped and accelerated in this process. But going forward, as has been our practice, our ongoing spend in IT and security will absolutely be included in our non-GAAP results as well the cost of delivering any free product or any future developments of that free product, right? So we will actively have in the past, which is to make sure that all of those costs are included in our non-GAAP results. So you may see a little bit of lead into the first quarter of some of the extremely elevated spending that you're seeing in the fourth quarter. But on an ongoing basis, we'll act as we have always, which is to include anything which is part of our ongoing business in our non-GAAP results. Does that help?","Gary Bisbee","Yes, definitely. I appreciate that. And then the follow-up, just in any given year, how much of revenue growth or how much contribution to revenue does new business, bookings, how much has that been? And I guess, what I'm wondering is the 3% to 4% revenue hit that you're guiding to for talking about for Q4, I mean, is that a run rate number if we were to make the dramatic assumption that you have no ability to win new business for several more quarters? Or is 3% to 4% \u2013 could that ramp to a larger revenue hit if the deferrals extend more deeply into 2018?","John Gamble","I think the only thing we've historically disclosed around drivers of revenue growth specifically, I think that are consistent with your question, is around NPI. And we've indicated that our new product innovation process delivers on the order of 300 basis points of growth a year, plus or minus a little bit depending on the year. And so that's probably the only number we've disclosed historically. We've never disclosed percentage of contracts renewed or new in a year. That's not something we've ever disclosed, but we have talked about NPI.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then just one last quick one. Can you give a sense of how much distraction within the organization, outside of the senior executive leadership where we know it's been extraordinary, has \u2013 do you think this is have a meaningful impact several layers down, or have you been able to work hard to keep people generally pushing in the right direction despite all of the headlines?","Paulino Barros","Thank you for the question. This was exactly why we created the Chief Transformation Officer, to make sure that we focus our business people into the business side. And we have someone responsible for the short-term and the long-term initiatives that will be generated by this transformation that we have. And also, given our execution and process streamlining capabilities, we're focusing all this \u2013 most of it \u2013 most of these resources within the transformation area, so the business can continue to run and be aggressive and what they have to do, why we do a transformation and execution plans under a separate organization. Of course, in general, everybody got impacted, because this is very disappointing to us as well. So the \u2013 but the commitment and resilience of our employees has been outstanding in how we want to focus on getting back on the boat and row \u2013 continue to rowing again.","John Gamble","And the focus on security is ongoing, right? We should all understand that, that focus on security is through the entire company. Every person, I speak about my organization as well, right, is ongoing and continuous. So I wouldn't call that distraction. I would call that focus.","Paulino Barros","We'll be part of that going forward.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just want to focus a little bit on the direct-to-consumer business. And Paulino made a comment about ensuring that consumers have access to their credit for life. And I want to understand, is that going to be lock, unlock product? Are you envisioning something more than that in terms of what the others \u2013 the credit monitoring that you're providing that there's going to be some kind of version of that, that would just be out there for consumers in the marketplace? I just want to understand what you're thinking about there.","Paulino Barros","This is exactly what you've understood. The focus is on lock, unlock capability that consumers will have when we launch this service in the end of January.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then when you don't market in this business, what is the typical attrition that we should think about? Because you're not going to have marketed for at least probably 6 months. And I'm not sure if you're planning to see if you're going to start up marketing right away. But as we try to gauge what the impact is to the rest of the business, can you give us just an idea of what attrition is? And frankly also, what does that mean in terms of not putting the expenses into that part of that business?","John Gamble","Yes. So Shlomo, I think all I can point you to is we did give some specific view on where we think GCS revenue will look like in the fourth quarter. And then we will certainly give you more color as we get into next year. It's still a bit early to know, right? it's only been a couple of months. But when we gave you our GCS revenue for the fourth quarter, that decline really is heavily related to the question that you asked, and we gave you our best view as to what we think that impact would probably be.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then if you don't mind, as I shift over just to the cost component, it seems to me like there's product delivery cost and then there's kind of an ongoing IT cost. When you talk about the $56 million to $110 million, is that product cost in terms of requirement to buy information from other bureaus and the like, but there are other IT costs on top of that? Or is this a totally inclusive cost? Or how should I be thinking of that?","John Gamble","Yes. The $56 million to $110 million is almost exclusively external cost. It's really the cost of purchasing services from others that we have to deliver. The \u2013 yes \u2013 and also call center. I'm sorry, so the call center cost is in there, which is internal as well as we use some third parties for call center and then the third-party costs associated with the product that we're delivering to people for free. The internal cost is reflected in our ongoing results.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","Bill Warmington","Good morning, everyone. The \u2013 so on the cybersecurity side, it seems like there are really 2 processes involved. On the \u2013 there are the internal changes that you're making to your own cybersecurity. And then externally, there's an evaluation by your clients on your cybersecurity. And so I wanted to ask, when is your cybersecurity going to be up to code or up to standard, however, you want to define that? And it sounds like based on your comment about going out within the next couple of weeks, you could be there or close or whether that's a fourth quarter phenomenon where you feel like, okay, we're up to standard.","Paulino Barros","No, I think that we have a \u2013 this is a journey here. Given the magnitude of the impact that we have, we're going to have 2 stage, of course. One is to make sure the current systems and capabilities of our security organization and systems will be in place to make sure that we're going to the next stage and then design the future stage that we want to have for the business. This is going to be an ongoing effort. There's opportunity for us to modernize and bring that new technology into place. And this is a phenomenon that the entire industry is going to have, okay? The hacking industry continues to evolve, and we need to be ahead of them, and we'll do so. This is the core of our business. We need to be ahead of that industry.","John Gamble","And we're investing heavily to make sure we \u2013 that our security substantially improves continuously, right? And that's really what we're talking about here. I can't make any comment about your \u2013 the specifics of your first question. But we're investing very heavily to make sure that we're seeing substantial continuous improvement not only today, not only tomorrow, but going forward into the future. So that's progressing and progressing very rapidly and as Paulino has talked about, so our conversations with customers, ensuring they understand where we stand and then what we're doing going forward.","Bill Warmington","Has there been any further progress in identifying whether the hack was done by a foreign state actor? Now Bloomberg had run a story saying that there was evidence of that, but it didn't sound like anything definitive has come out. When is there a pronouncement about that?","Paulino Barros","Yes. What we have \u2013 as I have my testimony declared, there's no \u2013 we have no evidence of any third-party, any nation involved in the process.","Bill Warmington","Got it. And then a couple of housekeeping items. What was mortgage-related revenue and the percentage of third quarter revenue?","John Gamble","I don't have that number at my fingertips, but we'll look it up and we'll give it when the next person asks the question.","Bill Warmington","Okay.","John Gamble","Thanks.","Bill Warmington","Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Hi, thanks, good morning. You're guiding to $60 million to $75 million of breach-related onetime costs in 4Q. Can you help frame how you're thinking about total costs of the breach and how much you're accruing for breach costs beyond the $56 million to $110 million that you outlined that's related to free monitoring costs?","John Gamble","So the accrual, this \u2013 the range of the accrual reflects our current estimate of what we think the total costs will be based on differing assumptions related to the breach. And then for the full year, if you include the $60 million to $75 million, that would give you the total amount of costs that we expect to incur in 2017.","George Tong","Got it. Going back to market share shifts, can you elaborate on how much of the USIS decline was due to the data breach compared to mortgage market decline and if you anticipate customer deferral activity to worsen in 4Q compared to 3Q based on customer conversations since the third quarter?","John Gamble","And so in terms of this split of those 2, pardon me \u2013 so in terms of the split of those 2, we didn't indicate specifically how much was related to the cybersecurity incident and how much related to the mortgage market decline. So we didn't give those specific numbers. And then also if you could ask your question again, just to make sure I understood it.","George Tong","Yes. Whether you expect deferral activity to worsen in 4Q compared to 3Q just based on the customer conversations you've had since the third quarter?","John Gamble","Yes, so going back to a previous question, so the mortgage market revenue \u2013 mortgage revenue was about 19% of the total revenue for the quarter. So sorry for the deferral on that. And in terms of what we're expecting for the cyber incident impact, we indicated that \u2013 what \u2013 we indicated in our script what we expected it to be in the fourth quarter. It's certainly greater than the third quarter, but I think a lot of that's simply because of the increased amount of time that will incur that impact. And so it was only announced in September in the third quarter and therefore saw a more limited impact. So I think we indicated 3% or 4%, and that's consistent with what we expect.","George Tong","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair.","Stephen Sheldon","Good morning. It's Stephen Sheldon on for Tim. Just wanted to ask about the higher non-controlling interest this quarter, I guess. What drove that? And does it imply that you're seeing stronger trends from the U.K. TDK contract?","John Gamble","Some of our non-U. S. businesses have partners. In some cases, in some of our businesses, we have partnerships with financial institutions in the countries in which we operate. And therefore when those businesses do better, the non-controlling interest was out. So that's basically it. So it isn't necessarily specific to the U.K. It's a general statement.","Operator","And I would now like in the call back over to Jeff Dodge for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Dodge","Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their time and interest. And with that, operator, we'll conclude the call. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today's conference.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations, and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2012 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","In order to better understand our operating performance, it's important to remember that there were some unusual or infrequent items in the fourth quarter of 2012: the CSC acquisition fees, a pension settlement and certain unique income tax items, all of which were detailed in our fourth quarter release in February of 2012.","In addition, there were some usual or infrequent items in the fourth quarter of 2013: the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, a restructuring charge to realign our internal resources against our most important strategic opportunities and an impairment of our investment in Boa Vista Servicos, driven by reduced near-term market expectations for credit information services in Brazil and increased investment needed to fully integrate and capitalize on a longer-term opportunity.","We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax, adjusted operating revenue and adjusted operating margin, that will be adjusted for certain items which affect the comparability of the underlying operational performance. Adjusted operating revenue excludes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings. Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the associated tax effects, as well as certain other items.","For 2012, the excluded items are the aforementioned CSC acquisition fees, the pension settlement and certain special income tax items. And then for 2013, excluded items are the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013, the resource realignment charge and the impairment of our investment in Boa Vista. Adjusted operating margin excludes certain items. The items excluded for 2012 are the CSC acquisition fees and the pension settlement, which was a noncash charge. For 2013, adjusted operating margin excludes the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings and the resource realignment charge. These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables included with our earnings release and also posted on our website.","Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab on our website for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff. And thanks to each and every one of you, excuse me, for the flexibility in working with us to move the call at a day we have experienced, as I think you've seen, a pretty severe storm down here. And those of you on the East Coast are experiencing a storm today, so I know it's difficult for you as well. So you're in our thoughts as you get through the storms the next few days.","Jeff's kind of preamble there is obviously longer than normal. It's due to the fact that we've had a number of moving parts in the quarter and it's our desire to give you as much transparency as possible, hence, Jeff's comments. And also what I'm going to do here is before I get into the details of the quarter and the business unit performance, I want to reflect back on the last conversation we had together, which is for the third quarter 2013 call. We talked about the outlook for fourth quarter 2013 and we gave you some insight into our expectations for calendar year 2014.","So if you wind back to our last call, we thought fourth quarter revenue would come in between 6% and 8%. We delivered at 7% reported and 8.4% constant dollar growth. We also said that organic nonmortgage market growth would come in at the upper end of our 6% to 8% targeted range, and we delivered 8.1%. So 2013 very much came in line as we expected.","As I said back on the last call, we talked about 2014, we said mortgage would face strong headwinds in the first half of the year, lessening headwinds in the back half of the year and that seems to be holding up pretty much as we expected, and Lee will give you a lot of texture and color around the mortgage market expectation for the year. For growth, we said expect us in 2014 to deliver organic -- core organic nonmortgage growth in a range of 6% to 8%. We're clearly anticipating being in that range for the year.","During the call, Lee and I will give you greater transparency into the FX impact, which, I think, you've all seen, has had pretty significant volatility, starting back in December and continuing into January. So Lee will help you understand how the FX impact will impact both our revenue growth for the year and our EPS growth, and again, he'll give you more insight into the mortgage market outlook for the year.","So in summary and before I get into the details here, 2013 was a great year. It ended as we expected. And as we sit here now in February 2014, with the exception of FX, it looks very much like the picture we painted for you back during the third quarter call. I hope that helps a bit. And obviously, we have ample time for Q&A once Lee and I go through the details.","I'll now jump into my traditional comments regarding the fourth quarter.","Our fourth quarter performance reflects continued strong execution on our strategic growth initiatives as 4 of our 5 business units met or exceeded the guidance we gave you during the third quarter call.","For the quarter, adjusted total revenue was $571 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2012. More importantly, our core nonmortgage market growth -- organic growth was 8% for the quarter, enabling us to more than offset the mortgage headwinds that increased as expected from the third quarter. The adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up significantly from 25.5% in 2012. Adjusted EPS was $0.91 a share, up 21% from $0.76 a year ago.","Year-to-date, adjusted total revenue was $2.3 billion, up 11%. And adjusted EPS was $3.60, up 24%. A very solid year, indeed.","Lee will shortly give the detailed financials for the quarter. But before that, as I normally do, I'll cover some key business highlights for the year and how we see ourselves positioned for 2014.","Looking back, starting with USCIS. With mortgage headwinds and the integration of its largest acquisition ever, USCIS took on some very big challenges last year and then delivered an impressive performance. As we expected, our core nonmortgage market organic revenue growth accelerated from the third quarter, ending the year at the upper end of the long-term growth target of 5% to 7%. Through verticalizing of the sales organization, USCIS has developed a much deeper understanding of our customers' challenges and new opportunities for growth. Combined with our enterprise sales strategy, we are developing more enduring customer relationships by integrating and cross-selling products from all of our business units.","In 2013, we expanded our key client program from 4 clients to 8 major clients, including 4 large banks, 2 telecoms and 2 large finance companies.","The success of our KCP program is broadening relationships with our largest customers and has elevated our interaction in these institutions to the very senior executive levels. In addition to our more traditional products, we are helping them with leveraging more sophisticated data and analytics to enhance underwriting decisions, mitigating fraud and improving identity management [indiscernible] linking our data with their internal data, regulatory compliance and improving collections effectiveness.","As the economy stabilizes and they turn their focus to growth, and they will do so, we expect even more opportunities to emerge that will further leverage our unique data assets and analytics and technology capabilities.","One of USCIS' most significant accomplishments in 2013 was the seamless integration of the CSC Credit Services asset we acquired in December of 2012. By the end of the year, they achieved all their financial and business objectives. In addition, all the former CSC Credit Service customer accounts have been assigned to the appropriate sales channel to ensure the best service levels for those customers going forward. We talked about that acquisition being a low-risk acquisition, but one we took very seriously, and the team just did a heck of a job in delivering on the integration and financial package last year.","In 2014, we expect USCIS reported revenue growth to be in the 0% to 2% range as we cycle through the mortgage headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year. Their core nonmortgage market organic growth in 2014 is expected to be in the 5% to 7% range, consistent with their long-term growth target we've communicated to you of 5% to 7%.","International. They again had another strong performance in 2013, delivering 11% constant dollar growth, which is at the upper end of our multi-year target range. Throughout the year, they strengthened their market position by continuing to invest in new product innovation and strategic acquisitions. In 2013, 14% of their revenue came from new products launched in the prior 3 years. We call that our Vitality index.","Some highlights for International. With the mobile phone penetration across the globe peaking, our telecom customers face challenges in delivering faster organic revenue growth. Leveraging our vertical expertise in the U.S., we are working with customers to leverage data and analytics to develop high-value propensity models, which can deliver as much as a 30% improvement to their decisioning process for postpaid account origination processes.","In Latin America, approximately 65% of all adults are unbanked. Here, we're leveraging our experience with differentiated data assets to develop tools that will improve financial institutions' underwriting decisions for individuals who have no credit history.","Most recently, we closed 2 very important strategic acquisitions for International, Inffinix in Mexico and the TDX Group, which is headquartered in the U.K. These acquisitions broadened our decisioning and workflow management solutions offerings in collections and enables us to further penetrate existing, as well as new customer relationships in our served markets.","Inffinix, a small company, provides collections workflow software on a licensed basis to companies throughout the Latin American region. The software enables customers' collection staff to efficiently process, manage and track accounts throughout the entire collections process. Today, Inffinix's geographic footprint includes customers in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia and Costa Rica. And our plan is to take this product, which is very well suited for Central and South America, across our entire Latin American footprint in the coming years, providing for additional growth opportunities.","TDX provides data and analytics-based debt management solutions. Essentially, they're the middleman between the institution and the collection agencies determining the optimal placement of accounts to maximize collections on the institutions' delinquent portfolio. With their unique data and analytics, TDX provides critical, high-value solutions to customers, largely in the U.K., Spain and Australia. And again, we plan on not only growing TDX in that footprint, but taking it to countries like Canada and the United States down the road for, again, additional growth opportunities.","Historically, both these companies have experienced double-digit revenue growth and carry EBITDA margins which are comparable to our company average.","You think about it this way as well, we play in the collections area today. These give us 2 great opportunities, TDX like a SaaS model and we said Inffinix has a license model that allow us to service our existing customers and new customers in ways we never could do before. It puts us on a more level playing field with others in the marketplace also.","Over the course of 2014, both these companies will be fully integrated into International's Technology and Analytical Services business.","We also made an acquisition of the #1 credit bureau in Paraguay, giving us a leading, competitive position in another important geography across Latin America. As you may know, we were already in Paraguay. This gives us the ability to combine #1 and #2.","The U.K. and Spain had an outstanding year in face of difficult economic conditions, delivering strong growth and gaining market share by focusing on new products, assessing new data sources and developing new products.","For 2014, we expect International's constant dollar -- constant currency revenue growth, including the TDX and Inffinix acquisitions, to be between 30% and 35% growth over 2013. And Lee will give you more texture around that and the impact on EPS later.","Workforce Solutions delivered one of the most outstanding performances in 2013 and revamped many of the go-to-market strategies and ambitiously entered new markets where we'll leverage their enterprise-selling initiatives with USCIS, energize their organization with talent development and outside hires. They also significantly accelerated their core nonmortgage market organic growth in the third quarter to a very impressive 14% growth in the fourth quarter. As a result, all of our key nonmortgage verticals and Verification Services delivered double-digit growth, driven by market penetration and new products.","Our recently announced Decision 360 Solution to the auto industry is a powerful example of how Workforce Solutions is finding new opportunities for revenue growth by leveraging our data assets and verification resources. Through a single-ordering interface, a dealer can get verification of employment, verification of income, verification of address, verification of rent and verification of auto insurance while the consumer is in the dealership, a really big win for the auto dealers. And these are all delivered via the Internet with a single sign-on.","Combined with our credit reports and scores, this represents one of the newest Decision 360 product offerings and a true disruptor in the marketplace. And historical records in the Work Number are also providing a new opportunity to drive revenue growth. We now have 56 million active employed individuals in our database and over 235 million total records. We now have over 3,100 companies contributing payroll information into our Work Number database. We're very much on target to reach our goal of over 70 million active records in the next few years.","For new product innovation, EWS has implemented triggering services that enable state governments to apply greater fiscal discipline in their administration of various social programs. They can validate and verify someone's level of income, are they employed or not employed, before they provide a social service.","Finding new applications for our unique data demonstrates to our customers the commitment we have to innovation and to delivering high-value solutions that improve their underwriting decisions.","The Employer Services portion of Workforce Solutions also had an outstanding year in 2013. One of the biggest initiatives was the implementation of SIDES, which is the State Information Data Exchange System, along with CaseBuilder, to significantly streamline the unemployment claims management process. Currently, 31 states are on SIDES platform, which standardizes, streamlines and automates their entire unemployment claims process. These 2 technology platforms are expected to contribute to improved operating performance, as well as customer service, market penetration and retention. To be honest, that part of EWS was underinvested. Dan and the team have stepped up the investment. We've gone from a business that was probably lagging to a business that's clearly leading in unemployment claims, which bodes well, short term and long, in the marketplace.","EWS has also implemented a number of Lean initiatives to further streamline their work process, improving the quality of service to our customers, increasing our penetration of customers with employee services solutions, strengthen these relationships and increases their contributions of data through the Work Number database.","Finally, one of the most significant new product launches in 2013 was our Affordable Care Act management platform. Leveraging the analytical expertise we acquired through our eThority acquisition in 2011, this product is helping employers understand the financial impact of and mainly as their ongoing compliance with the Affordable Care Act, truly leading edge in the marketplace. And as importantly, this product has resulted in additional contributions to the data into the Work Number database as we sign new customers seeking to understand and ensure they're compliant. Said another way, one of the ways we can help those clients make sure they're compliant is if they give us their Work Number database, which they're now doing. So we add to the records database and we generate revenue through the analytics to ensure their compliant with the Affordable Care Act.","We began demonstration of this product in December of 2012 with the platform operational by May of 2013. In October of 2013, this product was awarded the HR Tech Top Product of the Year, a great example of our focus and commitment to solving our customers' most critical decision needs and our ability to rapidly deploy these critical solutions.","For 2014, we expect Workforce Solutions revenue growth to be approximately flat to up slightly when compared to 2013, reflecting the strong mortgage headwind we have been expecting, particularly for the first half of the year.","Their core nonmortgage market organic growth in 2014 is expected to be an impressive 8% to 11% growth when compared to their long-term growth target of 7% to 9%.","On to Personal Solutions. Personal Solutions delivered double-digit growth for the year, exceeding the long-term growth target and expanding operating margins by over 100 basis points. Through intense focus on customer retention and lifetime value, we have consistently increased average revenue per subscriber and return on marketing spend. PSol has developed some best-in-class management disciplines, which we're now implementing not only in the U.S., but in Canada, U.K. and we're taking it to Latin America as well.","The acquisition of TrustedID was PSol's first acquisition. It significantly broadens our product line in identity protection market and gives us a technology platform that we can leverage in the delivery of indirect solutions to many of our B2B customers.","While North America Commercial Solutions experienced a market slowdown and project slowdown in the fourth quarter, they delivered solid results in 2013, gaining share in what turned out to be an anemic market growth for small business [indiscernible] and they grew the business at 7% in 2013 in constant dollars.","Let me go back, as I always do, to a few of the corporate highlights and then transition to Lee for the detailed financials.","NPI, new product innovation. We've talked about that for 6, 7 years now. 2013 was a very impressive year. For the year, we launched 47 new products and our NPI revenue was up 18%. More importantly, 4 of our 5 business units exceeded their NPI revenue targets for the year. And during the year, we also launched an initiative to reengineer our process to further institutionalize new learnings and experiences so we can continue to drive growth and strengthen our competitive position through innovation. As you know, when you've had something this long, it's good to take a timeout, reinvigorate it, tweak it, reinvent it if you have to, and that's what we've done. It's probably our second or third time we've done that in the 7 or 8 years we've had NPI.","In 2013, we launched 7 new products under our Decision 360 strategy, and we currently have 16 active new Decision 360 product initiatives across 3 business units that will be launched in 2014. We continue to leverage Lean to improve our operating efficiency, and we're leveraging Lean to speed up time to revenue, further enhancing revenue growth. For example: In Workforce Solutions, we totally reworked the process for loading new clients into the Work Number database. This drove a 68% reduction in the time required, improving our service to customers and accelerating the time to revenue.","We also leveraged our expertise in Lean with our customers to improve or streamline their operations and their interaction with us. These initiatives have significantly enhanced our relationship with our customers and made us a more valued partner for future business success. We see that Lean to the customer is a true differentiator in the marketplace and one that our key customers very much appreciate.","Strategic acquisitions play a critical role in our long-term growth strategy. Since 2012, we made acquisitions in 6 countries, supporting strategic initiatives in 3 of our business units. We've also exercised our call option in Russia, increasing our ownership to 50%, which is the current foreign direct investment allowed by Russian law.","Our strategic acquisitions have been and will continue to be a part of our long-term growth model. Each of our business units is involved in identification, recording and the due diligence activities for all of our acquisitions. Historically, we have not participated in auctions, preferring to nurture these relationships to better understand the opportunities, culture and the integration challenges. For example, TDX is a great example of that. For those that we've already made, we continue to identify new applications that were not even contemplated at the time of the original acquisition. That's important here. As we buy companies, good, solid companies, tuck-in companies, that when we get to know them, we find ways to grow their businesses at ways we had not contemplated within the pro forma. Our pipeline of strategic tuck-in acquisitions continues to be robust, and we expect to continue to see these opportunities where the valuation and strategic fit is optimized. I'll underscore they're tuck-in acquisitions. That is, by and large, our focus.","The leadership team of Equifax has relentlessly focused on both the opportunities and the challenges in 2013. In many respects, and I hope you agree, 2013 was a record year for the company. We delivered strong performance in the face of dramatic slowdown in mortgage originations, penetrating new customers and new markets, closed and integrated new strategic acquisitions and we increased our shareholder value by over $2 billion.","2014 is off to a good start. We've already closed 2 strategic acquisitions in our International and Commercial businesses and launched a major new Decision 360 initiative that we just talked about in the outer sector. We believe our diversified portfolio of businesses, investments, strategic acquisitions and the ability to drive core nonmortgage organic growth through innovation and execution will enable us to continue driving value for our customers and our shareholders.","And with that, Lee, if you could go through the financials.","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis.","As we mentioned at the outset of the call, we had a number of unusual or infrequent items, which impacted both revenue and operating income in the quarter. In order to facilitate your understanding of the operating performance for Equifax and its business units, we have prepared tables attached to the earnings release, which reflect our operating performance, excluding these unusual items.","The non-GAAP reconciliations, which are also attached to the earnings release, provide a detailed reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their respected GAAP measure.","Our fourth quarter performance was solid and very much in line with what we had expected. We have a couple more quarters where the mortgage headwinds will challenge us, but so far, it's playing out pretty much as we'd expected.","Looking at the quarter's results. Compared to the same quarter in 2012 for the fourth quarter of 2013, consolidated revenue of $579 million was up 8% on a reported basis. Adjusted operating revenue, which excludes the impact of the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, was $571 million, up 7% and up 8% on a constant currency basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Operating margin was 26.6%. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes the collection of certain 2012 billings and the resource realignment charge, was 27.4%, up 190 basis points from last year's adjusted operating margin, driven primarily by operating margin expansion, Workforce Solutions and Personal Solutions and lower corporate expenses as a percent of revenue.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.62. Excluding acquisition-related amortization and associated tax effects, the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, the resource realignment charge and the impairment of our investment in Boa Vista, adjusted EPS was $0.91 per share, up 21% when compared to the adjusted EPS of $0.76 in the fourth quarter a year ago.","During the quarter, management of Boa Vista, or BVS, our Brazilian affiliate in which we hold a 15% interest, developed a plan to invest more aggressively in technology platforms and market-facing capabilities to capitalize on the long-term opportunities in Brazil, at the same time, reduced near-term market expectations for credit, and as a result, credit information services. This caused management to take a more cautious view of near-term growth. As a result of these changes in plans and expectations, we wrote down our investment in BVS by $17 million. As a noncash charge related to a nonconsolidated investment, we have excluded this item from our calculation of adjusted earnings per share. We continue, however, to be optimistic about the longer-term prospects for BVS in Brazil.","Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $256 million. Adjusted operating revenue was $248 million, up 12%. The acquisition of CSC, which we call our Central Region, contributed 11% growth. And our core nonmortgage market organic growth, including strategic initiatives, contributed approximately 7% to growth, while the decline in mortgage market volumes subtracted 6% from growth.","Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $170 million, up 12%. Excluding the Central Region, revenue was down 1%, driven by the anticipated slowdown in mortgage activity.","Mortgage Solutions revenue of $24 million was down 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the acquisition of our Central Region, Mortgage Solutions revenue was down 14%, driven by the decline in mortgage activity, partially offset by newer information in analytical products. This compares favorably to the Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which is down 51% in the fourth quarter.","Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $62 million. Adjusted operating revenue, excluding the collection of certain reserved 2012 billings, was $54 million, up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Organic growth was approximately 12%.","The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 41.4%. Adjusted operating margin was 39.7%, down slightly from 39.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding acquisition-related amortization, adjusted margins have expanded nicely.","Our International business unit's revenue was $132 million, up 6% on a reported basis and up 11% on a constant dollar basis. By region, Latin America's revenue was $50 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 18% in local currency, driven by solid double-digit growth in Technology and Analytical Services, as well as Information Solutions and Marketing Services. Europe's revenue was $50 million, up 15% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Good growth in financial institutions, telco, retail, and small and medium enterprise, along with strong double-digit growth in Personal Solutions, all contributed to this strong performance. Canada Consumer information revenue was $32 million, down 5% in U.S. dollars but up 1% in local currency. Strength in Technology and Analytical Services revenue was partially offset by a weaker market for Marketing Services. International's operating margin was 28.6% compared to 29.9% in 2012, continuing in the 28% to 30% range of the last 2 years as we continue to invest in growth and infrastructure.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $112 million for the quarter, flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Verification Services, with revenue of $65 million, was down 7% when compared to the same quarter a year ago. Strong growth in card, government and preemployment partially offset the 32% decline in mortgage-related revenues. Employer Services revenue was $47 million, up 12% compared to last year. The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 28.9% compared to 22.6% in Q4 of 2012, driven by reduced acquisition amortization and improved operating efficiencies.","North America Personal Solutions revenue was $53 million, up 9%. Solid growth in our U.S.-based subscription revenue and in Canada, along with the acquisition of TrustedID, were the drivers of this growth in Personal Solutions. Operating margin was 30.7% compared to 28.2% in the fourth quarter of 2012, largely driven by lower acquisition expense, partially offset by acquisition-related amortization from our acquisition of TrustedID.","North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $27 million, down 3% on a reported basis and down 2% on local currency basis, driven largely by softness in our U.S. risk and marketing data services business segments, more than offsetting growth in Canada. The operating margin was 32.5% compared to 34.4% in the year ago quarter.","For the full year 2013, consolidated revenue of 12 -- $2.3 billion was up 11% on a reported and an unadjusted basis and up 12% on a constant currency basis. The full year operating margin was 26.5%, while adjusted operation -- operating margin was 26.7%, up from 25.3% in 2012, driven by operating margin expansion of Workforce Solutions and Personal Solutions and lower corporate expenses as a percent of revenue.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax is $2.69 compared to $2.18 for 2012. Excluding acquisition-related amortization and associated tax effects, the collection of certain 2012 billings, the resource realignment charge and the impairment of our investment in BVS, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $3.60, up 24% when compared to the adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 in 2012.","Finally, last quarter, we alerted you to a comment letter we received from the SEC regarding our accounting for goodwill and intangibles in the CSC acquisition. During the quarter, we continued communication with the SEC about indefinite-lived intangibles, including those assets associated with prior affiliate acquisitions dating back to 2001 to 2005. However, the issue remains open and we continue to work to understand the SEC's point of view and resolve the matter. Any changes to prior acquisition-related intangibles and associated amortization would be noncash adjustments and would not affect our adjusted earnings per share or cash flow.","Looking forward to 2014, we see a few items that will impact our financial results. As Rick mentioned, we recently completed 3 strategic acquisitions in International, one of which closed in January. These, combined with TrustedID and Personal Solutions and an acquisition in Commercial, will add nicely to our product and geographic ranges and will add 5% to 6% to our revenue growth in 2014. We expect these acquisitions to be non-dilutive in their first year and accretive thereafter. As you all -- second, as you all recognized, we expect the mortgage market to be a meaningful headwind due to the decline in mortgage volume since interest rates increased in mid-2013. We expect mortgage originations to be down between 40% and 50% in the first half of 2014 compared to last year and then down a more modest 10% to 15% in the second half of the year. This is very much in line with our views over the past year.","Finally, as you have probably seen, foreign exchange rates for many foreign countries, including emerging markets, have experienced significant volatility over the past few months. Specifically, foreign exchange rates for a number of countries where we compete have weakened versus the U.S. dollar starting in December and accelerating in January. We generally expect a certain amount of year-to-year change in foreign exchange rates, but these movements have been more significant than changes we have typically seen in the last few years. The 2 markets that will impact us the most are Argentina, whose currency depreciation accelerated in December and then dropped 19% in the month of January from the month-end December, and in Canada where weaker foreign demand for oil and minerals have weakened the Canadian dollar. The impact of these foreign exchange movements are significant for us because these 2 countries are among our largest foreign operations and they have strong leadership positions with above-average margins.","Along with movements in select other currencies, we expect foreign exchange rates in 2014 will negatively impact our reported revenue growth by approximately 2% and will impact our adjusted earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.07 per share more than we had previously expected. Because the impact of those 3 factors, acquisitions, the mortgage market headwind and foreign exchange, is not uniform throughout the year, particularly as regards mortgage, we will provide a more detailed view of 2014 than we have in past years.","For the full year, we continue to expect core organic nonmortgage market growth in our target range of 6% to 8%. Acquisitions should add 5% to 6% growth while mortgage, on average for the year, will reduce growth by about 4%, and foreign exchange will reduce growth by about 2% based on our current expectations. We expect this will result in constant dollar revenue growth approaching 8% to 10% and reported revenue between $2,425,000,000 and $2,475,000,000.","For the first half, core revenue growth will also be 6% to 8% while the mortgage impact will reduce growth by about 6 percentage points, given that higher market decline we expect in the first half versus the second half until we anniversary last year's interest rate increases at midyear.","Acquisitions are expected to add 5 to 6 percentage points of revenue growth and foreign exchange will subtract about 2%, yielding 3% to 5% growth for the first half. In the first quarter, the mortgage impact will be slightly greater, about 7% negative and at the peak impact for the year, while the acquisition benefit will be slightly less, in the range of 4% to 5%, as we will have less than a full quarter of acquisition benefit on 2 of the acquisitions. As a result, we expect reported revenue for the first quarter to be between $575 million and $588 million.","For the second half, again we expect core growth of 6% to 8%, but only 1% to 2% negative impact from mortgage. Acquisitions should add 5% to 6% growth and foreign exchange is expected to subtract 2% from growth, leading to an 8% to 10% total revenue growth for the second half.","With regard to profitability, as I noted earlier, the acquisitions will be non-dilutive in 2014, which means the revenue growth will not contribute appreciably to EPS growth until 2015.","Operating margins will decline slightly due to certain first year integration expense in acquisition and amortization, although operating margins, excluding the acquisitions, will increase, consistent with our long-term operating model.","Our tax rate is also expected to increase from 35.6% in 2013 to between 36% and 37% in 2014.","As a result of these forces, adjusted EPS is expected to grow between 4% and 8% from 2013 to $3.75 to $3.89. Adjusted EPS may be down slightly to flat in the first 2 quarters when the integration expenses and the seasonal pattern of revenue in the acquired businesses will cause the acquisitions to be slightly dilutive. Then up single -- high single digits to mid-teens in the second half as the impact of the mortgage market diminishes and the acquisitions begin adding to earnings per share.","We don't normally look beyond 1 year in our public comments, but it's important for me to put this in context. In 2012, we had a great year, driven by 7% core growth and a strong mortgage market, yielding double-digit revenue growth and 18% growth in adjusted EPS.","In 2013, we had an even better year, driven by another year of 7%-plus core growth and the benefit of the CSC acquisition, yielding 11% revenue growth and 24% growth in adjusted EPS.","In 2014, we expect another year of core growth solidly in our target range. But with the mortgage and foreign exchange headwinds, we expect 2014 to be a little below our long-term target performance. However, our 3-year cumulative performance will be well above our long-term goals.","Importantly, as we look to 2015, our long-term business and financial model is clearly intact. We will continue to target 6% to 8% core growth and have shown the ability to add to that through intelligent strategic acquisitions. Early forecasts for the mortgage markets suggest that mortgage origination activity will return to growth in 2015, adding to our total reported growth.","Our recently completed acquisitions should also become accretive. And if we only pursued a normalized level of acquisition activity during 2014, share repurchase during the year will lead to a decline in shares going in [ph] 2015, adding further to EPS growth.","As you can see, while short-term factors may cause our results to vary from our longer-term targets in individual years, the underlying dynamics of our business and our management's ability to deliver against core growth and margin improvement objectives makes our business an attractive one with continued good prospects.","Let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Lee. And we started 45 minutes ago talking about a number of moving parts and it was our intent to provide you with a new level of transparency and insight to 2013, 2014 and as Lee also gave us, an insight into 2015, so hopefully you felt we met that expectation.","So let me summarize before we go to Q&A. Despite the headwind in 2013, our strategy and execution delivered an impressive broad-based performance, and the business model continues to be sound and the strategy we've been executing against continues to offer attractive growth opportunities. The road map that Lee just gave you details the transitional nature of 2014. We fully expect to exit this year with very good momentum, positioning us for stronger performance as we enter 2015.","Given our outlook for 2014, we have increased our dividend 14% to $1 per share per year. This represents what we expect to be a payout ratio at the upper end of the board's policy, which, if you'll recall, is 25% to 30% of our net income going back in the form of a dividend.","So in summary, for 2014, core organic nonmortgage growth of 6% to 8% remains solid and within the model we've given you over the past few years. The mortgage market performance will be as we anticipated and as we've communicated to you in the past year. Foreign exchange is a headwind this year, but should abate as the world economies stabilize in the future. And we should move up to an 8% to 10% revenue growth range in the back half of 2014. And we should be aided by the mortgage market returning to growth latter part of this year and into 2015.","So with that, operator, we'd like to open it up for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take your first question from George Mihalos from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking to reconcile some items. You called out a 32% decline in mortgage-related revenue for Workforce Solutions. For mortgage-related revenue, Mortgage Solutions was down about 14%. Why wouldn't we see those 2 numbers kind of converge a little bit more? Why is Mortgage Solutions sort of outperforming Workforce there?","Richard F. Smith","I'll jump in, then Lee can give you some details, George. It's a couple things, one is the 1% in USCIS then moved to 14% was for mortgage reported revenue, so it's 1% including CSC. If you exclude CSC, it's the 14% that you alluded to. That's just mortgage reporting that's online. There's other mortgage-related revenue streams that were not captured in the 1% or the 14%, that's number one. Number two, as we always say, there's some timing differences between EWS and USCIS. Number three, we've been at the differentiated products in mortgage longer in USCIS, things like UDM and others, than we have in EWS. So we don't break that detail up. But if you were to normalize it, you'd probably find USCIS total mortgage, when you exclude CSC, is closer to that of what you saw in EWS.","Lee Adrean","Yes, and just, George, I would add that pure tri-merge activity within mortgage services was down in the low to mid-20s. And the difference between that and the 14% organic was some of the newer information analytic-based products that we sell into the mortgage market that are actually still gaining traction and increasing share even in a declining market. So just the pure market activity effects are a lot more similar than the headline numbers would make it appear.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's great color. And then just sort of moving on, if you can sort of update us as to your expectations around the CMS contract for 2014 and maybe how you're thinking about it beyond.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, we're still very optimistic. Long term, this is going to be a great revenue generator for EWS and for Equifax. You've seen and read about all the trials and tribulations that the Affordable Care Act has had in rolling it out. There are a number of things that Dan and his team are trying to do now to help the CMS get to a greater coverage. We call it Tier 2. We continue to get very excited about the analytics that eThority is bringing to the table. So it's not a huge number that we're anticipating in 2014. It'll be bigger than 2013. I'm hopeful, as we exit 2014, this thing starts to click in 2015 and deliver some really, really good revenue for us.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And just the last question for me. I know you called out acquisitions in aggregate, but can you comment a little bit more on the contribution from the TDX acquisition? I know it was $90 million in '13. Is that going to be somewhere around $100 million of revenue contribution for '14?","Lee Adrean","Yes, that's a reasonable estimate.","Operator","We'll take your next question from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first question, what is the magnitude of incremental revenue opportunities specific to some of the new verification products that you rolled out in the auto vertical? And do you have any more products in the works there, or you're pretty much done? Are there some other verticals that you see as low-hanging fruit or good near-term opportunities?","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Andre. Now the verification opportunities in the auto D360 solutions we just launched, you should think of those as being incremental margin, very much like the rest of the work, very, very high margin. And as I alluded to D360 in general terms, I can't remember the number now, but we have double-digit pipeline of D360 that we'll be launching in 2014. So that robustness of NPI -- new revenue from NPI and Verification Services and beyond will continue.","Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the North America Commercial Solutions segment, in terms of the small medium businesses, talk a little bit about what the competitive dynamics you're seeing there, what's your current level of commitment and investment to that segment versus some of the others that you talk a little bit more about and maybe where some of the successes gaining share are versus not.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, good questions. We're as committed to Commercial as we are any other business. We don't talk about it as much because it's a smaller business, Andre, as yet. But we continue to invest. We have mentioned an acquisition, small tuck-in acquisition we just made for Commercial. We invest in platforms, we invest in new products, we invest in people. So it's a market that's always going to be there. It's going to go through cycles like the consumer pieces, but I think it's important for us as a business to continue to build out a sizable successful commercial business to augment what we do on the Consumer side.","Operator","We'll move next to Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question about Brazil. It looks like the charge is about 27% of the book value. It seems pretty significant. Has it been a marked slowdown to start the year in Brazil? Or is it more just about the reorg and the investment opportunity you need or the investment you're making to capture the opportunity there?","Richard F. Smith","Sure, Paul. It's both. The only caveat I'd give to your question was it's not just the recent slowdown. If you look back the last couple years, the GDP has slowed, the use or the demand of credit products has slowed. If you follow experience, historical growth patterns in Brazil, that's a good proxy for what the market sees. We obviously don't disclose that level of detail because we don't consolidate Brazil, but there's no doubt that the U.S. -- or the Brazilian economy has slowed. Secondly, we are investing, as you noted, and we've talked about now for a number of years in 2 -- 3 very important areas. One is integrating the core platforms in which we operate, which is important to do. It simplifies and shortens your time to market for new products. That's a heavier investment than we anticipated early on. We're also investing in positive data capabilities in IT. That's still maybe multiple years away, but it's important we invest now so that when the country embraces positive data, we're in a position to jump on that. And third is we'll continue to invest in sales people, sales processes. I was just down there with Paulino late last year; we are still committed to Brazil. I think it's a place we've got to keep our pulse on and stay actively engaged. I believe in what Boa Vista is doing, combined with TMG and our leadership. So while it was a write-down, a noncash write-down for the fourth quarter, we're still committed short term and long term in Brazil.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I appreciate it. And maybe just a little quick one. Has been an even further slowdown into the first quarter?","Richard F. Smith","I don't have any data on the first quarter this time. I think if you look throughout 2013, you'd see the year continue to slide throughout the year in Brazil.","Operator","Moving on to Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just trying to catch my breath after that. Rick, lots of moving pieces. Can I just have you summarize, if you look at the business from 30,000 feet, when you look to '14 versus, say, where we were a year ago, core business, noise notwithstanding, better, worse, the same as far as the growth and profitability profile of Equifax compared to 12 months ago?","Richard F. Smith","I'd say better for these reasons: So the core business, the core organic nongrowth business, is as solid today as it was a year ago. And I think we'd all agree last year was just a great year, building on a great year in 2012. And 2014 and 2015 will be solid. It is better for this reason. TDX is a strategic acquisition that gives us capabilities that we didn't have before. It will start to monetize, I think, in very meaningful ways at the back end of this year and into 2015. They connect capabilities to new geographies, existing customers in new geographies, I'm very hopeful that, that is going to bode very well for us long term. The other point I'd make is we get smarter and smarter every day in this verticalization and enterprise selling that we're doing through USCIS. Andrew, I know you know this, but we've taken the commercial products, we've taken the verification deployment products, verification income products and all the products we had to bear to our core customers in the U.S. and differentiating our offering from anyone else. So we've been at that a couple of years. Each and every day goes by, that gets better and better.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if TDX is your call-out in terms of incremental excitement in '14, when you look at the core business beyond the acquisitions, what are the things about which you're the most enthusiastic?","Richard F. Smith","I just think the execution the team has delivered now for 4 or 5 years in a row continues to hum, such things like NPI. If the verticalization that we have, if you've seen some of the leases we've had, for example, in auto, that is a true differentiator that no one else has done. We get smarter and smarter. In other words, we get domain expertise in each of these verticals, and that in itself isn't a solution. Anybody could do that. It's taking that vertical expertise with the unique data assets we have to accelerate growth and with that, obviously, the D360 is another thing that really excites me this year.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So auto has been a pretty important share driver for you.","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Lee, just a couple of housekeeping questions, if I may. What do you anticipate the net acquisition-related weighted amortization to be this year?","Lee Adrean","Andrew, I don't have that off the top of my head. I would have -- we'd have get back to you on that.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Suffice to say it's up?","Lee Adrean","It's a significant number, yes.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. And as far as the tax rate is concerned, you called out the FX headwinds. You called out the mortgage headwinds. Do you have a sense of what the higher tax rate is costing you just in terms of reported earnings?","Lee Adrean","Yes, that's actually a couple of cents a share. I mean if you take from 35.6%, call it, to the midpoint of the 36%, 37%, 0.9 point on $500 million to $600 million of pretax, you're talking $0.03, $0.04 a share.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And finally, puts and takes notwithstanding again, and this may be more of a question directionally as we look to '15, is there still some operating leverage left in the business? I mean, I guess I'm thinking more about EBITDA because of all the intangibles amortization now.","Lee Adrean","Yes, it's a great question because it'll get muddied through the acquisitions in 2014, even on the EBITDA line as well, because of some initial expenses we incur as we integrate companies. But both on an operating margin basis, and what I'd call, cash margin, it's not EBITDA margin, but cash margin the way I look at it would be operating profit adding back just the acquisition amortization. Both of those measures will get better on our core business in 2014 if you take out the acquisitions. So the underlying model remains intact. And then as we have some experience with those new businesses, we will expect those partly through expense management, but a lot of it from revenue leverage, given the growth prospects of those businesses, those will start contributing to widening. So yes, I think the margin model is intact.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can I just ask on the margin side, I think you said for the full year, it's going to be flat to slightly down. Are there any specific within the segments that you'd need to call out in terms of any directional moves that will be different than what we've expected in the past?","Richard F. Smith","Let me jump in with a general. We always do give some more color. It's largely being driven by the fact that you've got some acquisitions coming on with increased revenue, and in the first year, not adding a lot of profit. We call that as being nondilutive, so that's putting a little bit of margin pressure. The fundamentals of each of the 5 business units from a margin perspective are largely intact. You have slight movement quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year for each of the business units. But at the company level, most of it's being driven by adding the revenue we're getting from TDX and Inffinix without adding profit to the bottom line. Lee, anyone else you'd add?","Lee Adrean","Yes, Manav, I think the key place you'll see some downward margin movement, and it's because of the acquisitions, is going to be International. That's where the bulk of the acquisitions have occurred. And you'll see that affect International margins by a couple hundred basis points.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just sort of big picture, Rick. I think you mentioned, I guess, it was 47 new products this year. I think in the past, you've been in the mid-60s range, not that, that number sort of means a lot from a year-over-year perspective. But just on your NPI targets, 10% I think was your range. Just your comfort level with all the good work that you've been highlighting. Is that becoming a conservative target? Or do you still stick around in that 10%?","Richard F. Smith","I still think the 10% makes sense. Let me allude -- I'll give you some more color in a second. The 47 I'd mentioned in my opening comments, one of the things we had done is kind of re-energize and we've done this a couple of times now with NPI -- with a focus on NPI. One of the things we decided to do very intentionally in 2013 is focus on a fewer larger products. We've traditionally been in the 65 to 70 products per year, so our goal is to reduce that. We didn't target 47 specifically, but a reduction in larger, more meaningful price, and that's what you saw last year. Revenue was up 18% year-on-year from NPI. So extremely healthy year. And long term, yes, I still see a Vitality Index of 10% is kind of the right range for us. You're going to have ebbs and flows as you sunset large classes 1 year. Maybe the next year you don't have large classes you sunset, so you'll be above the 10%. Yes, I think 6, 7, 8 years into NPI, that 10% number still makes sense.","Lee Adrean","And it becomes 10% of a larger number as you might guess, obviously.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, correct. Fair enough. And then just one last one. I was just wondering on the PSol side, you obviously have some headwinds out there with the data breaches and all those sorts of issues. But I was just curious on is there a potential tailwind now that a lot of these banks are giving the FICO score for free and then you get your free credit report? Does the combination of the 2 maybe have any impact on your underlying PSol business?","Lee Adrean","Yes, Manav, I think that's a great observation. I think the growth -- likely growth expectation for PSol probably is moderating, which helps us a little bit as you see more breaches out there. But you're right, the banks -- number one, the banks are under some pressure relative to the way they sell add-on products to their customers as a result of the way the regulators view any kind of cross-selling activities. And you're seeing an increased presence in the marketplace of some free models, which are based on lead generation for other products. So I think you might see a little bit more moderate growth in our PSol business over the coming year.","Richard F. Smith","The flip side, Manav, which you don't really have the benefit of seeing, but we do, is the PSol business is gaining traction, accelerating at a faster growth rate outside the U.S. So the things that we're doing, taking PSol and all the great tools and capabilities that Trey has built again to Canada, U.K., now Latin America helps. And we're at the early days of really understanding what we can do and how far we can take TrustedID with a lot of capabilities for our partners, which as you know, is new to us as well.","Operator","We'll hear next from David Togut from Evercore.","Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Mike Landau in for David. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape that TDX would participate in when you bring the product to North America and maybe quantify the opportunity in that region?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, Mike, you should know this, that one, we did a very -- one, let me back up. My comments kind of alluded to this. We had been working with TDX for about 2 years just really to get to know their culture, their people, their management, their pipeline, their capabilities. We did very thorough studies, brought consultants in to help us understand their uniqueness versus competition in the current footprint in U.K., Spain and Australia, as well as their uniqueness in countries where they were not, places like Canada and U.S. is 2 obvious ones. The second point I'll make there on TDX is we did not contemplate any acquisition or justification of the purchase price TDX coming to the U.S. or Canada at this juncture. There's enough growth short term in the next couple years to grow nicely in the current footprint. We will very systematically think through the launch plan. In fact, I've chartered Paulino and Rudy Ploder with putting that launch plan in place by the end of this year so we can really understand all the nuances of who's in the U.S., who's in Canada and how you systematically make this thing work in those 2 countries, but the business has to stand on its own merits in the current geographical footprint.","Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Great. And then I know you had a quick comment on acquisition-related amortization expense. Would you have an idea of the impact of just TDX to that number?","Lee Adrean","Yes. I'm sorry, I do not have that with me.","Operator","Moving on to Jeff Meuler from Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Actually a follow-up on the NPI and Vitality Index. Rick, should we think about -- looking back over the last couple of years, is this -- is the Vitality Index kind of the accumulation of a lot of singles and doubles? Or are there any triples and home runs that you guys have hit that you can discuss?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it's great. I kind of think about home runs as transformational from a revenue respective. If that's how you define it, which is how I do define it, those are few and far between. I think I've got a lot more singles and a lot more doubles financially. However, what you can find is there are some things that disrupt the marketplace that, over time, will allow you to get additional revenue streams from add-on products, if you will. So trying to chase the home runs, I think, is a bit of a gamble. That's why you see us in the range of 47 products last year up to, I think our high ever was maybe 70-something. If there were home runs, you'd find these being in 5, 10, 15 kind of products. So that's a big risk.","Michael Landau - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the Key Client Program, it seems like you continue to add clients 1, 2 at a time. It's still a relatively small number. It seems like it's going well. I guess just why not roll it out faster? Is it just that you need to add headcount to that organization? Or is it that there's only, call it, 10 to 20 potential accounts that could get slotted into there?","Richard F. Smith","Good question, probably requires some clarification. Think about KCP under the same banner as verticalization. It is no different. So I go back I think it was 2007 or so in the recession, we were looking at the banking sector and said, \"What might the banking sector look like postrecession versus pre, the emergence of 4 very large powerful banks seemed inevitable. I wasn't confident in our positioning with all 4 of those banks at that time, so we created KCP at that time. We then added on larger, more strategic accounts, 2 examples I just talked about, that is now 8. But beyond the KCP accounts, we've got vertical focus now in mortgage. We've got vertical focus in auto, we have vertical focus in telco, probably missing a few more as well. Retail banking. So verticalization, in total, of which KCP is one element, has really transformed our go-to-market approach over the past 6 years. And KCP is one piece of that, and that's working very well.","Lee Adrean","By the way, if I can tag a completely unrelated comment on to that. I've had -- we've had 2 questions about acquisition-related amortization. I've been shuffling through my papers here, and I would tell you that the acquisition -- in total, acquisition-related amortization looks like we'll be up around $15 million to $18 million year-over-year. Again, the biggest impact will be in our International business. That $15 million to $18 million is actually a net number because we'll be down some and we'll see some benefit in Workforce Solutions as we complete the amortization of certain assets from prior deals, but the net for the company will be up $15 million to $18 million.","Operator","We'll move on to Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to focus a little bit more about the demand in the core markets. You're seeing Consumer Financial Marketing has had very good growth for the last 3 quarters. Is this -- are you guys working out kind of the concerns that the banks had in terms of using the IXI data? Or is it really that you're seeing good pickup in the core kind of marketing for -- to consumers within various aspects of the business that's much more related to what I would say kind of the core business?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I think it's a combination of both, Shlomo. We have new leadership in IXI. That, combined with our legal team really working with customers, understand what the regulation really means, it doesn't mean it has helped. You're also seeing the prescreen business continue to increase. That entire Bancard business is up 8% to 10% per year, which is low, so well below the prerecession highs of pre-2009. But yes, we're clearly getting market base momentum, market share gains and improvement in IXI.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So if I wanted to isolate the market share gains that you guys are doing over there, would you say that we're starting to see the banks, excluding the auto that everybody's talked about, just on the credit card thing, are they loosening up the credit standards? Or is it a matter that you guys are able to go ahead and help them dice the market better because of your analytics and unique data, and therefore, you're getting better growth there?","Richard F. Smith","It's a combination of both. For example, there's no doubt that the banks are getting a little more aggressive in their lending standards. For example, if they're going to be more aggressive in auto, go down the store chain, they're requiring a larger down payment or deposit upfront. So they're all looking for ways to grow in a reasonable risk base, and our ability to help them make those decisions with our Decision 360 helps us differentiate and gain share.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just in commercial, can you just give us a little bit more detail? You had 3 really solid quarters and then a quarter where things dropped down. I know that things kind of bump around. Is it really project-related revenue timing? Or is there anything changing underlying in that market?","Richard F. Smith","It's -- I don't think there's any underlying. It's so small, and this is not in a derogatory sense. It's a small business, Shlomo, so going from -- I don't have the math in front of me -- going from, I think, it was negative 3% in the fourth quarter, deposit at 10%. It is a small swing in total dollars. So you could have nuances and movement quarter-to-quarter. I pay more attention to the long-term trajectory of the business and I still remain committed that, that is a growth business for us and it did grow 7%, yes, in 2013.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then in light of what you're seeing in PSol, can you give us more long-term expectations? Have you -- the revision that you guys have in your own mind in terms of what to expect of growth over there over the multiple years.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I can't remember the growth model we provided for PSol long term.","Lee Adrean","Upper single digits.","Richard F. Smith","Long term with a margin profile of x?","Lee Adrean","The margin profile, mid to upper 20s.","Richard F. Smith","So I think, Shlomo, that long-term model still exists. Even though there may be some pressure and you've seen PSol growing at the upper end outside that range for a number of quarters, if not years, you're seeing some moderate slowdown and we expect that to continue. The regulatory environment is unknown. So our challenge is to find ways to continue to innovate, take trusted ideas in levels. And I still think we're in that long-term model we told you guys a number of years ago, upper single digits in the margin profile that we talked about.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. There's really -- it's just a bit of coming from maybe above that range to just within that range. That's all we're talking about here?","Richard F. Smith","That's a great way to think about it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So Rick, I had a question for you. You've thrown out the Vitality Index being 14% of revenue for International. Did you give that also for the company as a whole?","Richard F. Smith","I did not. I think what I talked about was the entire revenue was up about 18% year-on-year. I think the Vitality index is around 9%, if I remember right, Bill.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, about 9%, currently, okay.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, for 2013.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then, Lee, the CSC had provided some pretty healthy revenue and margin benefits in 2013. Can it continue to help performance in 2014? Is there more juice in the lemon, so to speak?","Lee Adrean","Well, I think that we've captured most of the margin benefit, the first quarter will still be advantageous year-over-year because we had some initial expenses in integrating CSC in the first quarter last year. The -- now I think we're into the steady process within USCIS of driving a little bit of growth every quarter and getting them to perform fully at the levels that we think is possible. That's much more of a steady year-by-year effort.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then I wanted to ask about the collections market today in terms of what's the opportunity there for Equifax. It's a place where you've been making investments, Inffinix, TDX. I've always thought of it as being a fairly mature market. I mean, some people call it the second oldest profession, so...","Richard F. Smith","That's good, Bill. Think about it this way. It's servicing our -- one, we're in collections today, and I think you know that we do collections in many geographies around the world. It's an important offering we must have for our customers; two, think about TDX is kind of a SaaS model, which is really our sweet spot, that's what we do. Think about it as Analytics and Technology platforms as right what we do today. So they are a very, very powerful player in the U.K., having great early successes in places like Spain. So I am confident we can bring that capability with our bigger pipes. We've got far bigger distribution network than they do, growing their capabilities for our current customers and new customers in a model that's very financially friendly to us, SaaS model. And think about Inffinix as a little different. If you know our vernacular, you find TDX more akin to InterConnect. It's sophisticated, it's upper end in its capabilities. That's TDX. If you think of a decisioning platform we have across Central and South America, Experto, it really fits those market needs. Inffinix is more like an Experto for us, so it's the same concept there. They're good really in Mexico plus a few other countries. We've got the largest footprint in Central and South America. We can bring their product through our pipeline to our customers and add value.","William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And now last question was, helping banks comply with regulation as a revenue driver, getting better, weaker, flat?","Richard F. Smith","Early stages but hopeful, and I think if we are -- as an industry, including banks, long term, going to successfully navigate the regulatory environment, we're going to have to do it as partners. And that's our intent, was to reach out proactively to some of the larger banks out there last year and proactively help them because if we can help them become more compliant on data accuracy, as an example, that helps us. So early stages.","Operator","Brett Huff from Stephens Inc.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One is on the restructuring, you haven't talked much about that. Can you give us a sense of where the restructuring happened? And I'm less concerned about the current period costs and I'm more interested in what are the benefits in terms of better margins? Will we see them -- where will we see them? And when will we see that?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. I'll take a crack at it and Lee, I don't know if you would, please. One, in the scheme of things, the size of restructuring we took is relatively de minimis. We take restructurings and repositionings very, very seriously because it impacts people's and families' lives. But the economic environment in which we operate isn't static. It's very dynamic. The opportunities you may have in one part of the world are not static, it's dynamic. So our challenge as leaders is to always make sure we are reallocating, repositioning our human capital resources and financial resources in order to get the best return. So it was nothing more than that and taking some areas that were offered lower growth and in cutting back expenses there and repositioning to higher growth areas. So that is a normal process in my 8.5 years here that we have done so many times over the 8.5 years. This is a little bit more meaningful and as we called it out as a non-GAAP item. As far as margin impact, Lee?","Lee Adrean","Yes. I mean, I think the other thing to about think our margins is that we continue to expect to grow our staffing over the course of this year. It will be at a modest rate and in line with a recognition of where our revenue for the year is going to grow. So this really is much more about realigning resources to where the best opportunities are. It helps us accommodate the softer revenue we'll see in the first half of the year. But for the year as a whole, you take our revenue growth, subtract a couple percentage points that has to go to salary increases, merit increases. That's going to give you just about what our headcount growth will be. And that's kind of consistent with the [indiscernible] model. So it's not really a margin-driving action so much as staying focused on where the returns are.","Brett Huff - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is -- and people have asked a little bit about NPI already. But can you just give us a sense -- you've been added, I think you said 6 or 8 years with a very systematic way of hitting singles and doubles and hopefully getting some triples in there, too. What -- as you guys look forward, how much of NPI is going to come from sort of brand-new data sets versus analytics or add-on products for existing data sets, so we have a better idea of kind of what -- how proprietary some of those NPI revenues are?","Richard F. Smith","That's an interesting way to ask. As you think about product, I'd say this. If you think of a continuum, I think the next 3 years, the greater NPI growth comes from mining the current unique data assets we have around the world more fully. There's a lot of juice, as someone had mentioned earlier on a comment, an earlier comment about juice left, and a lot of juice left in just mining the current data by taking those unique data assets to new verticals with unique data with unique domain expertise. The auto example is a prime example. We've had the wealth data -- or the employment data. We've had the income data. We've had all those data assets now for a few years. But getting domain expertise in the verticals, to focus on that and bring those through to deliver new products is an example. I think there's more opportunity over the next 3 years. We'll always go out looking for the next unique data asset. We've got a lot more we can still do and mine what we have today.","Operator","We'll hear next from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was hoping you could make a comment about credit card applications. Rick, I definitely heard you talk about prescreening up in the quarter. Do you think that was just sort of Christmas holiday related? What's your sense of credit card application as we're going into 2014? Often, it's a very big driver for you, but it hasn't for a while.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I'd say it this way, Andrew. Since the lows, the trough of the recession, you're steadily seeing that increase, in the last couple years anyways, the upper single-digit range, and we expect that to continue. But still, I think I mentioned before, 39%, 38% below the prerecession peak. So nowhere close to what we were before the recession, but I expect it to continue in 2014 and up.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And you're not just talking about the prescreen, you're just talking about the follow-through where you get the application, you get the consumer credit report as well, right?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, and I got to be -- the answer's yes, but I have not actually tracked the linkages we've done in the past between prescreen and credit file pool. I don't have that number off the top of my head. If you remember, there was a very strong correlation prerecession. I think it was 30- to 45-day lag between prescreen and credit file pool. That lag was impacted dramatically during the recession. I can't tell you exactly where it is today, but eventually, yes, prescreen leasing pools were up.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. So it sounds like moderate recovery.","Richard F. Smith","Yes. Thank you. And operator, I think that's about it. We're about 1\/2 hour over our normal time unless you have one more question that has to be asked from the phone.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue. Mr. Dodge, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Okay. I want to thank everybody for their time and their interest in Equifax. And I think with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you, everybody.","Operator","Again, that does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you, all, for your participation."],"8882":["Equifax, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trevor Burns. Please go ahead, sir.","Trevor Burns","Thanks and good morning, welcome to today's conference call. I'm Trevor Burns, Investor Relations.","With me today are Mark Begor, CEO, and John Gamble, CFO. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements including 3Q and full-year 2019 guidance, to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risk, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2018 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2019, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes accrual for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, cost associated with the acquisition-related amortization expense, the income tax effects of stock awards, recognized upon vesting or settlement, certain acquisition cost, and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets.","Adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax also excludes legal and professional fees related to the cybersecurity incident principally fees related to our outstanding litigation and government investigations. As well as the incremental non-recurring project costs designed to enhance our technology and data security. This includes projects to implement systems and processes to enhance our technology, and data security infrastructure. As well as projects to replace and substantially consolidate our global networks and systems as well as the cost to manage these projects.","These projects that will transform our technology infrastructure and further enhance our data security, were incurred throughout 2018 and are expected to occur in 2019 and 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Equifax adding back interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also is the case for adjusted EPS, excluding accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.","Costs related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, certain acquisition costs and foreign currency losses from remeasuring the Argentinian peso denominated net monetary assets. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website.","Now I'd like to turn it over to, Mark.","Mark Begor","Thanks, Trevor, and good morning everyone. As you know, this was a busy week in quarter for Equifax with Monday's settlement announcement, and our focus during the quarter on driving growth, operations in the EFX 2020 technology and security transformation.","Before I get into a discussion of our second quarter financial results in the business units, let me spend a few minutes discussing the announcement we made on Monday, about the legal settlements we made in connection with the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Monday's announcement was a real milestone and pivot for Equifax, which allows us to fully focus on operations, driving growth in our EFX 2020 technology and data security transformation. The comprehensive resolution we announced is comprised of multiple related settlement agreements with the consumer class action plaintiffs and the federal Multi District proceedings, the attorney generals of 48 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the New York State Department of Financial Services and resolve the claims and investigations brought by these parties related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident.","As you recall from our first quarter earnings call in May, we recorded an accrual of $690 million for expected losses associated with certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 incident. Principally as a result of the comprehensive settlement announced on Monday, we increased the accrual by approximately $11 million in the second quarter of 2019, resulting in total charges of $701 million.","This amount excludes the cost we have incurred to date offering free credit monitoring to US consumers in 2017, 2018 and 2019 for which we've already taken charges. Details of the settlement and related costs are available in the 8-K we filed on Monday. Importantly, the settlement program establishes a single consumer restitution fund that will be available to pay consumer benefits and legal fees and expenses and it is addition to the protections provided by Equifax immediately following the 2017 cybersecurity incident, including free credit monitoring in our Lock and Alert service.","A single consumer fund was a real priority for Equifax and is a win for consumers. The consumer restitution fund will be available to pay for 4 years of additional 3-Bureau credit monitoring for consumers, who's information was impacted by the 2017 breach, actual out of pocket losses related to the breach and other consumer benefits such as identity restoration services. Equifax will also be providing free single Equifax bureau -- free single-bureau Equifax credit reports were up to an additional 6 years. There are 2 circumstances in which Equifax could incur cost in excess of the $300 million consumer restitution fund.","First, to the extent that more consumers enroll in credit monitoring than contemplated in the consumer fund, Equifax would have to fund this cost. The fund is structured to cover credit monitoring enrollees of up to 7 million. Second, to the extent, consumer out of pocket loss has exceed the amounts available in the fund, Equifax would have to fund the amount of these incremental losses up $125 million. And as a reminder, we have not identified any instances of data being used for identity theft purposes or the data that was stolen being sold on the Dark Web. Our expected total $701 million accrual does not include any provision for Equifax incurring incremental cost for either of these two items, because we believe that $300 million in the consumer restitution fund will cover the expected costs.","The settlement represent resolution of many of the significant legal and regulatory issues facing the Company related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, including the consumer class action and investigations by state Attorney General, New York state DFS and our principal US regulators CFPB and FTC. There do remain other additional unresolved claims and litigation related to the 27 incident, a listing of these claims, can be found in our 10-Q which we'll file later today.","We intend to work with all the parties to bring these remaining matters to closure as soon as possible while balancing the needs of our company, employees, customers and shareholders. As you know, we prepared ourselves financially for this settlement by strengthening our balance sheet, including suspending our stock buyback program and freezing our dividend in 2017. Our current plans are to finance the settlement payments with existing borrowing capacity under our revolving credit and securitization facilities.","As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion of borrowing capacity available to us. John will provide more details on the expected timing of the payments and impact on our second half guidance in a few minutes. This is a very positive step forward for Equifax and for our shareholders. The settlement will not have an impact on our one point 1.25 billion technology and security program, our internal investment plans, new product introductions, payment of our quarterly dividend at the current rate or our plans to grow and expand Equifax with acquisition.","This resolution allows us to fully focus on the future. Let me move now to our results for the second quarter. We were very pleased with our second quarter financial results as revenue was at the top end of our guidance and adjusted EPS was above the range as we provided in May. These financial results are another positive step forward for Equifax. Revenue of $880 million was up 3% in constant dollar currency and up just over 1% on an organic constant currency basis and the strongest results since the cyber security incident in 2017.","During the quarter, US mortgage market inquiries were up about 2% compared to the prior year, better than our projection of down 1% resulting about 5 million of additional revenue in the quarter versus our May guidance. However, FX further weakened during the quarter relative to our May guidance impacting revenue negatively by about $2 million. Overall, the strength in the quarter was driven by our US B2B businesses, USIS, and Workforce Solutions. In the quarter, both USIS and EWS performed better than we expected. Both businesses performed extremely well online with USIS online up 10% in total and 6% organically. And worked -- Workforce Solutions verifier revenue was up a very strong 15% both businesses grew their non-mortgage online business stronger than we expected. In addition to benefiting from the stronger US mortgage market. In total, our US online business, which includes USIS online, EWS verifier in the GCS partner business represents half of our total revenue and are expected to grow about 10%. International was weaker than we expected in the quarter, particularly in the UK, I'll provide some more details on that in a minute.","Adjusted EPS of a $1.40 a share was above the top end of the guidance we provided in May, given lower than expected corporate expenses and slightly better than expected business unit margins from the stronger revenue growth. In the second quarter, total non-recurring or one-time costs related to the cybersecurity incident and our transformation exclusive of any accruals for legal matters related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, which I discussed a few minutes ago were $82 million and consistent with our expectations.","This includes $70 million of technology and security spend and $12 million for legal and investigative fees. We expect 2019 one-time costs related to the cybersecurity incident in our EFX 2020 technology and data security cloud transformation, exclusive of any legal accruals to be just over $350 million. To the extent, we are able to provide to further accelerate data exchange or Cambrian Ignite deployments into our cloud data fabric at Google or customer transitions to our interconnect API decisioning engines at AWS or Google spending could exceed these levels.","Shifting now to USIS. USIS revenue was up 2.5% on a reported basis, and down slightly on an organic basis compared to last year, but better than we expected. With USIS revenue, organic revenue up 1% excluding over 1 percentage point negative impact from the mix shift our mortgage business in the mortgage market. Importantly, we saw solid double -- We saw solid single-digit organic revenue growth in our USIS segment for the first time since the cyber incident.","This is a very positive sign for USIS. Sid Singh and is USIS team are back in growth mode and are showing some positive commercial traction in activity. USIS online revenue was up almost 10% on a reported basis and up almost 6% on an organic basis reflecting solid growth in our government and insurance verticals and double-digit growth in identity and fraud solutions aided by new product sales. This is a very positive sign of USIS recovery in the marketplace.","Online organic revenue growth, excluding the favorable impact of mortgage market and mix shift, was still up over 3% compared to last year. This was the first quarter of positive online organic revenue growth since prior to the breach. A very positive sign as we return USIS to a growth mode. Mortgage Solutions was down 22% in the quarter due to the mix shift, we have discussed previously with mortgage resellers, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018. Mix shift had a negative 2% impact on USIS revenue growth in the second quarter while the USIS operating profit was not materially impacted. We expect the revenue headwind from this mortgage mix shift to continue for the remainder of 2019.","Financial marketing services was down 7% compared to last year and was weaker than we expected. As we indicated consistently in our May discussion, our financial marketing services revenue is choppy, as the timing of closing deals is still not as predictable as it was prior to the cybersecurity incident. In the first quarter, FMS revenue was up 6% as we closed some large transactions. For the six months of 2019 FMS revenue will be down about 1%, this 6 month view has been relatively consistent for the past several quarters at about flat and much better than we saw in the 6 months through the third quarter of 2018, where revenue was down about 6%.","Looking forward to the second half of 2019, we expect growth in FMS as our strength in sales efforts drive growth off the relatively stable and flat base we have seen over the past nine months. In terms of customers, the USIS team is back on their front feet with growing new deal and new product pipelines, as we saw with a strong online growth this quarter. USIS new deal pipelines are up 2X from January 2018 and up over 30% from December 2019, which is a very positive sign for the second half in 2020. We continue to believe that our differentiated data assets coupled with our technology investments will return USIS to its traditional growth mode, but we do remain cautious on the pace of the recovery.","USIS adjusted EBITDA margins of 45.6% were down about 200 basis points from second quarter '18 primarily driven by increased royalty costs as well as the continued investments in security and data analytics to drive new product sales. USIS continues to very effectively manage SG&A costs while at the same time increasing the percentage of resources can dedicated to sales DNA and NPI and product development to drive growth.","Shifting now to Workforce Solutions, they had another very strong quarter with revenue up almost a 11% compared to last year and better than our expectations. Verification services delivered extremely strong results with revenue up 15% driven by strong double-digit growth across healthcare, talent solutions, mortgage and government. The strong verification services revenue growth reflects the continued growth in Work Number, active records as well as the new products and further penetration into key markets.","EWS has a deep and growing pipeline of new, twin contributors that they expect to add to their growing database in the second half of 2019. As you know twin records are monetized virtually immediately as they are added to our database and increased hit rates on our twin file. Employer services declined in the quarter less than 1% consistent with our expectations, driven principally by workforce analytics, our ACA business as well as our unemployment claims business. This was as expected with the strong employment market in the US.","Offsetting the decline in workforce analytics, we saw a slight growth in our I-9 and onboarding business. As we indicated last quarter, we expect employer services revenue to be down low single digit percentage for the full year. The strong verifier growth resulted in very strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 49.3%, an expansion in the quarter of 170 basis points. We expect EWS EBITDA margins to continue to be very strong in the second half. EWS continues to perform very well and it's a franchise business for Equifax.","Shifting now to international, where revenue was flat in local currency, and down 8.5% on a reported basis and below our expectations. Canada continued to perform well, consistent with our expectations. Australia declined in the quarter as we expected and we are seeing signs of stabilization in that market. However, the UK performance was much weaker than we expected, and although Latin America showed improved growth, the improvement was less than expected. Asia Pacific, which is predominantly Australia declined and expected 5% in local currency in the quarter, principally related to the weakening we began to see in the third quarter of '18 in Australia, consumer lending, particularly mortgage and other consumer and commercial credit markets in Australia.","We are beginning to see stabilization in the Australian market following their election, a few months ago, but we expect market growth to remain weak through the bulk of 2019, although the revenue growth impacts will begin to lessen in the second half as we approach the period of their initial decline in the third quarter of 2018. As I mentioned, we are seeing some positive signs in the Australian marketplace including lower interest rates and regulatory actions that have been taken that we believe may stimulate consumer and commercial credit demand in the second half.","We are also making very good progress on positive data in Australia, and by the end of this year we expect to have in excess of 80% of positive data from contributors.","Shifting now to Europe, our European business declined 3% in local currency in the quarter, a much weaker performance than we expected. The UK debt management business drove the largest portion of the decline, principally due to the deferral of debt placements by the UK government, which were not received until late June. As these debt placements we received late in the quarter, they did not generate the expected revenue from collection activity in the second quarter, but will deliver revenue in the second half. Our European credit business was down 1% much weaker in the mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth we have seen over the last year.","Online, which represents about half of credit revenue, grew about 5%, which although reasonable growth was down from stronger growth we've seen over the past year, project revenue also declined in the quarter due to timing of some deals that shifted into the third quarter as well as some customer delays, we're starting to see as a result of the Brexit uncertainty. Absent substantial weakening in the UK economy in the second half and as the Brexit approaches and hopefully gets resolved we're expecting to see a recovery in the growth of our European business, and UK business. Debt management is expected to see growth due to the debt placements from the UK government received in late June and expected growth over the remainder of 2019. And our credit business is expected to recover in the second half of 2019 due to solid deal pipelines and a much stronger leadership focus on improved execution.","Shifting now to Latin America, our business grew about 7.5% in local currency in the quarter. This has improved from first quarter growth of 5% but weaker than expected, principally in Chile. While we saw high single-digit growth in Chile this quarter, a couple of deals in NPI launches were delayed into the third quarter. We did see double-digit constant currency growth in Argentina and Ecuador and high single-digit constant currency growth in Paraguay in Chile, which was positive. We expect growth to accelerate in the second half as our Latin America businesses benefit from the expansion of Ignite and InterConnect SaaS rollouts and strong NPI rollouts in both 2017, 2018 and the first half of 2019, shifting now to Canada, which grew almost 9% in local currency in the quarter, reflecting a continued focus on customer innovation and new products and we expect this growth to continue through the rest of the year.","We recently announced that our Canadian leader Lisa Nelson will be transitioning to takeover our Australia business in about a week. Lisa has done an outstanding job bringing our Canadian business to market leadership through an intense focus on the customer. We're excited to bring this customer focused leadership to Australia. International adjusted EBITDA margins at 28.6%, were down about 190 basis points in the quarter, principally reflecting lower revenue and margins on Australia and the UK and slower growth in Latin America, partially offset by margin expansion in Canada.","Importantly, EBITDA margins were up sequentially 330 basis points, reflecting strong revenue growth in Canada and improved sequential margin in Australia from the fourth quarter and first quarter cost actions. We expect revenue growth in international to improve significantly in the second half, driven by continued good revenue growth in Canada accelerated growth in Latin America and a return to revenue growth in the UK and Australia.","We believe this improved revenue growth along with the full benefit of the cost reductions taken in the fourth quarter of last year and first half of this year will significantly improve margins in the second half of 2019. We're watching our international business closely, particularly the Australian economy and the UK Brexit impact. Shifting now to Global Consumer Solutions revenue declined 6.5% on a reported basis and 6% on a local currency basis in the second quarter, which was slightly better than our expectations. Our global consumer direct business was down about 6.5% and it was just under half of our total GCS revenue. Our US consumer direct business saw revenue declines of 8% versus 2018, in the quarter as a result of the suspension of US consumer advertising in the fourth quarter of 2017, after the cybersecurity incident.","As you know GCS began limited direct marketing to US consumers in late 2018. And we are starting to see subscriber growth from our restarted marketing and importantly US consumer direct revenue was up 3% sequentially. We expect to see US subscriber growth increase as we continue advertising in the year unfolds. In our Canadian and UK direct businesses, both also saw sequential revenue growth. Our GCS partner business which is about half of total GCS revenue declined 4.5% in the quarter through the timing of some project related revenue with customers that occurred in the first quarter.","We expect partner revenue to return to growth in the third quarter. We expect GCS revenue to be up slightly in the second half as we lap the periods where consumer direct revenue began to stabilize in 2018. Adjusted GCS EBITDA margins declined as expected in the quarter as we saw the effective revenue loss and an increase in advertising. We expect margins to increase in the second half as we see the benefit from stable and growing revenue as well as cost actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2018 and first quarter. Our GCS business is making solid progress recovering from a challenging 2018.","Now for an update on our EFX 2020 technology transformation plans. As you remember, there are 5 significant pillars to the cloud transformation and I'll give you a brief update on each of them. First , we're moving our credit and other data exchanges to a standard data fabric at GCP. In the second quarter, we saw a significant milestone, as our data fabric pattern based on GCP native tooling and including our full security stack was completed in the new GCP cloud format and made available to our business units to begin migrating their data exchanges to this new cloud environment.","Our USIS and EWS teams as well as our Canadian and corporate teams are actively working on migrating critical data exchanges to our new GCP cloud-based data fabric. Although data fabric was made slightly -- was made available slightly behind schedule, we remain on track to migrate several of our US and EWS exchanges including replicas of the US consumer credit exchange or ACRO, the Work Number exchange, NCTUE exchange, I-9 and unemployment claims databases to the common data fabric in the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year.","Also, beginning in July, any new datasets will be able to be directly ingested into our new cloud-based data fabric. We are at a place where our migration are now beginning to be tied to new customer workloads, so we will continue to update our delivery to align to near-term customer projects. As we discussed, moving from siloed databases, in the US, for example, we have close to 50 siloed databases, to a single data fabric in the cloud will enhance the speed and ease of accessing our differentiated data assets for our customers.","It will also allow us to add more differentiated alternative data assets to enhance decisioning for our customers. Second, we made very good progress and continuing the integration of our Ignite analytics environment and InterConnect interfaces and decisioning production platforms at EWS and soon in the Google Cloud. We've completed initial implementation of attribute services in Ignite with open source production languages, so that clients and customers can develop attributes in open source language and seamlessly deploy into Equifax platforms.","We are well on our way to having both online and offline seamless integration completed in the fourth quarter. The integration of Ignite and InterConnect will give Equifax a market advantage around speed and ease of moving from modeling, directly to production. Third, we are continuing to migrate customers from legacy decisioning and interface systems onto our cloud native Ignite, InterConnect SaaS product suite. Progress on this effort is now accelerating. For example, USIS continues to deploy the new cloud native products on to which they will migrate existing customers. Although we were slightly behind schedule on completing these standard patterns and migrating customers, we still expect to complete the migration of a significant majority of our customers by the end of this year and continuing into 2020.","Fourth is our network migration. In the second quarter, we achieved another significant milestone enabling for dual redundant high speed cloud integrations in the US, they will allow us to move traffic securely and directly between our cloud vendors and from our cloud vendors to Equifax to substantially improve network performance and strengthen security. This is a critical step in taking full advantage of the virtual private cloud strategy enables us to begin to eliminate our legacy technical debt. We will expand the use of this capability in the US over the rest of the year and into 2020 as well as deploying this capability in Canada , Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific in the second half.","And last, our global consumer systems and customer and consumer support system migrations continue to progress as planned. While many of the support applications that our customer facing, they are expected to significantly enhance the efficiency of our sales organization as well as the operational effectiveness of our client delivery and call center teams. In the fourth quarter, we launched myEquifax consumer portal and we are quickly adding consumer accounts to this new database. The new capabilities will enhance our customer service and allow for low cost cross sell of Equifax or partner products to consumers.","Last quarter, we started to discuss some of the benefits we expect from the EFX 2020 technology transformation to the cloud. We continue to find our view of the top end line benefits and John will update you on our current thinking. But we continue to be energized about the benefits that will be delivered by the cloud transformation to both our top and bottom lines. I hope this gives you a sense of the positive progress, we are making in our technology transformation that will deliver new cloud-based technology to our customers.","We remain committed to strong progress against our milestones in the second half.","I also want to give you a quick update on our progress with FICO, on the commercial and technology partnership we announced in March called Data Decisions Cloud. Our teams are working extremely well together and making great progress both on the technical integration of our capabilities and the commercial discussions with our joint customers. The first 3 joint product launches include number one, connected platform which integrates FICO's Decision Management Solution with Equifax Ignite -- Equifax's Ignite decisioning sandbox, interconnect and Equifax data in a cloud environment. We believe this combined solution will deliver functionality that is not available in the marketplace today.","Second, AML connect will integrate Equifax's differentiated data with FICO's AML and KYC platform to offer a full service end-to-end compliance offering that we believe will offer best-in-class search match capabilities and insights to the marketplace. And number 3 pre-screen central integrates FICO's marketing solutions suite with Equifax is differentiated consumer data to deliver a current turnkey direct marketing solution through our joint customers. We're making great progress on these 3 new product collaborations and expect to identify additional ways to leverage our joint capabilities in our FICO partnership for new product offerings in the future.","Shifting the new product innovation, this remains a key component of our strategy and a long term muscle for Equifax. We have an active pipeline of over 80 NPIs and new products at various stages in the funnel. And we expect to launch about 60 new products in 2019 , which is a similar pace from the past 3 years. While new product introductions primarily came from international markets last year, about 40% of the new products introduced this year are from our US businesses.","This is a good sign as we collaborate with customers to bring new products to market. On the M&A front, in May, we announced the acquisition of PayNet a leader in unique commercial lending data and insights. Customer feedback on the PayNet assets is very strong and integration activities with USIS are proceeding very well. Our USIS data acquisition -- our USIS data ex-acquisition from July 2018, which brought a unique set of US near and subprime consumer data is also performing well and ahead of plan. M&A is an important growth lever for Equifax and we continue to look for new opportunities to expand our data sets around the globe through M&A.","So wrapping up, this was a pivotal quarter for Equifax, which we delivered several important steps forward toward our goal of returning Equifax to market leadership and growth. Number one, Monday's legal and regulatory settlements was a big step forward for Equifax by resolving a significant issues including the consumer class action, State Attorney Generals, FTC, CFPB and New York Department of Financial Services facing as following the 2017 cyber event. This resolution allows us to more fully focus on operating and growing Equifax and driving our technology and data security transformation.","Second, second quarter was a solid performance for Equifax operationally. EWS delivered very strong top line verification growth with expanding margins and it's a clear franchise business for Equifax. USIS took another big step toward the recovery with 2.5% growth and 10% online results. We are focused on second half execution in International after a disappointing second quarter results with some macro headwinds in Australia, Argentina and the UK.","Third, we continue to execute on our EFX 2020 cloud technology and data security investments. As we discussed last quarter, we are convinced that our move to the cloud will differentiate Equifax from competition and deliver always on capabilities, bring speed of new products to market, allow us the ability to move products and technology more quickly across our global platform and we expect the investment to enhance our revenue growth and deliver double-digit savings to our technology spend and capitalized development costs. And last, we continue to execute on our strategy of adding strategic acquisitions. PayNet is a great example of the kind of bolt-on acquisitions we will look to add to the Equifax portfolio. And looking for ways to leverage our differentiated assets and decisioning assets with partnerships like Fokko. We know we still have a lot of work to do, but we are energized about the momentum behind our EFX 2020 initiatives and we expect continued positive operating progress through the balance of 2019.","I'm more excited than ever about our future as a market-leading data analytics and technology company. John will share more detail, but we remain committed to our prior 2019 guidance, adjusted for the financing costs from the settlement payments.","With that let me turn it over to John.","John Gamble","Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis, but will refer to non-GAAP results, as well. As Mark covered our overall results and the business unit details, I'll cover some corporate items overall margins, free cash flow and our guidance. The finalization of the Consumer Settlement was a significant step forward for Equifax and we now have a clear view of the timing of near term payments including to the MSAG, CFPB and NYDFS and the initial $25 million contribution to the consumer restitution fund.","In total, we expect to make about $350 million in payments in 3Q'19 against the $701 million in charges taken in the first half of '19. We intend to fund this initially with commercial paper issuance and have included related interest expense of about $0.03 per share in second half '19 in our guidance. The timing of the remaining approximately $350 million payment to the consumer restitution fund is uncertain, but not expected to be made before 1Q '20 and we therefore have not included any interest costs related to this payment in our guidance.","As Mark mentioned, we continue to make good progress with our technology transformation.","This includes progress in estimating cost savings, we hope to achieve, when we have fully executed the transformation and the incremental capital to execute the transformation is fully depreciated. There are 2 areas in which we initially see savings. First , we have estimated the savings we hope to achieve in the technology portion of our cost of goods sold. Based on analysis of cost to operate our US consumer credit exchange at GCP in a virtual private cloud versus our current premise-based system.","This analysis was done both working with our technology partner GCP and compared to general studies from industry consultants. Based on this analysis, we hope to achieve savings in the technology portion of our cost of goods sold of 15 plus percent. For perspective, our technology cost represents just over half of our total COGS excluding any one-time costs related to the technology, and data security transformation second is development capital and expense. The move to dramatically more standard cloud native offerings should substantially reduce our cost to develop and deploy new products and applications. Our belief is, on the order of 25%, this impacts both development capital and expense. We will continue to refine our view on cost savings in the second half, when we cost our EWS twin database on the data fabric. We remain energized about the top and bottom line benefits of our technology transformation.","For all of 2019, US mortgage market inquiries are expected to decline slightly versus 2018, which is stronger than the down 2% we had expected in May. 2Q '19 inquiries were up 2% versus the down 1% we had expected In May, increase in 3Q '19 and 4Q '19 are expected to be up 3% and 4% respectively. We are on track to deliver the savings from the resource realignment we executed in 4Q '18 and first half of '19. Total savings from the two combined actions are expected to exceed $60 million in 2019 with second half savings exceeding first half by about $10 million. Savings were generated across FX, but were most substantial incorporate international and at Workforce Solutions.","In the second quarter, general corporate expense was $135 million excluding the non-recurring costs associated with the 2017 cybersecurity incident and technology transformation, the adjusted general corporate expense for the quarter was $68 million, up $5 million from 2Q '18 but better than we had expected. The increase versus 2Q '18 predominantly reflects the increased investment in security and transformation and related technology, as we ramp of those costs in first half '18 and increased variable compensation given the timing of hiring certain executives last year.","This was partially offset by savings from our 4Q '18 and 1Q '19 restructuring plans. We expect 3Q '19 and 4Q '19 corporate expenses on average to be at the levels similar to 1Q '19. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.7% in 2Q '19 down 130 basis points from 2Q '18 and better than our expectations. As we discussed in May and as is covered in Mark's results -- comments, the decline in overall adjusted EBITDA margins year-to-year is principally driven by global consumer, principally due to the reduced consumer direct revenue and a return to marketing spend in 2019.","We expect substantially improved margins at GCS in second half of '19 as revenue begins to recover and they benefit from cost containment actions taken in the first half. International and USIS also saw margins decline, but to a much less extent than GCS. Strong growth in margins at Workforce Solutions partially offset these declines. For 2Q '19 the effective tax rate used in calculating adjusted EPS was 24.6% in line with our guidance. We expect our calendar year '19 tax rate used for adjusted EPS to be just under 24.5% 3Q '19 tax rate should be below 23%.","In 2Q '19 and first-half '19 operating cash flow of $217 million and $248 million were down $18 million and $107 million respectively, from 2018. For both periods, these declines were more than driven by the following non-recurring items. In 2Q '18 and first half '18 Equifax received $45 million and $80 million respectively of insurance proceeds offsetting costs incurred related to the cybersecurity incident. Equifax received no proceeds in 2019. 2Q '19 and first half '19 investments in security and transformation of $82 million and $179 million were up $10 million and $28 million respectively from 2018. And payments in 2Q '19 and the first half of '19 related to the $57 million of charges taken in 4Q '18 and 1Q '19 for cost reductions were $10 million and $21 million respectively.","Capital spending or the incurred cost of capital projects in 2Q '19 and first half of '19 were $103 million and $98 million, up $11 million and $49 million respectively from 2018. We expect capital spending to be about $385 million for the full year, higher than our original guidance of $365 million reflecting incremental spend on our technology transformation. Excluding payments related to settlements of litigation or regulatory actions, as we look forward, we expect to deliver positive free cash flow in the second half of '19 and for the full year 2019 free cash flow should exceed $200 million.","Now turning to our guidance for 3Q '19 and full year 2019. For 3Q '19, we expect revenue to be $865 million to $880 million, up 4.5% to 6% in constant currency. Mortgage inquiries are expected to be up 3% and FX is expected to negatively impact revenue by about 1.5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be 1.41 to 1.46 per share. FX is expected to impact adjusted EPS negatively by $0.02 per share and lower tax benefits in 3Q '19 versus 3Q '18 are expected to negatively impact adjusted EPS by about $0.06 per share. Our improved revenue growth in 3Q reflects growth acceleration at USIS, continued strong growth at Workforce, international moving back toward more normal growth levels and GCS moving back toward flat revenue. Adjusted EPS also returns to growth in 3Q. This despite tax is representing about a $0.06 per share or 4 percentage point headwind versus 3Q '18. 3Q '18 had a low tax rate of below 19% due to discrete benefits that will not be repeated in 3Q '19. We are seeing nice growth in operating income in the quarter.","The full year 2019 guidance we provided in March and May of this year, excluded the impact of any significant settlement charges. This quarter, we are including in our guidance, the financing cost of funding the Consumer Settlement. Our 2019 guidance ranges for Equifax revenue is unchanged from the previous guidance we provided in May with revenue between $3.425 billion and $3.525 billion. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is being adjusted by the $0.03 per share for the cost of financing the Consumer Settlement, and is now between $5.57 and $5.77 per share.","We expect revenue to be above the midpoint of the range and adjusted EPS to be toward the bottom of the range. Our guidance for 3Q '19 and 2019 implies a strong 4th quarter with better than seasonal sequential growth in revenue and operating profit. Looking at 4Q revenue, we expect strong sequential growth to be seen in USIS reflecting the normal seasonal growth and financial marketing services and a better than normal sequential performance in online. Workforce will continue to show strong growth, better than their seasonal pattern, particularly in verifier and international should show sequential growth in 4Q, but consistent with seasonal patterns.","GCS revenue is expected to strengthen as we move through 2019. In terms of operating profit, we expect the 4Q '19 stronger than seasonal sequential revenue growth to deliver stronger than normal sequential BU operating profit growth. This, along with the cost reduction announced in 4Q '19 in first half '19 and cost containment actions being executed will further benefit sequential margins in International, GCS and Workforce as well as corporate. Delivering our second half performance requires strong execution across our commercial teams as well as continued focus on firmly managing costs throughout 2019.","And with that operator, we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you, good morning, guys. Mark, in your prepared remarks you talked -- I think you alluded a little bit too, but you still being a little cautious. And I was wondering if you could just elaborate on that in terms of -- is the recovery or the better results you're seeing and guiding more sort of catch up from what you lost. So maybe, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the competitive environment and your visibility improvement?","Mark Begor","Yeah, Manav, it's a great question. We do still remain cautious. We kind of had now three ","quarters from USIS, where they've delivered either at or above our expectations. And as I mentioned -- John and I mentioned, second quarter is one of those, and we're very pleased with the online growth. We also mentioned the growing pipeline in USIS, which is a really positive sign. We're really pleased with the new leader. But then you look at some of the businesses, for example, our financial marketing services business, they had a strong first quarter. I think we talked about that in May, that we thought that, was probably a bit stronger than what we expected, because of a couple of large deals and then in the second quarter, they were below our expectations and that business is still on its recovery mode. So we're very pleased. I think I used the words that second quarter was a very strong step forward for USIS. It's a business that competitively we're in the marketplace, we have yield pipelines that are up 30% from year end and 2x from 18 months ago, there is no question that we are back in the marketplace. I'm really pleased with our leader there, who's no longer new to this sort of things. He's bringing really commercial leadership, but it still takes time to rebuild all of those relationships and as you know the deal closing pipeline while we are seeing some progress on that conversion, that's still not at a historical level. So I think that's what we are still watching. But we've laid our guidance for the second half, where we expect that business to continue grow and recover as we go through the second half.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then just another one from me. Just on the tax savings you talked about or at least referred to, just to clarify, like maybe some color on the timing around which, do you think you can get there? Is that the end state or is that kind of what the project should deliver without the other costs along the way where we might not see the absolute 16% and 25% that you guys referred to.","Mark Begor","Yeah, what we're trying to do Manav is, give some visibility to what we expect this cloud transformation to deliver and as, you know, in the last 90 days or so, we're starting to share with you and other investors where we see some of the cost benefits, that's probably easier piece and they're quite substantial. And when you just talk about the cost benefits, those numbers, we've talked about the 15 to 20 on our tech costs in 25% on our development costs, those are on a run rate basis when we're fully completed and we're not giving visibility yet past 2019, but we've also talked about the fact that we expect those benefits to roll into 2019, 2020 as we work through the full implementation of this technology transformation. And we're just not ready to give a date when these benefits will fall to the bottom line. We're also working to try to quantify what our expectations are about the topline benefits, we think we're always on capability, the speed to market, the ability to move products around the globe, we're also going to help us on our topline.","So we're going to have additional costs which we try to -- it's in our guidance for 2019, we'll put it in our guidance for 2020 around the tech transformation and migration. And then we should start seeing benefits as we retire legacy debt this year and next year and we'll give guidance once we are ready to do so, on what we think the full transformation is going to deliver, we're just trying to give some perspectives that we think it's going to be quite positive for Equifax.","All right. Got it. Thanks a lot.","Mark Begor","Thanks, Manav.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Judah Efram Sokel with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Judah Efram Sokel","Hi, thank you for taking my question. First one is just about guidance for EPS for the year. I just wanted to make sure I understood that the total change to guidance was simply because of the interest expense related to the settlement or is there any other shifting of costs, perhaps an acceleration of the tech, tech spending, as you mentioned the 350?","Mark Begor","The guidance that John shared is, we're sticking to our prior guidance with only the change of the financing cost we have from the settlement payments in the second half. That's the only change we are making.","Judah Efram Sokel","Okay, perfect. And then my other question was just around USIS margins, you had a lot of helpful color on margins in the other segments as well as revenues. I was just wondering if you could help us think through more specifically USIS margin expectations for the back half of '19.","Mark Begor","Yeah. So our expectation is, I think we've mentioned in the script is, we're expecting USIS margins to also improve as we get through the back half of '19. As their revenue continues to grow, since we're seeing nice growth in online, the expectation is, we'll see continued improvement in margins as the online variable margins are very high.","Judah Efram Sokel","All right, thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Great. Thanks so much. Hey, really helpful color on the TTI initiative around the expense. I know it's early in terms of quantifying what the revenue could be, but is there a way to kind of frame it relative to kind of NPI where you'd expect it to be above that. And then just within the context to the FICO partnership, when should we start to see the revenue associated with that kind of start to come into the numbers, and I don't think there's anything in the guide for that, is that right?","Mark Begor","Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. On your first one, we're not ready to talk about what our expectations are around the revenue. And we tried to give some color on the expense benefits from our cloud transformation. So, I guess, stay tuned. As we work to refine that, we want to share that with you as we bring it forward. But we clearly believe it's going to be positive for Equifax on the top line and that's as far as we've gotten on that.","On the FICO partnership, we're in the marketplace, we've got joint deal pipelines, we haven't landed any revenue yet, nor we've given any revenue guidance on that, and my guess is it, we won't give specific guidance on that revenue. It will be a part of Equifax's revenue and of course FICO is going to benefit from two as part of our joint revenue sharing in that. But I just wanted to give an update to you and other investors that, that project is continuing, there is great momentum with it and there's really positive customer reaction to it, particularly around the Data Decisions Cloud where we're combining FICO's decisioning software with Equifax's Ignite InterConnect and Hardline piping in our data. And we believe that there'll be a set of customers that are going to really be attracted to that turnkey solution as well as the other products that we're working to bring to the marketplace.","Kevin McVeigh","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.","George Mihalos","Hey, good morning, guys. Wanted to ask on the international side, specifically for APAC now, as the comps sees in the back half of the year, it sounds like you're expecting a return to modest growth over the back half, but then as we start going into 2020 and all the progress you've made related to positive data, would you expect positive data initiative to benefit APAC growth in as early as 2020?","Mark Begor","Yeah, we're not ready to give 2020 guidance, of course, but we've been consistent around -- we believe positive data is going to be attractive to our Australia business and we expect some benefits in the second half. And as we get closer to 2020, we will give you some perspective on 2020, but it really goes to the premise that more data is going to be attractive for us and it's going to be more data is going be attractive for our customers and it more data opens up more revenue opportunity source.","George Mihalos","Okay. And then, John, just a point of clarification, if we look at USIS revenue growth of 2.5% I think as you talked about, if we look at that organically -- your -- it's down slightly. I think something like 50 bps or the math work, something like that. If we sort of adjust for the impact from mortgage solutions, thanks to the mixed shift which again is kind of voluntary and the benefit that you've gotten from mortgage in the quarter. Is it safe to say that sort of on a normalized basis USIS were sort of sort of flatish.","John Gamble","Now, it's up about one, right. I think we try to put that in the script. I think it's up about one. And again, as you look forward, right, so we're seeing nice progress in online as Mark talked about quite completely and then the financial marketing services was down in the quarter and we expect to see growth in financial marketing services, when we get into the back half. So when you think about why are we getting comfortable that we're going to see some improved growth out of USIS? It's really the momentum in online and then financial marketing services starting to grow again. And those two pieces that we need to deliver on clearly, it requires execution. As Mark said, lots of execution for that to be true, but that's the basis on which we're getting comfortable, we're going to see improved performance in the back half.","George Mihalos","Okay, thank you.","John Gamble","Further improve. It was already been improving, further improved performance.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni Kaplan","Thank you. I'm still not a 100% clear on the EPS guide. So, you mentioned you lowered the guide by $0.03 from the interest expense and then -- but you beat this quarter by like $0.05, $0.055 and now you're saying you'll comment toward the bottom end of the range. So I'm essentially thinking of that as outside of the interest expense, basically up to $0.15 guide down and so I just -- I'm not understanding what's driving that?","Mark Begor","Our full year guidance, as we said, was only adjusted for the $0.03. Yes, we had a good quarter and as we talked about last quarter, right. For us to deliver the full year, we needed to have very strong execution as we were expecting substantial improvement in USIS and then across the business broadly. And I think what you saw in the second quarter is good direction toward the improvement that was necessary for us to be able to deliver the full year that we talked about in May. And that's why we repeated the guide here that we did in July. So, the execution to continue to show the improvement that's necessary for us to deliver the year, I think it's what you're seeing in our guidance and hopefully improve confidence in our ability to deliver it. And that's very important to us and that's where we're focused.","Toni Kaplan","Okay. And then on M&A, from your comments, it sounded like acquisitions contributed over 250 basis points or roughly to USIS a little higher than what I was thinking, should that continue? Is that the main driver of the revenue guide being above the mid point now? Thank you.","Mark Begor","No, no. So again you got to remember DataX was acquired in July of last year. So we are like most companies right -- we -- in our organic calculation, we just -- we consider the acquisition for its first year to be incremental. But beyond -- now that we have comparable period starting in July, that will move to organic. Right. So it isn't driven just by acquisitions. You're seeing improved performance broadly. And again, you can see a nice big step up. Hopefully, on year-over-year in FMS.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Ashish Sabadra","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick question on the FMS improvement going forward, is that related to the timing of closing the deals, which got pushed out from the second to third quarter?","John Gamble","No, I think as Mark talked about, we closed some large deals in 1Q that just didn't repeat in 2Q. I don't think we made any comment about anything pushing out. I think the comfort we have is that if you take a look over some longer periods, we said it's choppy. Right. So if you want to kind of watch the choppiness out of the results, you will look over slightly longer periods and over those longer periods basically, we've been performing kind of flat over the past nine months. So we feel we are getting comfortable that we've stabilized at that flat level and we're starting to see funnels grow and our expectation is better performance as we get into the back half.","So, that's really what it is. If you go back to last year, we'd said, well, you'll start to see improvement in our sales execution as we got into the back half of '19 based on the fact that we had a year to sell once we were free to sell again, following the cybersecurity incident. And effectively our forecast for USIS represent success at that model. So again, as we said, we need to execute, and it is a substantial effort for us to do but that's what's built into our forecast. Our forecast assumes success in that selling effort and therefore growth in those businesses.","Mark Begor","I think I'd add to that that we gave you some visibility around the USIS new deal pipeline, which includes FMS in there and that's up substantially from a year ago. And of course up substantially from the beginning of the year. So that continues to built. So that gives us some of the confidence that the teams out there in real commercial discussions of transactions that will benefit the second half and I think John mentioned in FMS that it's also seasonality that typically a stronger in the second half and of course, last year we were still working on the post cyber. We view that we're a more normal commercial -- in a very normal commercial mode today versus where we were a year ago.","Ashish Sabadra","That's very helpful. And maybe just and why; as we saw some pretty good improvement even excluding PayNet and mortgage. How -- can you just give any more color on any particular verticals or products that drove that strength. Thanks.","John Gamble","And I guess I think Mark included in his script, right. We saw some strength in insurance, some strengthening and performance in government. Identity and fraud, which are really separate business has also performed better and nicely and saw some growth and quite honestly the momentum and banking lending is improving. Now banking and lending obviously has the acquisitions in it, but the momentum is improving and we're expecting that momentum to yield in the second half. So those are all areas where we feel -- where we had improving performance in the second quarter and are expecting continued performance going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.","Tim McHugh","Yes, thanks. Just wanted to add a higher level talk about maybe the technology transformation. This may be too high of a summary. But I think you talked a little bit about some small parts of the projects that are -- maybe started or a little bit delayed relative to the original plan, you also talked about spending more than you had originally planned this year. I guess. I think the spending was conveyed in a sense of strength in terms of opportunities to do this, but I think just to address the question, I'm sure I'll get questions from people who will take those other two data point and try and talk about the difficulty of the project. So can you just in that context maybe talk about how you're progressing and I guess the confidence and the kind of the pathway that you've laid out to achieve the overall technology transformation?","Mark Begor","Yeah, first off on the spend. I think we tried to be clear Tim that our current forecast is to spend what we've already committed to you, so no change in that. We did give the caveat that, if we see some opportunities to accelerate migrations in particular, we might spend a little bit more. But it's going to be in that same framework. We're not having overruns or things like that, we didn't want to give that impression, because that's not the case. The one area that was a bit more complex than I think we anticipated over the last 90 days with the build-out of the data fabric at Google Cloud, that's now complete. We had hope to complete that maybe 30 to 45 days earlier. But it was completed a month ago and it's in the hands of all the business teams. But we're just trying to be transparent. This is a big project. There's a lot of pieces to it. One of the ways we try to derisk is it was breaking it down into pieces and are -- we're attempting to just be transparent and what you know where we're going on it and how it's progressing. Overall, we're very pleased with the progress, the teams are embracing it. Customers are very excited about it. Our dialogs with customers about the overall investment, where we're going to take it, the benefits they're going to get, as well as the migrations of things like InterConnect and Ignite to the cloud environment are very, very positive.","John Gamble","And, Tim, capital is up a bit. We did say capital would be up a bit in the year. And I think the way you should think about that is, capital is more driven by build than migration. Right. So I think as Mark talked about, data fabric is built and moving InterConnect built and moving, we made some commitments around and are executing against things we're doing very nicely with Ignite and integrating Ignite and InterConnect, that's all build. Right. And then also quite honestly, when we gave the guidance in the beginning of the year, the investments we are going to need to make to do important partnerships like FICO weren't necessarily in our guidance at the time.","So you're seeing increasing spend around some of those things, but it's more around the build activity which is upfront and then the migration activity. So I think you should view it as good progress and in the context of the $700 million to spend or just over $700 million to spend, we're talking about, we still think we're in a pretty narrow band with an adjustment during the year of about $20 million. So we're not feeling like there's big overruns, as Mark indicated, and the capital is really around the build segment, which we think is progressing and some things have been added that weren't in the original guidance that we gave you back in February.","Tim McHugh","Okay, great, thanks. That's all I had.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, good morning and thanks for the commentary on how you're thinking about savings over time from the technology program. I guess one area of that, that we haven't heard a lot about is how you're thinking about potential reinvestment for a portion of those savings? Would it be right to think that a lot of that fall to the bottom line or are you more likely to reinvest a significant portion of that as you continue to drive innovation and trying to drive the topline?","Mark Begor","Yeah, it's a great question, Gary. And as you might imagine that's one that we're thinking a lot about and we're not at this stage to talk about it. And of course, we're not at the stage where we're ready to put our financial framework, back in place. But there is no question we expect there to be benefits. We're going to look hard at what portion of those benefits that we plowed into more new products, into more growth and what portion do we bring to the bottom line to increase our margins and we'll have some clarity on that as time progresses and share it with you.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then just the follow-up to that. In a couple of public appearances during the quarter, it sounded like you were indicating that completion of the program could slip beyond 12\/31\/2020 timeline initially, is that -- I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that, is mid 2021 more realistic target given what you know at this point or where you are thinking today. Thank you.","Mark Begor","Yeah. What we tried to do, Gary, in all of our discussions is to be clear with you that our intent is that the incremental spend that we have in ' 18, '19 and '20 will end in the end of next year and then anything that's left to be done, and there certainly will be elements of this cloud transformation that is going to flow into 2021. It's not going to be 100% complete. We do expect to complete a lot of the work between now and the end of next year and then anything that's required after that, our intention is, that, that would go into our normal operating expenses and normal capitalized costs as opposed to the incremental spend that we've been doing for the last 18 months and then we plan to continue for the next 18 months that was the kind of boundary we put around it and we're still sticking to that.","Gary Bisbee","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Bill Warmington","Good morning , everyone. So I feel like it's been a while since we've heard anything about the commercial business. It used to be its own division up until a few years ago and -- but now we've done an acquisition of PayNet which is B2B data around commercial lending and leasing. And then you also mentioned strength in the USIS B2B business. So I wanted to ask, what's changed there and how are you thinking about the B2B business going forward?","Mark Begor","Yeah, it's still an important business for us. As you know, that's why we made the PayNet acquisition, because we knew we'd enhance our position commercially. In the earlier comments when we talked about B2B, that was really referring to our online business with our normal customers versus the commercial business.","Bill Warmington","Got it.","Mark Begor","The business is, we didn't talk about it in our prepared remarks, but had growth in the quarter that was similar to the overall business, so it's performing quite well.","John Gamble","Ex-PayNet the commercial business has actually done very nicely this year and with PayNet it's only accelerating. So as you know, as you remember that we made substantial investments in building out the CFM and that's improving. We did, -- we integrated SBFE. So we think we have a very good partnership here, we announced earlier in the year that we are one of the -- we're very early and think we have outstanding risk scores in commercial and have won some significant new customers. So that business was making progress on its own. And with PayNet we think it's going to accelerate.","I think it's been going -- we mentioned on the May call that we were so impressed with the PayNet leader that, he is now leading our US commercial business, which combines our core commercial business with the new PayNet assets and business. And we're really energized about the last 60 days as he's been out in the marketplace really driving that business","Bill Warmington","And then, a housekeeping question. You didn't explicitly give the organic revenue growth for the 3rd quarter, I just wanted to check that it, it looks like it's probably about 2.5% to 3% by just need to run that by you.","Mark Begor","Yeah, we didn't give guidance on organic growth in the 3rd quarter. So you are correct. We did not. But, again, please remember right that DataX is no longer inorganic starting in July. Right. So because we acquired them a year ago to this month, so the amount of acquisition revenue actually declines.","Bill Warmington","Got it. Okay.","Mark Begor","From DataX.","Bill Warmington","Okay, got it. All right, well thank you very much.","Mark Begor","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff Meuler","Yeah, thanks. Mark, question on pipeline conversion in USIS. And I guess what I'm wondering is, is the slower conversion and historical -- is it just a function of, you've had a lot come into the pipe recently, so therefore is that an earlier stage, but it's progressing through as normal or has the selling motion and hurdles that your clients are putting you through changed because of the breach or maybe some other factors, just -- can you just help shape it up for us, please?","Mark Begor","Yeah, it's definitely not the latter, Jeff. We're in normal commercial mode and there is no change I would characterize it today than it was in 2017 prior to the cybersecurity breach. If anything, our commercial discussions are more positive, meaning that we've got a dialog around new data assets, we've got a dialog around our technology transformation and how we're going to deliver more capabilities to our customers. Your comments in the pipeline, were right on. The pipeline, as we said is up 2X over what it was at the beginning of last year and is up strong double digits, from the beginning of the year.","So the pipeline is growing. And as you pointed out, some of those opportunities are newer and the lifecycle on those on when they get actually converted, vary -- everyone varies, but generally newer items have a longer tail on them than more mature items in the pipeline. So really good news that the pipeline is growing and is at increasingly high levels and the comments about -- we continue to be watching the conversion is, it's just not fully mature yet, when we'll get there is hard to forecast as far as maturity to pipeline, but clearly every day we're getting closer to that. And it should continue to progress in the 3rd quarter and 4th quarter, and our leader there, Sid Singh, who is driving the business is really bringing a lot of drive and energy around the commercial side of the business and of course I'm still spending a bunch of time with our US customers to continue to help drive the USIS return to their historical growth.","Jeff Meuler","Okay. And then let me take a 3rd shot at EPS guidance question. So I'll ask it this way, you're guiding revenue above the midpoint of the prior range, you're guiding EPS to the low end and what's typically a good incremental margin business. So is the offset something with mix, with, I don't know, UK and Australia, or is there increased investment just if you could maybe the 3rd time is a charm, I think.","Mark Begor","So, I think as you take a look at our back half, what you'll see in our back half is improving revenue growth and growing margins, right. So what I suggest we do is, not look at this kind of relative to guidance movements, but relative to absolute performance. And I think what you're seeing is, improvements across both and that's what we would expect to try to deliver and it is what we think we're delivering.","Jeff Meuler","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Online Information Systems has accelerated to 10% growth in the second quarter, can you break out how much of the growth is coming from PayNet and how much is coming from improving underlying performance post the data breach?","John Gamble","Yeah. So, George, we gave organic growth and it's at","Mark Begor","36%.","John Gamble","Yes. So of the 10, 4 was 4 was through from acquisitions and that's just not PayNet, that would be DataX as well. Right. Because data was, as we said, bought in July of last year.","George Tong","Right. And if you were to break out the impact between PayNet and DataX instead X will be rolling off next quarter, how would you split the difference?","John Gamble","Yeah, we didn't give revenue of each, but they were not that different in size.","George Tong","Got it, that's helpful. And then, a follow-up question around margins, your EBITDA margins contracted 130 bps year-over-year in the second quarter. Can you discuss what expectations for margins in the second half of the year are embedded in your full year guidance and what factors you have that you see that can drive better margin performance in the second half?","John Gamble","Yeah. So again, we think our margin performance improves as we go through the year and again that's driven by the growth rates we're seeing in revenue, in general. Right. So I think it's similar -- similar to the answer I gave to the last question, it's really the same here. And that's our expectation, as we go through the rest of the year. I think as you take a look at our EPS guidance relative to our revenue guidance, again, you're starting to see us forecasting improved EPS -- adjusted EPS, sorry, in the second half and that would go along with the improved -- the improving overall profitability.","Operator","Our next question will come from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Could you just talk a little bit about the competitive situation in online? I'm just trying to understand was the 6% organic growth coming from white space that you guys have created with some of your NPI or you just become more competitive in the marketplace? Are you taking business from a competitor? Can you just kind of talk about that a little bit and then I'll have a follow-up.","Mark Begor","Yes, it's pretty broad base. It's hard to put on one item. We're clearly back in the marketplace. We're working with existing customers to try to increase our share with those customers, so that's helpful . I think we talked about the fact that we reentered the FinTech space really 12 months ago, and we've got almost a dozen commercial people there and so that's I'm talking about the US, which is your question. So there are some wins happening there in the marketplace. And then, as you pointed out, we're in there with NPIs I'll leave PayNet and DataX out of it, just talk the organic phase, we're in there with NPIs that drive new online volume, and it's fairly broad-based and it's what you would hope to see with equifax, getting back into a more normal commercial mode.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then, I guess, a similar vein type a question just on the UK. If I could look at the UK performance versus say, like, what I'm seeing from call credit. Now, I understand that there is different mix of business over there, but it still seems like there's a dichotomy between the growth that you guys are having and what they are having. Can you talk to that a little bit or do you compete with them directly. Is it really a difference in mix, and like-for-like you think you've grow on the same way, if you could just elaborate on that?","Mark Begor","I think we talked about that we've seen some pressure from Brexit in just some of the NPIs in the UK. We didn't expect that, we didn't see it in the first quarter. So there was some pressure there. We talked about -- are you focused on the credit side, the debt management business, I think we talked about some new business from UK government moved over from second quarter into in the third quarter. So we're expecting that business to get better as we go into the second half, it's hard to forecast the Brexit impact, but we're watching that business closely.","John Gamble","And if you look at our credit business, right, we set our online business grew mid single-digit and have been growing high single-digit , which we think is very good and probably consistent with what you're seeing from other people actually, I think there has been other results reported in the quarter that, that were not quite that high. Right . So the difference for us was our -- was offline right, was the back -- was the deal business and we just had an execution issue in the second quarter, it's relatively , it's basically consolidated to that. So our expectation is -- as online will continue to perform and that will improve our execution in the back half.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. Can I just squeeze in one last thing just on the settlement. There is going to be another $350 million or so that gets paid in 1Q '20 is that the way to understand that?","Mark Begor","We don't have clarity on the timing of that payment as we've tried to be clear. It could be, you know, as soon as then, it's driven by the court approval process and when we have clarity, then we'll share with you.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And there is highly unlikely to be 7 million people signing up for this. What happens if there is excess funds? Does that get kicked back to you, they gets absorbed by other sales?","Mark Begor","No, it stays in the fund and there is various ways that is used to fund other consumer activities, but the consumer benefits, but nothing comes back to Equifax.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Trevor Burns for any additional or closing remarks.","Trevor Burns","Thanks everybody for joining the call and I'll be around today if anybody has any questions. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's call, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8508":["Equifax (NYSE:EFX) Q4 2011 Earnings Call February  9, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeffrey L. Dodge - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Richard F.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time,  I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Good morning, and welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2010 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Equifax, which excludes acquisition-related amortization expense, a tax benefit in the fourth quarter and the loss on the merger of our Brazilian operations with Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os. Since our Brazilian operations will merge with Boa Vista on June 1, we also present revenue growth excluding Brazil to provide a clearer understanding of our revenue growth for the businesses and will continue to be reported in our operating results.","These measures are detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation, included with our earnings release and posted on our website. Please refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation and our other various Investor Relations presentations posted on our website in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab on our website for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","I think you'd all agree 2011 was a very solid year for Equifax. In fact, it was a year in which we saw accelerated organic growth as each quarter unfolded. In the fourth quarter, organic non-mortgage revenue growth accelerated from 8%, up from 7% in the third quarter and 4% in the first quarter. And by the way, total organic growth, when you include mortgage, was actually 9%, the strongest we've had in quite some time.","Throughout the year, we continued to invest in critical growth -- revenue growth initiatives, ending the year with $75 million in CapEx and $127 million invested in strategic acquisitions around the globe. We also invested our shareholders, returning over $220 million in the form of dividends and share buyback.","Our investments in new product innovation continue to pay great dividends. In 2011, we generated very strong double-digit growth in new products for risk services, Verification Services, fraud, technology and local services and marketing. In fact, for the year, we launched a total of 69 products around the world, and that allowed us to expand into new markets and gain share with existing customers as well as new customers.","Taking a quick look at some of the high-level financials for the quarter. Obviously, Lee will give the detailed financials later on. Total revenue from continuing operations is $510 million, up 6% from a year ago. If you exclude Brazil, total revenue was up 10% for the quarter and up 11% in constant dollars. Operating margin was just as we expected, 24.7%, up 190 basis points from a year ago, obviously benefiting from the operating leverage that we get as well as deconsolidation of our Brazilian operations. Finally, adjusted EPS from continuing ops was $0.68 a share, up 10% from $0.62 a year ago.","And now, as I normally do, I'll go through some business highlights. Our internally-generated momentum in 2011 positions us very well for strong growth this year. The environment of our customers is obviously very different than what it was just a few years ago before the recession. Our strategy has enabled us to adapt extremely well to the emerging needs and provide high-value solutions that help -- will help them be more successful in this challenging environment.","So here are the highlights. I'll start with USCIS and move through all 5 of them. First, USCIS had an outstanding year, exiting with double-digit revenue growth, expanding its operating margin by 120 basis points over the fourth quarter of a year ago and, like their peers around the world, launched 13 new products as NPI becomes an integral part of their growth. ","We exited the year with broad-based growth and volumes across all sectors, including financial services, that's the large financial services, regional financial services as well, telco, mortgage and our channel partners, really, truly broad-based volume growth across all entities for USCIS. They also delivered $23 million or 3 percentage points of their growth from NPI, and these are products that were built over the last 3 years, so great success there.","Here's a few highlights just so you have some sense for where that 3 points of growth is coming in -- coming from for USCIS. One is the launch of a new database that includes positive payment informations from the telecommunications, utility and satellite video companies. We've talked about that before. That was a strong contributor for them in 2011 and will be stronger in 2012. Number two, unique products, such as personal income models and enhanced debt income ratings, which obviously help our clients make more discerning credit and account management decisions. Number three, digital marketing services, which utilize unique Equifax wealth data to better target Internet ads. And we talked about that for the last couple of years, a great growth product for USCIS.","Number four, products like Undisclosed Debt Monitoring, which we launched a few years ago, help mortgage lenders reduce fraud. Five, products that help our clients comply with new regulatory requirements like Reg Z. Number six, new applications for enabling technologies to help our clients manage account relationships more effectively. And seven, services to help investors evaluate mortgage-backed securities using our consumer credit data and superior matching technology.","Given the breadth and diversity of our data assets, we've also broadened our distribution channels. For example, we launched a major growth initiative in the insurance sector, and the results are very encouraging. We also increased our resources and strength in our disciplined and strategic pricing to ensure that our pricing reflects the value of our customers receive and realize selected improvements where value is unique.","Our customers increasingly recognize the power of our analytical solutions for the year. 44% of the files we delivered to customers contained at least 1 Equifax annuity products. This is particularly impressive when you consider that we have increased our penetration in each for the last 3 years, starting from 28% back in 2008.","Customers in USCIS are very interested in our value-added offerings that intensified throughout the year. You've already witnessed it through our competitive wins in our NPI initiatives.  To further support growth from these high-value solutions, we continue to invest in our Technology and Analytical Services while broadening and deepening our analytical capabilities. These investments will continue to contribute to the USCIS growth in 2012 and beyond. So just a great year, a great ending, a great momentum for USCIS.","International, they successfully delivered on a number of important strategic initiatives last year, they strengthened our market position, gained market share, made strategic acquisitions across their served markets and they also obviously combined their Brazilian assets with our key partners in Brazil to become a strong and formidable competitor in a very important growth market for us.","A couple of highlights for International. The new management team in the U.K. achieved significant penetration -- market penetration through intense focus on their customers' changing needs in what continues to be a very competitive environment, just a banner year for the U.K. team. ","Early this year, we acquired Workload in the U.K. It's an information solutions company with investment data assets, very similar to IXi here in the U.S. We're leveraging the management team, products and analytics expertise in IXi to further develop the business opportunities and establish a unique capability in one of our larger international geographies. I've got high hopes for that product over in the U.K. in 2012 and beyond. ","In Brazil, we have fundamentally altered the competitive dynamics by combining our business assets in Brazil with Boa Vista. Now a much stronger competitor in a fast-growing market, the integration of our operations is well under way, now making great progress and now focused on developing new products and driving strategic growth initiatives in Brazil. Boa Vista is benefiting from the overall market growth in Brazil, and we continue to be very excited about our venture and the opportunities that lie ahead.","We also closed on credit bureau acquisitions in Ecuador and Costa Rica last year, which will expand and broaden our revenue growth opportunities across the fast-growing Latin American geography. Our investment that we made a few years ago in Russia is generating very strong returns for Equifax. During the year, we grew revenue in excess of 70% and increased our ownership from 28% to 33%. We'll continue to step up that ownership in 2012. ","India is also progressing well and in line with our expectations. We now have 250 data contributors, over 149 million records loaded already into the database, and we launched 12 new products last year for our Indian customers. ","We continue to make very good progress in our high-value solutions. In 2011, we launched -- we strengthened relations with our customers and realized further market penetration as revenue for our Technology and Analytical Services product line excluding Brazil was up a nice 20% across International properties.","NPI activities in International, like everywhere else, contributed significantly to our revenue growth. In 2011, 15% of our International revenue was driven by new products introduced since 2008, substantially above our corporate target of 10%.","Our competitive position in International could not be stronger. In those markets where we have the largest share, we've strengthened our customer relationships through innovation and intense focus on customer service. In markets where we do not have the largest share, we have gained share or improved our competitive position through innovation, strategic investments and strong management discipline.","On now to TALX. TALX Workforce Solutions made great progress on our strategic initiatives despite headwinds in the mortgage market. The actively employed record count in the Work Number database increased now to over 51 million records, up 5% as 280 new companies contribute over 5 million active records and inactive records for the year. The Work Number database now over has 210 million records, which is a great accomplishment. TALX further expanded its ability to grow actively employed records from mid-market employers through partnership agreements which provide access to a significant amount of new active records, and they'll be the benefactor of both partnerships starting in 2012 and beyond. ","The acquisition of DataVision, a provider of low-cost manual verification and workflow management services, and eThority, a provider of sophisticated HR analytics solutions, will significantly deepen our relationships with customers who purchase our employment and income verification solutions and the employers who contribute records to the Work Number database.","On the PSol. 2011, I think you'll agree, was a record year for PSol. Record revenue, improved operating margins, rigorous management discipline and execution and increased market penetration. They delivered growth of 15% for the year.  That growth was driven in both subscribers -- for the year, driven by growth in both subscribers, which were up 6%, and average revenue per subscriber, which was up 11%. And we have migrated to a more of a feature-rich set of products. Again, NPI is a big part of the story and PSol as well.","And with an intense focus on their critical operating metrics, such as churn, conversion rate, cost per account acquired and value-added pricing, operating margins improved by 160 basis points to 30%. There's great momentum in PSol, and the customer experience is getting better every day. We fully expect to continue to making market share gains in 2012 as we continue to introduce new products and further improve our customer touch points.","Finally, North American Commercial Solutions delivered double-digit revenue growth driven by U.S. risk, which is continuing to take market share by leveraging both the quality of our data with analytics to deliver high-value solutions to our customers. Our performance in 2012 -- 2011 underscores that even in a relatively mature business environment, new regulations and business challenges create new opportunities for us to deliver above-average growth by meeting our emerging needs for our customers with unique and powerful solutions. Business model linking unique and diverse data assets, analytical innovation and capabilities and proprietary decision technology is, in fact, enduring.","Now, as always, Lee, if you can now go through the financials, it'd be great.","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations, generally presented on a GAAP basis. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.","The resilience of our core business activities along with continued execution of our long-term strategy enabled us to deliver our strongest quarterly performance in 2011. Compared to the same quarter in 2010, the fourth quarter of 2011 consolidated revenue of $510 million was up 6% on a reported basis and 10% when Brazil is excluded from both years. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue was also up 6% on a reported basis or 11% excluding Brazil.","Operating margin was 24.7% compared to 22.8% for the fourth quarter in 2010, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $0.60 per share, up 20% from the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding a cumulative multi-year tax benefit and the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.68 a share, up 10% from $0.62 in the fourth quarter a year ago. Also during the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of stock for $67 million.","Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $216 million, up 13%. Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $137 million, up 17%, driven by improved market demand, the addition of select new customers, new products and certain pricing actions. Fourth quarter online volume was up 17%, significantly exceeding the 9% growth through the third quarter.","Mortgage Solutions revenue of $33 million was up 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Core mortgage reporting was up slightly due to a favorable level of refinancing activity when compared to the fourth quarter in 2010. And Settlement Services benefited from further customer penetration and delivered strong double-digit growth during the quarter. The Mortgage Bankers Application Index was down 6% in the fourth quarter of 2011 from a year ago.","Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $46 million, up 2%. We noted at the end of the year that while demand in our transaction-based businesses held up well, our project-based businesses like Consumer Financial Marketing Services experienced some softness as corporate buyers deferred discretionary projects in the face of global economic uncertainty.","The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 37.5%, up from 36.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010.","Our International business units revenue was $116 million in the quarter. Excluding Brazil, following our deconsolidation of that unit in the second quarter, reported revenue grew 10%, and local currency revenue growth was 12%.","By region, Latin America's revenue was $45 million. Excluding Brazil from the prior-year comparison, reported revenue grew 10% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency. The analytics and marketing services product segments were particularly strong, although all major product segments delivered double-digit growth during the quarter.","Europe's revenue was $42 million, up 15% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. Strong double-digit organic growth in the U.K. and the acquisition of Workload earlier in the year offset weakness in Iberia.","Our Canada Consumer information revenue was $30 million, up 3% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. Growth was generally consistent across all product lines. Finally, International's operating margin was 28.7%, up from 23.6% in 2010, reflecting primarily the deconsolidation of Brazil in the second quarter.","Moving on, as many of you already know, we have changed the reporting format for TALX to be more consistent with how we are now operating that business unit. As a result, we will be reporting TALX Workforce Solutions, the new name for the business unit, along with 2 lines of business: Verification Services and Employer Services. Verification Services includes our employment, income and Social Security number verification services, while Employers Services includes our Tax and Talent Management Services as well as certain complementary payroll-based transaction processing services which previously had been included with Verification Services.","For the quarter, TALX Workforce Solutions revenue was $106 million for the quarter, up 3%. Verification Services, with revenue of $55 million, was up 11% for the quarter. 10% growth in non-mortgage verification revenue and the acquisition of DataVision more than offset the double-digit decline in mortgage-related verifications.","Employer Services revenue was $51 million, down 4%, reflecting a modest decline in unemployment claims activity and reduced hiring by the TSA, our largest client for Talent Management Services. ","The TALX operating margin was 23.2%, down from 24.4% in Q4 of 2010, largely driven by changes in mix within our Employer Services offerings and the additional acquisition amortization from the acquisitions DataVision and eThority.","North America Personal Solutions revenue was $46 million, up 21%. New subscriber growth and a significant improvement in average revenue per subscriber, as Rick described, were the primary drivers of overall growth.","Operating margin was 30.5%, down slightly from 30.9% in Q4 of 2010. North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $26 million in the quarter, up 6% on both a reported and a local currency basis. Strong double-digit growth in U.S. transaction volume was partially offset by lower Data Management project revenue, again, as economic uncertainty resulted in caution by corporate buyers relative to new client marketing programs.","The operating margin for our Commercial Business was 34.4%, up from 32.3% in the year-ago quarter. Finally, corporate expense was up 6% when compared to the fourth quarter in 2010.","For the full year, consolidated revenue from continuing operations was $2 billion, up 5% on a reported basis and 8% when Brazil is excluded from both years. Operating margin for the year was 24.0% compared to 23.1% for 2010. Our tax rate for the year was 37%, and we expect our 2012 tax rate to be roughly similar, although this can vary by -- vary quarter-to-quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Equifax was $1.87. Excluding the impact of the loss on the deconsolidation of Brazil, a tax benefit in the fourth quarter and acquisition-related intangible amortization, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax was $2.52, up 9% from $2.31 in 2010.","And during the year, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of stock for $142.3 million. Net of shares issued for equity compensation plans, shares outstanding declined by $3 million over the course of the year, and our available share repurchase authorization at year end is $112 million. ","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Lee. It's a fact [ph] that 2011, I think, by any measure, it was a really solid year. Our team executed at a very high level against the strategic growth initiatives that we set forth a few years ago. That combined with a modestly improving economic environment in most parts of the world gives us great momentum as we leave 2011 and enter 2012, obviously entering with our fastest core organic growth rate in the fourth quarter we've had in years. ","Now looking forward.  The first quarter, assuming the current exchange rates and excluding Brazil, is expected to deliver revenue growth from continuing operations between 9% and 12%. Every business unit is expected to deliver high single- to low double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be between $0.64 and $0.67 per share for the quarter, which will be up somewhere between 10% to 16% when compared to the first quarter of 2011. ","Now a look forward for the full year. Our outlook for the full year is for solid growth from each business unit. For 2012 when compared to 2011, we're assuming no real economic improvement in the U.S. In fact, our base case is around 2% GDP growth in the U.S. and a modest recession in Europe.  With that being said, I will now walk through some expectations for each of the 5 business units. ","Starting with USCIS, where we expect, for the year now, USCIS to deliver solid mid- to upper single-digit revenue growth, both will be higher in the first half of the year when compared with the second half of the year as we anniversary certain products and some pricing initiatives and customer penetration wins we had in mid-2011. We'll also continue our aggressive investment in NPI to significantly enhance the long-term value of our products and services to our customers in USCIS. ","Now TALX Workforce Solutions is expected to deliver upper single-digit growth for the year as they continue to drive NPI market segmentation and expand the record count for the Work Number database, somewhat like USCIS.  Maybe a slightly higher first-half growth for TALX versus the second half for the same reasons. ","Third, on the PSol, we'll leverage the momentum from 2011 to deliver double-digit revenue growth. Again, in 2012, we will continue to invest more in marketing to support our long-term growth outlook for that business. Our Commercial Solutions business made great progress in 2011, developing stronger market position, growing revenue, expanding their operating margin. For 2012, we expect solid double-digit revenue growth once again.","International, excluding Brazil, is also expected to deliver low double-digit growth for the year, leveraging its #1 market positions in Canada and Latin America along with further market penetration in the U.K. So solid, solid growth across all 5 business units again in 2012.","Overall, our operating margin for the year should expand approximately 50 basis points as we benefit from the leverage we get from the accelerated growth. For the year, we expect internal investment in CapEx to be once again in that range of $75 million to $95 million. ","Now we haven't done this in a while, but I want to also to provide a framework for you to think about as we think about the next 3 years and what kind of growth we expect the business to have. And, obviously, that model I'm about to lay out will include 2012. I said before, we've got a great team, a team I'm very proud of. They're executing at a high level.  That will continue. We're going to continue to capitalize on our unique assets of data, and as a result of that, I do see a clear path to a sustainable 7% to 10% top line growth over the coming years. Adjusted EPS should grow 3 percentage points faster than the revenue due to a combination of operating margin expansion year-over-year and our financial leverage.  Combine that with our dividend, that represents a 12% to 15% for our shareholders as we look forward for the next 3 or 4 years. So solid model and good returns for our shareholders.","So with that, operator, we'd like to open the phone line to any questions our audience might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Carter Malloy with Stephens.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","First off, you talked about growth before Brazil. But can you talk about sort of core Equifax organic growth if we skin out mortgage, how that looked in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, if we saw any pickup or deceleration there?","Richard F. Smith","I thought I broke that out. If I didn't -- yes, so if you take out inorganic and you take out mortgage, the core growth was 8%. If you just look at total core organic growth, including mortgage, it's 9%.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the 8% ex mortgage compares to, I think it was at 7% in the third quarter?","Lee Adrean","Correct.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great, great. And then can we talk a little bit more about mortgage? The mortgage environment -- it's a 3-part question. So first of all, just overall mortgage environment and the impact on you and your 2012 outlook and guidance.  Second part of that is within mortgage, it sounds like Work Number is a lot more origination-related than refi, so I want to clarify that. And then third, sort of a bigger picture, as we're looking at an AG settlement that's likely imminent and a flood of work on behalf of the banks for principal reductions and modifications, what type of work, if any, will you guys gain there, and how does that benefit, if it does, Equifax?","Richard F. Smith","I'd call that a run-on sentence, Carter. Let me see if I can -- overall, when we think about mortgage for the company for 2012, we have built a business plan that is assuming about a 20% decline in the mortgage market. So obviously, if there's any increase or pickup beyond that 20% forecasted decline, that's a benefit for us. And conversely, if it declines at a fast rate from 20% to negative. I think -- if anything, I think that 20% is solid, if not conservative. That answers the first part of your question. By the way, if you've read some of the reports that have come out recently, the refinancing is fairly strong in the month.  It was fairly strong in the month of January and is continuing in February. So rates are obviously in historic lows.  That's helping, and we benefit from that. But specific to Work, you made a statement about the more origination-focused rather than refinancing. They benefit from both. And the refinancing, they also get an impact as -- and pickup as well. So if refinancing picks up, that does benefit the Work Number. And the last question you had was basically a regulatory change with California. I think you're referring to New York coming in. And it's uncertain right now. If anything, that's a potential upside for us. We have not factored in that upside into our business plan.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, but it sounds like you're sort of agnostic towards refi versus origination. Both those things are positive or negative?","Richard F. Smith","Correct.","Operator","Next up, with SunTrust, we'll go to Andrew Jeffrey.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Question on USCIS top and bottom line in this quarter and looking forward. Seems like pricing in light of the accelerating volume growth was pretty stable. Just wondering about kind of what the one-time contributions were to the extent there were any. And then as a corollary, when I look down to the EBIT line, given the strength in revenue growth, might have expected a little more leverage in the segment, operating leverage. Can you, Rick, just talk about whether this is a structurally kind of different business than it was pre-financial crisis in terms of the sustainability of the operating leverage?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. One, I alluded to a little bit in my comments, and Lee may have as well, the performance you saw in the fourth quarter of USCIS was extremely broad-based, which is -- which helps. It's as broad-based as I've seen probably dating back to 2005, where you had great growth in our large FIs, great growth in our regional banking customers, great growth in telco. Auto was up, channel partners up, and just everything we had was strong growth. I've mentioned somewhere in my comments the fact that we continue to invest heavily in pricing resources and discipline, and we've been doing that for years. We stepped it up dramatically in the last 18 months in USCIS, helping us think about bundling their products, segmentation of products, positioning of products. Show you understand [ph] the values our customers get, the ROI they have and the enterprising we should have. And that's helped Rudy and his team, at least in the fourth quarter, negate some of what we typically see as price compression. As far as sustainability, yes, I think that the path we're on in USCIS of leveraging these unique data assets to expand the pie and gain share is, in fact, sustainable, that was represented in my comments, with virtually no more help from the broader market in 2012. I expect USCIS to have another really good year. On leverage, there's always mix that plays in, Andrew. I mean, if my memory is correct, jump in, Lee, I think the margin expansion was 120 basis points. First -- fourth quarter 2011 over fourth quarter 2010, that's great leverage. And you always have some mix. Mortgage had a nice little uptick in the fourth quarter. Mortgage tends to not be as high a margin as other products like OSIS. So all in all, I say it's a very, very good performance top to bottom.","Lee Adrean","And Andrew, the thing I would add is that one of the ways we are driving growth is not simply waiting for the traditional bank customers to order credit reports for issuing credit cards. We're expanding, we're doing more with analytics, we're expanding our position in telco, we're expanding our position in insurance. And -- but to do that, we have to scale the organization. We're adding some salespeople, we're adding marketing people. So to drive the kind of growth that we're driving does require some added resources to expand our footprint, both from a product perspective as well as a customer perspective.","Richard F. Smith","Good point.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is there anything -- and that all makes good sense. Is there anything structurally, Lee, that you think would prevent this business from being a 40-plus-percent EBIT business the way it was in the last cycle? Or has the world just shifted a little bit, and that's not the -- an attainable long term goal? I'm just trying to frame up in the context of Rick's long-term outlook the segment profitability.","Lee Adrean","Yes. I think this business continues to have great profits characteristics. I think we've also tended to say that people should think about steady margin improvement, not big pops, because we are also investing in the growth opportunities to drive higher growth. So we have to get there over some period, yes, but it maybe longer than the -- what -- if you simply think about an incremental fall-through on traditional business, we're not going to get there at the rate that would imply. But we do think there's good runway.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Rick, I mean, I'm very encouraged to hear you -- your willingness to comment on sort of a long-term view. Is it safe to assume that as you look at the broad, at least domestic financial institution landscape that we're back to a more normalized environment? Because you've been somewhat circumspect with regard to giving longer-term guidance since, I think, for almost 5 years now, 4 or 5 years.","Richard F. Smith","That's a great question. A word of clarification. No, I think we're back to normalized -- if normalized is the 2002, '03, '04, '05, '06 time frame, no we're not there. But it is -- it definitely is an improving -- modestly improving environment in the U.S. versus the last few years, Andrew. So my bullishness on the future is predicated upon kind of that modest improvement in the U.S. economy, a modest recession short-term in Europe, but then it's really predicated upon the team's ability to execute. And I've said this to a number of our investors and analysts over the past 6 to 9 months. We've invested heavily on the ability to execute as a company. We've invested heavily in bringing in some great talent to the company. And as a result, the team has executed at the highest level I've seen in my 6.5 years here. So it's really that, that gives me the confidence to give you a multiyear outlook.","Lee Adrean","Again, I would reemphasize. It's just not executing on the things we've always done and squeezing a little bit of incremental growth. It's expanding our footprint with new -- it's the kind of revenue growth addition we can get from new products and entering or expanding in some market segments.","Operator","Next up we have Michael Meltz with JPMorgan.","Nadia Lovell - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Nadia Lovell in for Michael Meltz. I just have a couple of questions. Personal Solutions accelerated throughout the year. What's behind that? Have you changed marketing strategy at all?","Richard F. Smith","Oh, yes, that has been a top-to-bottom -- new leadership. I think it's been 18 months ago or so we [indiscernible] that Trey Loughran, he's brought a new team with him. A new focus on metrics -- we've got some background noise [indiscernible] on the phone.","[Technical Difficulty]","But heavy focus on churn, heavy focus on dispersion, heavy focus on new product innovation. We're more aggressive in the marketplace and advertising as well, driving subs, increasing our ARPU. So yes, top-to-bottom kind of overhaul of that PSol product.","Nadia Lovell - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then I have another question. In Brazil, are you getting to a point where you can start to increase your ownership stake beyond the current 15%?","Richard F. Smith","We have the vehicle, as you know -- we announced this -- when was that? Mid-last year.  There were a series of triggers that allow us to do so. We have not done so yet. We're actively involved in the process of integrating the 2 companies, driving new product to market, gaining market share. So on the operational aspect, forget the ownership for a second, operationally, we're doing everything we've set out to do and may be slightly ahead of pace.","Nadia Lovell - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. My last question.  How should we think about your free-cash-flow priorities in 2012 in terms of acquisition versus share buybacks?","Richard F. Smith","Certainly.","Lee Adrean","Yes, I think they continue to be -- what we've said before, it's hard to plan for acquisitions, because we try to be extremely disciplined in the ones we pursue. But acquisitions, when the right ones present themselves, that will always be a priority in comparison to share buyback. Share buyback, the rewards are probably more immediate. But acquisitions that may help us expand our footprint in logical ways where we can bring leverage through our skills and capabilities, where those bring assets to us that leverage into our base, create more long-term value.","Operator","Next with Evercore Partners, we have David Togut.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Rick, you were pretty explicit in terms of your revenue growth assumptions for each of your 5 business units for 2012. Can you give us a little more granularity on your expectations for margins for each of the 5? And perhaps in conjunction with that, give us a sense of where you have more investment versus last investment for the year ahead.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, no, David, we don't break out, at least at this juncture, the margin book. I can tell you that in general terms, where -- PSol is at a very, very high level of margin. I think the margin last year was 30%. I don't think you'll see much expansion there. You'll see businesses like Commercial at a very high level, modest upside in Commercial. Lee, you jump in here as well. I would expect in 2012 similar margins in TALX, expanding margins in USCIS and some expanding margins in International.","Lee Adrean","Yes, I think that's right. And I would emphasize, at a total company level, we are very committed to delivering moderate but steady improvement in margin. But business by business, we'll have some businesses where we're investing in a given year. We do not try to manage consistent, steady improvement margin for every business every year. That becomes too constraining. But at a total company, very committed to improvement.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And Lee, you touched on unit volume versus pricing online CIS. I apologize, I didn't catch the numbers. What were they again in the quarter?","Lee Adrean","Our unit volume and our revenue were up about the same.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, so price flat.","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just finally, Lee, the tax rate in the quarter was toward the low end of your guidance, I believe. Can you give us an insight into tax rate for 2012 in terms of what's embedded in your outlook?","Lee Adrean","I think what we've said for the year, the tax rate was 37% and, give or take, I would say 36% to 38%. That can float around a little bit. States are taking various actions. Frankly, the government's taking various actions. They tend to work against us, not help us, not surprisingly. But we are always looking for things that we can do. So I would simply say 37% plus or minus for the year, and it will tend to fluctuate by quarter.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And just finally, Rick and Lee, you significantly increased the dividend, I believe, about a year or a 1.5 year ago. What are your thoughts for the dividend for the year ahead?","Richard F. Smith","Good question, David. We remain committed to that 25% to 35% that income being redistributed back to our shareholders in the form of dividend. We, in fact, have a Board meeting tomorrow. We'll discuss that tomorrow. But our anticipation will be we'll make a move up with the dividend this year.","Operator","Next up we have Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One quick question. If you go back through the pieces of the model, and I guess I'm mostly focused on the USCIS, to a comment that you made, Lee, about the discretionary spending environment. If you sort of think about the business against volume sensitivity, discretionary spending versus recurring spending, is there a way to sort of think about how much of your business is potentially discretionary versus volume-sensitive versus recurring? Just trying to get a sense for -- the stability the business, obviously, is pretty strong. So as we go forward from here, what would be the potential exposure to any continued sort of sluggishness on the discretionary side?","Lee Adrean","Yes, it's really the -- what I would describe as discretionary project-oriented spending tends to be concentrated in our Consumer Financial Marketing Services aligned within USCIS. And even that, as some portion of that is subscription-based and some portion are the kind of one-time marketing studies or more discretionary types of projects, I haven't looked at it closely lately, but if you take even half as being discretionary and half as locked in to subscriptions, it's probably more subscription than that. And CFMS is 20% of USCIS. 20% -- USCIS is predominantly transaction-based. And as I said before, we've seen transaction activity performing very well.","Richard F. Smith","And the only thing I'd add there, Julio, if you think about the marketing piece of USCIS, which Lee just mentioned was 20%, a big chunk of that was actually -- is up -- it was solid in the fourth quarter. Our triggers were solid, our portfolio reviews were solid. It was just a piece of the 20% that was, I'd call discretionary that was slightly down. And as I think about that -- even if that is a little volatile, our discretionary spend, the market demand is starting to strengthen, and our execution on growth initiatives is actually in a very high level as well. So I think you have to think about that in context.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Definitely. And maybe just to think about the FI environment. Over the last couple of days, whether it's consumer spending, consumer loan volume, even the transaction volume data that we've seen out of the Visas and the Mastercards of the world suggest that credit, as a product, seems to be doing really well. Obviously, for you guys that has some implications. So can you sort of help us frame a little bit about sort of the FI conversations coming out of the CARD Act now and kind of post-urban world, what is the FI attitude and view about new credit, new account-on-file growth and continue to sort of drive that expansion as we go into 2012 from here?","Richard F. Smith","I describe it as improvement. As -- we spent a lot of time our there with our banking clients, it's not euphoria, but it's improving. Cautiously, optimistically improving. It feels better -- if I categorize a tone today, it feels better today than it's felt in a number of years. Auto lending feels pretty good. Credit card loans and issuance feel pretty good. Refinancing is strong. Obviously, home origination and new mortgages, still sluggish. Small business lending, still a little sluggish. Midsized to large corporate lending, improving. So the overall tone would be one of modest improvement.","Operator","Next up, with Barclays Capital, we'll go to Manav Patnaik.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could maybe add to that in terms of sort of what your free-cash-flow expectations are? I know you gave the CapEx range of $75 million to $95 million, but I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on what your expectations are for free cash flow?","Richard F. Smith","Lee, take that one.","Lee Adrean","Yes, I would expect free cash flow to be relatively consistent. Obviously, we get a little bit of bump because our earnings are higher. The D&A will be a little bit higher. Though cash from operations should be up some, look at CapEx in the middle of a range would be up a little bit. Rick indicated dividends are likely to be increasing more or less in line with earnings, and that will lead to free cash flow, i.e., cash from ops less CapEx and dividends, in the $250 million, give-or-take, range. And that's what we've got available for acquisitions or share repurchase.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And the other question I had was relative to, I guess another way to ask what's sort of your subscription basis. But relative to the balance sheet deferred revenue item, how should we -- with a lot of other subscription companies obviously tend to focus on that item, but how should we tie that item on your balance sheet to your revenue trends?  Because it clearly seems to be going in different directions.","Lee Adrean","Yes, the decline in deferred revenue really resulted from the deconsolidation of our Brazilian business, which had some deferred revenue. I think our subscription business is not a large part of what we do, but the deferred revenue on the balance sheet would generally tend to perform with our business. This year, really a function of the deconsolidation of Brazil.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, I guess, just some housekeeping for the quarter. In terms of the -- what was the acquisition contribution? I think it was 1.6% last quarter.  What was that this quarter?","Richard F. Smith","What is this quarter, is that a -- first quarter?","Lee Adrean","Q4. Q4.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, fourth quarter, sorry.","Richard F. Smith","Just under 2%.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And the expectations in this 9% to 12% guidance for the first quarter?","Richard F. Smith","Is your question how much of the 9% to 12% is...","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I guess what your -- correct, yes.","Richard F. Smith","I don't have it broken out, Lee, do you?","Lee Adrean","I don't recall. It's going to -- it's probably a little bit less than that, just because I think we've got something that's falling off in the 12-month anniversary.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, roughly that will be -- that's more close to 1%, 1.5%.","Operator","We'll now go to Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So back in early kind of December, Latin America obviously had a good quarter. But you had mentioned that you were seeing some modest slowdown there. And with the 14% local currency growth this quarter, I'm just wondering, did that kind of reverse from what we saw?  Or were kind of October and November just really strong months, December kind of played out as it was? Or are we starting to see kind of reacceleration back there?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I don't actually recall the discussion saying we're slowing. The growth in Latin America was broad-based. It was across all countries, like we've seen now for quite some time. And not just all countries, but all -- mostly all products across all countries. So as I look at Latin America and I look at 2012 first quarter and total year, I think the growth we're seeing there is definitely sustainable.","Lee Adrean","Yes. And I would add second and third quarters, excluding Brazil, Latin America was growing in 16% for us.  It slowed slightly. The GDP growth generally in Latin America is slowing slightly. But with a broad range of our products, our revenue is holding quite well.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, super. And then with Brazil's integration going well and I think you mentioned that your focus now is on new products, can you just comment on the areas of kind of new product development where you think you have a competitive advantage to that market?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. I think it's -- obviously, leveraging the size and the scale that both these companies bring together. And that's taking the price [ph] at our workforce in other parts of Latin America, in other parts of the world, down to Brazil. And that could be things like analytical solutions, decisioning, so on and so forth, fraud products that we have that have worked very well in other parts of the world. That was really the value that the partners saw in us is a good leadership team that understands how to innovate and bring new products from one part of the world to Brazil. So that's exactly what we're doing.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the long-term plan, 3-year horizon, the 7% to 10%, I'm wondering does that assume that you're bringing in some of these minority interest kind of relationships? Or is that -- is the message there that, that is kind of what we are going to see out of the kind of existing structure of the business?","Richard F. Smith","I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say minority interests. You may be thinking of Russia or something like that, but -- that's the existing companies we see today.","Operator","Next up with Credit Suisse, we have George Mihalos.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the OCIS revenue growth. Obviously, you guys have had the 2 large competitive takeaways ramping. Can you give us a sense as to when those contracts will be fully ramped and maybe what their contribution was in this quarter?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. Both of them were -- and Lee, I'm thinking from memory here, both of the ones we referred to, I think it was the last earnings call, should anniversary. It was late third quarter, early fourth quarter of last year. I think one may have been in October and one was maybe just a month or so prior to that. And as far as the contribution of those 2 to the overall growth, I have not done the calculations, my instinct is it's not significant because the growth we're seeing in USCIS is so broad-based, again, across multiple products and almost every single vertical that we play in. So it truly is broad-based and not driven by 1 or 2 takeaways.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. That's good to hear. And just looking at your outlook in 2012 for the TALX business. I think you said you're looking at upper-single-digit revenue growth. Can you talk about your confidence in achieving that number given the sensitivity there to mortgage, and I think you had said that you're kind of forecasting the mortgage business overall being down 20%?","Richard F. Smith","Anytime, and the team is executing very nicely. They had massive headwinds, as we said, last year in the -- starting late second quarter through the fourth quarter, those headwinds have abated. And we have built a plan that's assuming there's 20%-ish decline in the mortgage market, at the end [ph] is diversifying the Work Number well beyond the mortgage markets we talked about. We're increasing the Work Number records, which obviously give them great leverage on the topline and bottom line. We talked about partnerships, we've got to go down market, so I'm highly confident.","Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And last question for me. Just looking at Europe, you guys are looking for a modest recession there. But on a constant currency basis, I mean, you continue to push really strong growth in the European market. Is that really just new products hitting the market, or is there anything more to that that's really driving the outsize growth?","Richard F. Smith","It's largely that. NPI is allowing us to go into new markets that we didn't serve before. It's allowing us to take share with current customers who we are serving. We're leveraging the IXi-like database over to the wealth database to create new products. We think that'll be [ph] Decision 360. So it's really a great execution by the leadership team in the U.K.","Operator","Next up is Bill Warmington with Raymond James.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A question for you on the longer-term revenue guidance framework that you gave. In the past, you've talked -- you've given a little bit more detail in terms of the split there as it breaks down between organic and acquired and then also kind of what's coming from some core growth markets, new products from strategic initiatives and then finally acquisitions as part of that. I just wanted to know if you could...","Richard F. Smith","Great question. You're referring back to the 2000 -- I think '06 timeframe.","Unknown Analyst","Correct.","Richard F. Smith","We don't expect, in that model I just gave you, any improvement from the core market environment, which hopefully, we'll try not to be conservative. We assumed back in -- I think it was '06, '07, '08, 2% or 3%. We're assuming the same here. We assumed back then about 1 to 2 points of M&A. We're assuming the same thing here.  What's really happening is because of our ability to execute the growth initiatives now at a much higher level than where we were when we first launched things like 4G and NPI and so on and so forth. We're stepping that up. And we're going to get more from our core organic growth initiatives, and that will now be 4% to 5%.","William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Rick, you also mentioned adding some resources in sales and marketing. I just wanted to ask in terms of the headcount of sales at the end of 2011 how that compares to the end of 2010 and then where you think it'll be when you exit 2012?","Richard F. Smith","I have no clue. That's an honest answer.  We have -- each business is at a different point in their growth. What you should know is this.  Over last 5 or 6 years, we have invested heavily in the growth levers for the company. So marketing has been a significant investment in new product innovation, product management, pricing segmentation, branding.  Sales is invested heavily now that we're coming out this downturn, but I have no idea what those numbers are by business or in aggregate.","Operator","Dan Leben with Robert W. Baird is next.","Daniel R. Leben - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just wanted to first ask about the online CIS business. Historically, the last 8 or 9 years, the seasonality in that segment's down about $10 million versus the September quarter. Was this quarter primarily just a new customer wins, or has something changed in the underlying seasonal dynamics of that business?","Richard F. Smith","I don't think there's anything changed as far as cyclicality. If I go back to -- it was such a broad-based performance. That's what's different. Every vertical through our NPI initiatives, we're able to grow year-on-year.","Daniel R. Leben - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And if you were -- if you look at those volumes on a same-customer basis, would the same theme be in place?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it's a combination of growing with our current customers and expanding the customers that we serve. And thirdly, even with the customers that we service, not just taking share but solving problems with the data assets, we couldn't solve a [indiscernible] spending more money with us..","Daniel R. Leben - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then with the new regulator now officially up and running, what have you heard from there? And I assume you guys are not the focus for them in the near-term?","Richard F. Smith","We've intentionally reached out to them. We went up and sat down with the team in D.C., which I think it was back in December. I had a very good conversation with them. They've been here to talk our teams. So we're taking a proactive approach with them. And at this juncture, I feel we're well prepared.","Operator","Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus is next.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just want to ask you a little bit about the growth. Everyone's asking about USCIS, but I'm asking a little bit more in terms of comparing to some of your peers that are out there. The growth really exceeds what we're seeing from some of the other competitors. I'm wondering, are you expanding the market, or are you getting a sense that you're -- have or taken market share? And I'm asking just beyond the few competitive takeaway that you guys have highlighted in the last quarter.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it is -- that's a good question. Just a clarification. We are customer-unique data assets able to solve problems for customers that they weren't solving before, so hence, they're spending more money. So it's, I'd say, growing to the pie. Number 2 is we're able to take our products to different verticals we couldn't service as robustly in the past, i.e., insurance, and you take share there or expand the pie. And third, we're clearly taking share from -- existing customers we have, ex share, ex is going up, or taking share where we had no share before from new customers.  A combination.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","To be -- you have a definite sense that you are taking some share from the other existing participants?","Richard F. Smith","Clearly.  And I think I've given you examples over the last year or so. So, absolutely.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in the Consumer financial marketing segment, IXi seems to have been on like on a tear for 1.5 year. And then the last 2 quarters, it slowed down. And is there anything different that's been going on in IXi? Is it really that they had a really high level of project or related work over there? Can you just give us a little more clarity?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I think 2 things. And, Lee, jump in. One was last -- towards the end of last year, especially the fourth quarter of 2010, I should say, not 2011, they had an unbelievable run-up of some project-based work that did not repeat. So the comps were tough, and they had a couple of large projects, as Lee mentioned in his commentary, that were viewed on the label discretionary spend that did not materialize. The underlying growth of the company, the value proposition of the product for the customers is still strong.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So it really is project -- tough comps and project work that for some reason is just slowing down right now.","Richard F. Smith","Correct.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, on the Commercial Solutions. Again, you had a very, very strong string of quarters in terms of year-over-year growth. And then this quarter was fine but not like the double-digit growth. Was there some deferrals that ended up happening that are slipping into 1Q that are just going to make that a particularly strong quarter?","Richard F. Smith","If you look at the core U.S. risk business, which is the core of that BU -- I forgot the number, strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter. And much like IXi, they have a piece of the business we call NDM [ph], which is the marketing, which is a project-based business that is somewhat discretionary. And it was that piece of business in the fourth quarter that didn't pop like we had hoped it would pop. But if you go back to my commentary, I think in my concluding comments, I talked about the forecast for 2012, first quarter and total year, and I told you I expect good, strong double-digit growth from that.","Richard Cheever","Okay. And so we're not seeing -- you're not -- that's not indicative of any slowdown in the core markets that you're serving right now?","Richard F. Smith","No, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their participation. We'll be around throughout the day if there's any additional questions. And with that, operator, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.","Operator","Once again, everyone, that will conclude today's call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect. Please enjoy the rest of your day."],"8698":["Equifax Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dodge","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today\u2019s conference call. I\u2019m Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section of the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned the reporting structure of our direct-to-consumer reseller business, so that it now reports into our Personal Solutions business. Previously, direct-to-consumer resellers were reported within the USIS and International segments, based on the country of the customer. We have provided the quarterly history for Personal Solutions, USIS and International in the new format for each quarter in 2014 and 2015 in the Q&A section of our earnings release. All discussion of the 2015 business unit performance and their outlook for 2016 will be consistent with the new structure.","Earlier this week, the Veda shareholders voted to accept Equifax\u2019s acquisition offer, and we also received subsequent approval from court. Therefore, the 2016 guidance provided today as well as the updated long-term business model for Equifax which is included in the Q&A section of our earnings release both include the impact of the Veda acquisition. However, our for the first quarter of 2016 will not include any impact from Veda including the incremental cost of the debt, given the short amount of time Veda will be part of Equifax in the quarter.","During this call, as in previous earnings releases, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted operating margin, which will be adjusted for certain items, which affect comparability of the underlying operational performance. In 2016, we will be emphasizing adjusted EBITDA margin in discussing our operational performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income, adding back depreciation, amortization and the impact of certain one-time items, including the acquisition and integration expenses from Veda, which are also reflected in our calculation of adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables posted on our website.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2014 Form 10-K and the subsequent filings. Please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Thanks as always for joining us this morning. Execution across all four of our business units continues to be very strong and enabled us to deliver yet another strong quarter in the fourth quarter as well as full year.","For the quarter, fourth quarter 2015, total revenue was $666 million, up 7% on reported basis and up 10% on a local currency basis from 2014. For the quarter, FX created $18 million of year-over-year headwind for us. The adjusted operating margin was 27.1%, up from 26.5% in the fourth quarter 2014. Adjusted EPS was $1.14, up 12% from $1.02 in 2014. And just to refresh your memory that exceeded the upper end of our guidance range we provided on the last call, which is $1.10 to $1.12.","Finally, given our strong performance in 2015, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend, up to now $0.33 a quarter. And this is as you probably all know the sixth consecutive double-digit increase in our dividend rate, reflecting the strong performance of the Company.","I think you\u2019ll agree on many dimensions, 2015 was an outstanding year for our 117-year old business. And we exceeded our expectations; we have broad-based contributions from each business unit; investor verticals and across the vast majority of our geographies, our tem delivered. We\u2019re well-positioned for strong 2016. We\u2019ll talk about the economic environment in the Q&A. And I\u2019m proud of the team for their continued commitment to innovation, execution, outstanding customer service.","For the full year, total revenue was $2.7 billion, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on a local currency basis from 2014 and for the year FX created a $76 million year-over-year headwind. Adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 90 basis points from 26.5% in 2014, well above the targeted 25 basis points or so increase we guided to in the past. Adjusted EPS was $4.50, up 16% from $3.89 a year ago and just as a reminder that performance in 2015 was all organically driven, as we had no acquisitions in the year.","As I always do, I\u2019ll transition to the business units for some brief commentary before John gives you the details. I\u2019ll go through some highlights for the business as well and then we\u2019ll get into more specifics. So, I want to talk first of all, Jeff mentioned in his opening comments, we repositioned PSOL in 2015. You know that this team has been working diligently on our new growth model, which I fully support and it\u2019s yielding benefits. And John will go through some of those numbers.","At the same time, I made the decision -- it was important that we have one tem, one leader, one business that would manage our strategy, our product position in the geographies for our consumer business regardless of that business going direct to the consumer or is going through a reseller. So, we made the decision to realign that under Dann Adams who leads our direct-to-consumer businesses globally. I think that this gives us more continuity going forward.","Now, on to the businesses themselves: USIS delivered an impressive 8% revenue growth for the year while expanding its operating margins 290 basis points. Our insights driven strategy, which we talked about, has resonated extremely well for largest clients in our Key Client Program. Our KCP customers are purchasing multiple Decision 360 products and services, in aggregate access almost five Equifax data products, which is remarkable.","Across our top 100 clients, Decisions 360 products and services are increasing as well, and there they are accessing about three products on average. So, D360 is really making a difference in the marketplace for us.","And USIS, our fraud and identity management solutions business, again delivered healthy 22% growth for the year, largely driven by their ID authentication and management solution products. Our enterprise vertical strategy has made significant contributions to our total Company revenue growth. With experienced industry executives in these verticals, we are better able to leverage our diverse data assets, analytic expertise and IT platforms to deliver premier decision solutions.","USIS leads many of our enterprise vertical initiatives. To give you an example of few of those; in 2015, our mortgage vertical grew 25% and USIS at 29% for the total Company. This again compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 17% for the year. So, a trend of outperforming the mortgage market has continued now for many, many years. Next example is in the auto vertical, which USIS revenue grew 6% and total Company grew 9%. This also compares very favorably to the overall market where vehicle sales were up approximately 5%.","And more recently, our retail banking vertical grew USIS revenue 17% and total Company revenue by 18%. So, you get a sense that with this enterprise focus, taking all of the great assets, getting seasoned leaders in these verticals, delivering those unique assets to our customers is enabling us to grow significantly in many cases, faster than market itself.","For years now, we\u2019ve been working with Fannie Mae on ways to better leverage our information to further improve the underlying process for mortgage loans. Late in 2015, Fannie Mae made the decision to incorporate credit data into the underwriting process for mortgage lending. We talked about this with you in the past. This initiative will be an important contributor to revenue in both 2016 and 2017. But it also represents a significant structural change in the loan underwriting, as this sets the stage for applications outside the mortgage lending to increasingly use trended data and our world-class and local talent, and leverage our Cambrian platform, which we talked about before.","We are well-positioned to take advantage of those opportunities as they arrive. Live testing is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2016 and go live mid-year. More importantly, trended data will be available to our core credit online delivery system, making the information available for all solutions that access our credit database.","Opportunities for USIS in 2016 and beyond are significant. Trended data, ID and fraud, further penetration with targeted vertical markets are all expected to make important contributions to sustained revenue growth.","A multiyear model for USIS remains as we\u2019ve communicated to you before with top-line growth in the 5% to 7% range and adjusted EBITDA margin which will now talk about, going forward, is expected to be in a high 40s, expanding to low fifties over time.","International delivered 12%, local currency revenue growth with strong performance coming from our operations in Europe and Latin America. Revenue in International\u2019s three largest verticals FIs, telcos, and small and medium sized enterprises, grew 13% in 2015. Our decision platforms, analytics solutions and debt management revenue grew 12% in 2015. Europe had an outstanding year, driven largely by broad-based growth in our UK operations.","By industry, FIs; telco; SMEs, all grew high to low double-digits for the year. And our decision solutions, analytical services and debt management all grew at double-digit rates in 2015. TDX has been working, as you know, with UK government to manage their past due consumer debt in -- fourth quarter 2015 and started receiving accounts at that time and started placing those accounts with the collection agencies, analyzing the data in the fourth quarter of last year. And while still early, the performance to-date is slightly ahead of our expectations, this opportunity along with our ongoing sales efforts is expected to be a significant strategic initiative, driving growth for International for years to come.","Internal has historically delivered some of our strongest performance in new product innovation, which has been a significant contributor to incremental revenue growth for the market penetration and obviously customer loyalty because we\u2019re building new products and solutions that we couldn\u2019t build in past. This broad-based effort towards innovation continues to fuel growth for International.","For the year, six geographies in International represented almost two-thirds of the revenue delivered in NPI Vitality Index of 10% or greater, which is fabulous. International has some exciting opportunities ahead of us, in addition to Veda, which I\u2019ll come back to talk about later, which will become a part of the International operation. In 2016, we\u2019ll broadly expand Cambrian, deploying it across the international geographies, substantially enhancing our ability to deliver analytical insights and drive growth. The continued excellent performance with new products and cost benefits and the regionalization efforts begun last year, as well as the addition to Veda, will expand EBITDA margins in 2016 and beyond. We have moderately raised our expectations for multiyear growth in international now to a range of 7% -- or 8% to 10% with adjusted EBITDA margins in the low-30s going to mid-30s over time. Both those measures of top-line and EBITDA margins reflect the anticipated close of Veda.","On the Workforce Solutions, they grew 18%; last year was an outstanding performance as was their 510 basis-point margin expansion for the year. Core product growth along with a number of new product initiatives all contributed to this outstanding performance.","Verification Services\u2019 strong and broad-based growth of 25% in the year continues to be driven by adding records of The Work Number database. As our coverage of individual employment records increases, the value of our services enables us to fully penetrate our key target verticals including mortgage, auto, consumer finance, government and pre-employment. And all those verticals, every one of them was up a very strong double-digit for the year, just amazingly strong balance growth. At year-end The Work Number database reached almost 280 million records. And as we stated before, we\u2019re well on our way to achieving 300 million records in total.","The recent emergence of what they call, the instant mortgage, facilitated through online application process is generating new growth opportunities for automated income and employment verification. We recently signed one of the largest players in the space, because of our unique ability to deliver both, the credit information as well as the employment and income verification simultaneously, speeding up the process and enhancing the consumer experience.","Within EWS, the Employer Services business also had another very strong year in 2015, growing 8%. Much of this growth was driven by our workforce analytics offering which we\u2019ve talked to you about before. This allows employers to ensure that they\u2019re complaint with the Affordable Care Act, as well as providing ACA required tax information to employees.","Workforce analytics doubled the business in 2015 and is expected to more than double again in 2016. Our workforce analytics client-base now is approaching over 800 clients and the pipeline remains very strong. To-date, our solution\u2019s largely been focused on our larger enterprise customers; in 2016, we are starting to go down market, enabling us to capture relationships with smaller employees, which we can offer cross-sell opportunities with our other employee services offerings.","Healthcare related revenue generated by both our income verification and the Affordable Care Act compliant solutions more than doubled in 2015 versus 2014. Our Workforce Solutions has delivered a stellar performance, not just in 2015 but over the last nine years. As a business, they were quick to adopt our approach to innovate and to embrace LEAN. As a result, they\u2019ve outperformed on revenue growth and substantial improved their margin.","Looking forward, expanding and further penetrating the key markets and verticals, increasing the number of records and number of database and globalizing the footprint, will continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Our multiyear expectation for Workforce Solutions has been increased, now expecting revenue growth of 9% to 11% with adjusted EBITDA margin in the high-40% range, expanding to low-50s over time.","Personal Solutions finalized its strategic transformation and is executing well against its four-pronged strategy for the year and newly constructed global person solutions with over 19% local currency growth -- revenue growth and is well-positioned for 2016 and beyond. Revenue growth from our direct and indirect consumer activities continues to meet our expectations. Revenue growth in our Personal Solutions business in Canada and UK was up a nice 7% in 2015. In the U.S., we continue to perform consistent with our expectations with increasing ARPU and lowering subscriber churn.","Our direct-to-consumer resellers were the most significant contributor to Personal Solutions in 2015. We talked about that when it was a part of USIS. Our reseller revenues in both Canada and UK grew solid as well, solid double-digit in fact in 2015. And the reseller revenue in the U.S. was very strong, primarily driven by the two-year contract with a leading company in the space, Credit Karma, and we\u2019ve talked to you about that; also well-positioned for continued growth in 2016. You may have seen the addition of a new reseller LifeLock, we signed a multiyear contract a few months back.","With our broad-based portfolio of data assets, we believe there will be additional opportunities in 2016 and beyond to provide a broader array of credit, income and fraud services to consumers who are direct in reseller channel.","Under the new organizational structure, our multiyear expectations for revenue growth in PSOL is now 5% to 8%, up from the previous target of 4% to 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the low 30s, expanding to the mid 30s over time. The outsized growth in 2015 was primarily driven by the startup of our relationship Credit Karma, the largest of our DTC, direct-to-consumer resellers. In 2016, we\u2019ll anniversary this revenue. So, long-term growth rates for PSOL revert back to more normal levels again of 5% to 8% with strong growth going forward.","Now, on to some corporate highlights before I turn the mic over to John to give you more details on the financials. Today, -- we are truly a globally company with a global set of processes deployed around the world, a global structure, a global culture and a group that\u2019s all focused on a core set of global strategic imperatives. Over the years, we\u2019ve globalized our most critical and fundamental management disciplines, to facilitate greater linkage between our strategy and our execution; and through this effort, we have streamlined our product innovation and placement. We\u2019ve been able to grow the leverage of our IT platforms; we\u2019ve optimized the investment in our talent and we more effectively moved our talent and products where the greatest opportunities exist.","This globalization also enables us to better and more quickly leverage the skills and expertise developed in one market i.e. in USIS, into another market, international; again that\u2019s both, processes, products and people. Everybody in the Company is measured and evaluated in what they contribute to our imperatives, regardless of what part of the organization they reside. Having reinvigorated our NPI, new product innovation where we talked to you about last year of our 2.0 kind of next phase of innovation. We\u2019ve launched 64 new products last year. Along with the pipeline of 2016 launches, we expect the revenue contributions to deliver strong NPI growth in 2016 and beyond.","Our largest and most diverse growth opportunities are executed under our enterprise growth initiatives, we call it EGI. In 2015, year-over-year revenue growth from these large initiatives was over 20% -- 20% growth over 2014. In 2015, we exceeded our expectations for NPI revenues by 6%. Furthermore, as discussed with you in the past, the class of products we launched in 2015 under our revitalized effort of 2.0, are expected to delivery record level of revenue -- year three revenue when compared to prior year launch. It is the healthiest class of products that we\u2019ve launched since NPI has been in existence here.","One of the more exciting new product opportunities revolves around trended data. The effort and investment we are making to fulfill our commitment to Fannie Mae will be leveraged across all of our unique data assets. We firmly believe that the next horizon for information-based solution is trended data, which will underpin more powerful decision solutions for our customers and significantly improve our competitive position. So, to be clear, our focus is trending as many of our unique data assets which are truly unique only to Equifax or customers provide these values, so things like The Work Number, NC+ and others. ","Finally, as with many of our corporate management documents, our global NPI process will be implemented in Veda, once we complete the acquisition. And I\u2019ll get to Veda in a moment.","In 2015, we launched our big data platform called Cambrian. Cambrian will enable fashion development and delivery of analytic insights like including improving the speed at which we develop new products. It will also greatly enhance our Decision 360 capabilities and provide significant competitive advantage using advanced analytic techniques.","Other corporate imperative for us has been around LEAN. LEAN continues to make incremental contributions to our expense leverage and exceeded our goal, contributing over 30% greater benefit in 2015 than we had budgeted. And we leveraged our expertise in LEAN principles to deepen our relationships with some of our largest customers with projects that helped streamline many of their operational activities. And that obviously provides a competitive differentiated solution to the marketplace.","Let me close before I give it to John and talk a little bit about Veda. I am sure many of you are aware that the regulatory approval Veda received in December, enabling to schedule the shareholder meeting, which Jeff alluded to a little bit ago. They had the shareholder meeting on February 8th and gained approval there, and they\u2019ve also received the final court approval this week. And at this point, it is our expectation to close the acquisition towards the end of February of this year. We\u2019re very excited about this opportunity. It represents for us the great strategies, strong financial performance, outstanding management team, great market position, and it also gives us a significant opportunity in Asia-Pacific geography to further broaden and enhancing our geographic footprint, which is important to us as we diversify our revenue stream. As we move into our first quarter earnings call and beyond, obviously we\u2019ll keep you apprised of the strategic and the financial progress that the team is making with this new asset.","In closing, our performance in 2015 exemplifies the culture and strength of our management team and our dedication, the entire organization to innovate and execute for our customers. It\u2019s a culture and the process that has taken years to develop. And it underpins the confidence we have in our ability to continue to delivering on our commitments and to make our customers and shareholders satisfy with their performance.","Our strategic imperatives, as we enter 2016 are in a few areas that that are very important to us; we cascade these around the world, one obviously is deliver strong and consistent profitable growth and shareholder returns; two, to develop unparalleled analytical insights, leveraging the unique data assets that Equifax has; three is innovate from market leadership in the key domains and verticals in which we operate; four, is to serve as a trusted steward and advocate for customers and consumers around the world; and obviously in closing, the last, to invest in talent to drive that strategy and foster the culture of innovation.","So with that John, as you always do, pleased take us through the financials.","John Gamble","Thanks Rick and good morning. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. Now, let me turn to the business units\u2019 financial performance for the fourth quarter. As Jeff mentioned at the opening, all BU information is based on the new segments with direct-to-consumer resellers moved to PSOL from USIS and International. Going forward, given the substantial amortization expense related to the Veda acquisition, we will increase our discussion of EBITDA for Equifax and the operating segments.","U.S. Information Solutions revenue in 4Q \u201815 was $296 million, up 7% when compared to the fourth quarter of \u201814. For the full year, revenue of $1.2 billion was up 8%. This compares favorably to our long-term expectation for USIS of 5% to 7% growth as both mortgage and automotive were very strong in 2015.","Online Information Solutions revenue was $204 million in 4Q \u201815, up 6% year-to-year and $842 million for the full year, up 8% when compared to the prior year. Mortgage Solutions revenue was $28 million in 4Q \u201815, up 10% year-to-year and $124 million for calendar year \u201815, up 17%. Total mortgage related revenue was up 16% and 17% in the quarter for USIS and Equifax, respectively. For calendar year \u201815, mortgage-related revenue was up 25% and 29% for USIS and Equifax, respectively. This compares favorably to the average Mortgage Bankers Application Index, which was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the calendar year.","Financial Marketing Services revenue was $64 million in 4Q \u201815, up 7% year-to-year and up $205 million for calendar year \u201815, up 5% year-to-year. The operating margin for U.S. Information Solutions was 41.6% in 4Q \u201815 and 41.9% for calendar year \u201815, up 50 basis points and 290 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 4Q \u201815 and 49.7% in calendar year \u201815. We expect to see continued expansion in USIS EBITDA margins in 2016.","International\u2019s revenue was $143 million in 4Q \u201815, down 1% on a reported basis, but up 11% on a local currency basis. Revenue was $569 million for calendar year \u201815, down 1% on reported basis, but up 12% on a local currency basis. By region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $64 million in 4Q \u201815, up 3% in U.S. dollars and up 10% in local currency. For calendar year \u201815, Europe revenue was $247 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency.","Latin America\u2019s revenue was $49 million in 4Q \u201815, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. Revenue was $200 million for calendar year \u201815, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currency. Latin America showed outstanding local currency growth throughout \u201815, led by strong growth across Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.","Canada revenue was $29 million, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 5% in local currency. Revenue for calendar year \u201815 was $122 million in U.S. dollars, down 11% in U.S. dollars but up 3% in local currency. Canada\u2019s performance strengthened very nicely in the second half and has momentum going into 2016.","International\u2019s operating margin was 20.7% in 4Q \u201815 and 20% in calendar year \u201815. EBITDA margins were 27.2% in 4Q \u201815 and 27% in calendar year \u201815. Both operating and EBITDA margins were down year-to-year in International. However, both showed sequential improvement in the fourth quarter relative to third. In 2016, we expect to see continued margin improvement driven by continued strong local currency growth and the benefits of regionalization as well as from the addition of Veda. We\u2019ll see some margin pressure related to weakened foreign currencies, particularly with the Canadian dollar and the devaluation of the Argentine peso.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $144 million in the quarter, up 12% year-to-year and $578 million in calendar year \u201815, up 18% year-to-year. This reflects continued very strong growth in verification services, up 14% in fourth quarter and 25% year-to-year. Employer Services also delivered a very strong performance, up 8% in the fourth quarter and 8% in the calendar year. This was driven by success in their Compliance Center and offerings and their solution for employer\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the ACA. The Workforce Solutions\u2019 operating margin was 36.8% in 4Q, \u201815 and 37.9% in calendar \u201815, up 430 and 510 basis points respectively. Workforce Solutions EBITDA margins were 44.3% in the fourth quarter and 45.1% in the calendar year. We expect continued strong expansion in Workforce Solutions\u2019 EBITDA margins in 2016.","Global Personal Solutions revenue was $84 million in 4Q \u201815, up 12% on a reported basis and up 14% on local currency basis. Revenue in Calendar year \u201815 was $346 million, up 18% on reported basis and up 19% on a local currency basis.","PSOL\u2019s business has two main areas, credit and identity monitoring services sold through direct and indirect channels that protect and monitor consumer\u2019s ID and enable consumers to gain better access to credit, and credit another data sales sold through our DTC reseller partners.","Credit and identity monitoring services sold through the indirect channel represent those circumstances where Equifax provides white label, online credit and identity service through partners. In 2015, ongoing revenue from credit and identity monitoring services grew at the high end of the 4% to 6% guidance range we have previously provided for the PSOL segment, prior to the addition of DTC resellers. DTC resellers\u2019 revenue represents sales of credit and other data to resellers. In these cases, Equifax provides data and analytics but not the web properties with which the customer directly interacts. Examples of this business are our relationships with Credit Karma and LifeLock. DTC reseller revenue showed substantial growth in 2015, driven primarily by our relationship with Credit Karma, which began in 4Q \u201814.","Our DTC reseller revenue should continue to grow faster than our direct-to-consumer sales but as Rick mentioned, not at the very high rate we saw in 2015. Looking forward, as previously mentioned, we expect this overall segment to grow 5% to 8%.","Operating margin was 27% in 4Q \u201815 and 27.5% for calendar year \u201815, consistent with our expectations. EBITDA margins were 29.7% in 4Q \u201815 and 30.2% in calendar year \u201815. PSOL revenue and operating margin in 4Q \u201814, were very strong, reflecting a large rich deal won in 4Q \u201814. 4Q \u201815 operating margin of 27% was consistent with our expectations and our guidance, and reflects the impact of our decision to invest more in marketing in 2015 as well as the addition of DTC reseller business to PSOL.","In the fourth quarter, general corporate expense was $51 million excluding $3.7 million of onetime expenses associated with the Veda acquisition. General corporate expense was up slightly from 3Q consistent with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect general corporate expense excluding Veda related acquisition and integration expenses to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million and run at a slightly lower rate throughout the remaining quarters of the year. The adjusted operating margin at 27.1% in 4Q \u201815 and 27.4% in calendar year \u201815 were up 60 and 90 basis points year-to-year respectively.","Adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.4% in 4Q \u201815 and 34.8% in calendar year \u201815. We expect to see improvements in our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2016 expanding by about 75 basis points.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.6%, equal to our expectation and in our guidance. For the full year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate after adjusting for non-GAAP items, the Missouri State tax law change in the second quarter and the TDX escrow adjustment in the third quarter was 33.7%, consistent with our comments during our third quarter release. Looking forward into 2016, our expectation is for a GAAP effective tax rate of about 33%.","Operating cash flow was $205 million in 4Q \u201815 and $742 million in calendar year \u201815, both were very strong reflecting strong earnings and working capital performance. Free cash flow equal to operating cash flow less capital expenditures was very strong in 2015 at $596 million, up 12% from 2014.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $53 million and for calendar year \u201815 were $146 million. Consistent with our comments throughout the year, the increase in capital spending versus 2014 reflects the acceleration of our investment in new product innovation, deployment of global platforms including Cambrian and other analytics, InterConnect, fraud and our new PSOL infrastructure.","As we look forward to 2016, we expect capital spending including Veda to be in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. This is consistent with 2015 and reflects a continuation of our current investments as well as some additional spending in the near-term as we integrate Veda. This is slightly higher than our expected long-term rate of capital spending of about 5% of revenue due to the Veda integration.","As Rick indicted, we have received Veda shareholder approval and approval from the Australian court to complete the purchase of data. We expect the acquisition to close on about February 25th. Total purchase price including assumed debt and fees is approximately U.S. $1.9 billion. At the close of the Veda transaction, we will have debt outstanding of just under $3.1 billion and debt-to-EBITDA on the trailing basis of just under three times.","As indicated previously, we expect to maintain our current credit ratings. In 2016, we will focus on using our very strong cash flow for debt reduction and returning our leverage to a level consistent with our current credit ratings. Therefore, we do not intend to repurchase shares in 2016. We will however continue with acquisitions beyond Veda in 2016 with the goal of delivering on our long-term model of an additional one to two points of revenue growth. Assuming acquisitions consistent with our targets in 2016 and 2017, we would expect to repurchase shares in 2017.","As we discussed last quarter, we will exclude Veda transaction and other acquisition expenses and integration expenses incurred in the first year after the Veda acquisition through 1Q \u201817 in calculating adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margin. We will provide information regarding transaction and acquisition expenses incurred with the acquisition as well as integration expenses we expect to incur related to the Veda acquisition after the transaction closes at our 1Q \u201816 earnings release conference call.","Also, Jeff mentioned at the beginning of the call, given the relatively short time we will own Veda in the quarter, our 1Q \u201816 guidance does not include the impact of Veda, nor the incremental debt costs, including interest expense related to the acquisition. We will provide you details on the impact of Veda on 1Q \u201816 during our 1Q \u201816 earnings call in April.","The 2016 full year guidance Rick will provide includes Veda. For 2016, we have assumed Veda will be a part of Equifax for 10 months. Veda revenue for the 10 months is assumed to be U.S. $220 million to $230 million. This includes an estimate of the impact to revenue of U.S. GAAP, which will be updated as we close 1Q \u201816. The benefit to adjusted EPS from Veda, net of acquisition financing cost is about $0.10 to $0.15 per share. As a reminder, adjusted EPS excludes acquisition amortization expense. For modeling purposes, you can assume an average cost of our Veda acquisition debt during 2016 of about 2.5%. Veda\u2019s seasonality of revenue is similar to Equifax with 2Q revenue typically the highest from the seasonality perspective; 1Q generally the lowest revenue; and 3Q and 4Q somewhat similar in terms of revenue. The spread between 2Q and 1Q revenue has recently been in the range of 7% to 10%.","Now, let me turn it back to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks John. Some summary comments before we go to the Q&A.","As I have mentioned before to all of you and as many of you had noted in our conversations in the write-ups, the level of execution and the momentum that this team has generated in 2015 is the best in my 10 years here. So, I think it is truly remarkable what they have done.","We are well-positioned for growth opportunities that lie ahead and our ability to take on any of the challenges that may confront us. In coming years, the revenue going to be contributed from the class of new products that we just launched and expected to exceed our historical leverage that there is wind at our back.","Our enterprise growth initiatives including expanding insights driven Cambrian, healthcare, trended data, and auto will not only enhance our competitive position but also deliver growth opportunities for years to come. All of these efforts are expected in our opinion to offset the rate anticipated slowdown of U.S. mortgage market, which as you know started to decelerate over the course of 2015. While it\u2019s impossible to predict where the mortgage market is going go, especially when I looked this morning, the ten-year treasury is under 1.6. Forecast range from down 20% to up mid single-digits. Our forecast that we\u2019ve given you for 2016 is anticipating that the mortgage market will be down single-digits in 2016. And obviously, our expectation is that team in both Workforce Solutions and USIS, as they have done for many, many years, outperforms that quite significantly. Obviously if rates continue to stay low as they are, there may be some market upside to what occurs in the mortgage market, and we\u2019ll know obviously as we head deeper into the year.","2016 is yet again expected to be another strong year of performance for the Company. For the year, we expect revenue including the impact of Veda to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth of 15% to 19% that\u2019s going to be partially offset by about 2 to 3 points of FX headwind. This is consistent with our comments in October that the organic constant currency growth would be at the high end of our long-term range of 6% to 8%. I\u2019ve got to say it again that\u2019s the high end of the range coming off of constant currency growth last year of 12%. So, it\u2019s I think quite remarkable.","As John mentioned, we also expect to add another 1 to 2-point of tuck-in acquisitions throughout the year. These additional acquisitions are obviously beyond Veda, which as he said is not including in the first quarter of 2016 outlook. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $4.95 and $5.05 which is up 10% to 12% for the year. Excluding approximately $0.13 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 14% to 15%. For the first quarter, we expect organic revenue to be between $685 million and $695 million, reflecting constant currency organic revenue growth of 8% to 10% to be partially offset by about 3 points of FX headwind in the quarter.","First quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.14 and $1.16, which is up 7% to 8%. Excluding $0.04 per share of negative impact from FX, this reflects constant currency organic EPS growth of 10% to 12% for the first quarter. Again, we expect to close Veda in the first quarter, but we\u2019re not including it in the estimate. Maybe during Q&A we\u2019ll talk about why it\u2019s going to push forward [ph] for that one month.","In 2016, we are also going to shift our focus to adjusted EBITDA margin that we talk about that throughout the call since it better represents the true operating performing of the Company. 2016, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by solid 75 basis points over last year\u2019s 34.8% EBITDA margin. In our modified multiyear business model, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the upper 30% to 40% range with annual acceleration of at least 25 basis points.","So, with that operator, if you\u2019d open it up for questions for audience, it\u2019d be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thank you. Good morning, Rick and John; and congrats on the strong results. Rick, could you give us your outlook for the health of the consumer by major geographies served? Given some of the trends we\u2019re seeing globally, do you think the consumer will hold up?","Rick Smith","Dave, that\u2019s a great question obviously with the volatility we\u2019ve seen in the first five or six weeks of 2016. John and I spend a lot of time with our teams talking about that. I can\u2019t at this juncture draw a connection between equity market volatility and the health of the consumer in our major markets around the world. As you know, we operate in about 19 different countries and have a great pulse on what\u2019s going on with customer, many cases on a daily basis across different verticals, different industry sectors and combined that with some very smart people internally and externally we leverage on a routine basis, economists that help us think through consumer small business lending trends.","And we are not see a slowdown in our markets, maybe exception here or there but nothing material David that gives me concern that the forecast we just gave you for guidance is not very attainable. We\u2019re just not seen that strong correlation. So, at this juncture in our major markets around the world, the consumers continue to be healthy. We described it, I think it was a few quarters ago is in a sweet spot, we still believe that and feel it and we see it in our numbers.","David Togut","Great, thank you. And then could you talk about operating leverage for 2016? Most of your margin comments were more mid to long-term which were very helpful. But, we saw Workforce Solutions\u2019 margin up in the fourth quarter, for example 430 basis points. So, how should we think about sort of margin profile by business segment for this year?","Rick Smith","Let me give you the aggregate, and I\u2019ll ask John to go to the details. But, I did guide at the very end about 75 basis -- we\u2019re talking EBITDA now David. 75 basis points of margin expansion at the corporate level 2016 over 2015, what you can see there is continued margin expansion in businesses that have been expanding now for quite some time that EWS as you alluded and USIS that trend will continue. Number two, we intentionally made investments in PSOL in 2015, positioning them for better growth in 2016 and beyond. That\u2019s kind of the highest now. So, you\u2019ll start to see margin expansion in PSOL from levels you saw in 2015. We also invested in two main areas in International that are behind us now, one was as you\u2019re very aware of, standing up of the UK government contract, which was a yearlong having investments and now the revenue starts to come, because it was virtually no revenue in 2015.","Secondly, we talked about kind of regionalization of platforms and people and processes to give us a long-term more cost efficient international model. Those investments were largely made in 2015; those have now been anniversaried. So, you\u2019ll start to see International and PSOL margins expanding this year and obviously International I alluded to, will be -- also their margins will be enhanced with the addition of a very high margin successful business in Veda. Beyond that, do you have any other\u2026 ","John Gamble","Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add is compliance and security expenses continued to tremendous growth in 2014, 2015, still more substantial investment in \u201816, but we do expect over time those are going to moderate in terms of the increases, although still be substantial. So, we should see some accretion over time related to the moderation of those curves.","Rick Smith","I\u2019ll make a statement here, John, correct me if I am wrong, David, to give you a little more texture, maybe to what you\u2019re looking for. If you look at each individual BU and you look sequentially, \u201816 versus \u201815 every BU\u2019s EBITDA margin will go up from 2015 and 2016\u2019s expectation.","John Gamble","You\u2019ll see much larger expansion in the USIS and EWS, as you\u2019ve seen over the past several years; should see some across PSOL and International; and then overall, we will expand, because you\u2019re just not going to see the degradation from the last two.","David Togut","That\u2019s very helpful, thanks. Just a quick final question. Rick, you called out 280 million Work Number records, which is up pretty substantially. Can you give us a sense of how you\u2019re thinking of the growth of this business, particularly as The Work Number records increase, are seeing a much greater hit rate on searches by clients?","Rick Smith","David, I think this business -- all four businesses are executing high and have great growth opportunities. These guys are in early stages of the growth opportunities. It\u2019s not only going to 280 to 300 increase, hit rate, as you mentioned; it\u2019s also -- we are so early and I gave you some sense of the growth rates by verticals. And it\u2019s amazing; these are very, very high double-digit growth rates in the verification side. We\u2019re such -- we are so rightly penetrated in many of the high growth markets; there are years of growth to go on the verification side in the U.S. alone. Let me add to that which is not the heart of your question, growth from the analytics platform that we\u2019ve built on the employer side. And I gave a little comment, which I didn\u2019t expand upon but I will now, in my prepared comments David. The appetite for customers in geographies around the world for us to take this platform of The Work Number to their geographies is stronger now than it\u2019s ever been. And we have got a team working full speed, couple of main geographies around the world, so I\u2019m not going to get involved in detail on where but to solve the same problems that we are solving here, there. So, long way of saying the growth opportunity is significant, it\u2019s multiyear and it\u2019s not just the U.S.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio","Hey Rick, just couple of questions on the trended data. I was just wondering first, if you want to -- probably too sensitive but if you want to talk about maybe the price premium or the ASP for trended data versus credit snapshot. Also wanted to know what percentage of mortgages currently use or kind of pull The Work Number and where you think that\u2019s going to be at sort of -- what is this currently; what could be it at year-end and maybe what you think could be out two to three years from now? Thank you.","Rick Smith","Thanks Paul. Yes, your comments were right; I am not going to the level of pricing increase we get from trended data. But the way to look at it is the value derived on an ROI basis from the mortgage underwriters from looking at data over multiple years versus a short time, is significant, as a result of willing to pay more for trended data. The other point I alluded to in my prepared comments, Paul, was we are going trend more than just the credit file and take our really unique data assets that no one else has and start trending those. Think about the value of trending income data versus taking a snapshot in time, and then you take the utility data. So, the trending -- I really mean this is sort of the trending of data especially the unique data assets we have I think creates innovative products and solutions for the years to come.","As far as the mortgage market on Workforce Solutions, again, we don\u2019t disclose that level of detail. I\u2019ll leave it at this though there is still significant room. And David Togut kind of alluded this. At the database grows, the hit rate goes up; it benefits all verticals including mortgage but we still have penetration opportunities, not just on hit rate but by account in the mortgage arena in EWS, much like we do in auto, insurance, credit card, government, and others for The Work Number.","Paul Ginocchio","If I could just ask a follow-up, I think you left guidance for USIS relatively stable under the new system versus the old. I am just wondering with the opportunity the trended presents to you, why would you have kind of not set up a little bit?","Rick Smith","There is a couple of things, one is short term, as we look at \u201816 and then I\u2019ll go to multiyear, two. For \u201816, there is one primary thing going on there. You\u2019ve got significant headwinds, specifically in the first half of the year in USIS for mortgage. Mortgage\u2019s biggest quarters were the first and second quarter and as we said before, it starts to decelerate in second half. So, that\u2019s why I left that model consistent for \u201816 Paul. In fact I think, it would be at the lower end of that range in \u201816, to be very clear with you. And then as far as the multiyear model, I\u2019d not ratchet [ph] that up; I\u2019d rather do that once I have success under our belt and we see just how big this is going to be. So, I think it\u2019s a little premature business. But at the right time, once we see the success and traction, as you know there is lives in mid-year and will be a lot smarter at the end of the year and if model justifies being changed at that time, we will.","Paul Ginocchio","Great. Thanks Rick and congratulations on the Social Security Administration contract. If I could just really quickly ask for the my online social security accounts, how many times a year do you think they\u2019ll verify each of those 22 million accounts on average? Thanks.","Rick Smith","Great question, I have no idea.","Paul Ginocchio","Okay.","Rick Smith","Good question, Paul.","Paul Ginocchio","Thanks.","Rick Smith","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Yes, good morning gentlemen. Rick, nice to hear, as always, a lot of progress, but it sounds like at least with all of your initiatives, you guys have taken that up one notch like level there. And I think you still have your NPI target of 10%; I know I have asked this many times before. It doesn\u2019t sound like you need to motivate people by taking it up, but at what point do you do sort of push yourselves even further to the target up?","Rick Smith","I think of it this way, I did mention that the revitalization in NPI that we launched in late \u201814 benefited in the \u201815 class, one of the strongest classes ever and that bode will well for next three years. So, it\u2019s moving in the right direction. Two, you always have, as you think about the vitality index, Manav, you get big chunks of product roll off every once in a while. So, making up big chunks of products is harder than it sounds, just to stay at 10%. But three, maybe most importantly, you\u2019ve heard us now talk for about two years around EGI. It\u2019s not about innovation it is taking large complicated growth initiatives across multiple geographies and making sure we sustain the kind of growth we need there. And that was I think 20% growth I alluded to in my earnings call. So look at it totally, and the contributions from NPI and EGI, it is significant. So I don\u2019t feel compelled at this juncture to ratchet up 10%, beyond 10%.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then, in terms of the margins, the 25 basis points still, I mean -- I guess this clearly sounds like an element of conservatism to that. Like what are the puts and takes that go through your planning when you still stick with 25 as opposed to maybe 50?","Rick Smith","I think you know us well enough by now; we tend to be thoughtful and maybe little conservative in our guidance. We guided 25 basis points for 2015, what was the -- operating margin was up 90 basis points and guiding 2016 with EBITDA margin up 75 basis points. So, I don\u2019t want to starve the business and you heard John talk about investment and CapEx, while was higher than we have historically, the standardized platforms to bring Cambrian, global to facilitate faster more profitable growth. So, Manav, I think it\u2019s Rubik\u2019s Cube and I think that combination of really strong organic growth that we\u2019ve talked to you about combined with margin expansion of 25 basis points. If we can get this business to do that year in and year out and get to our aspiration of goals, we alluded to 40% EBITDA margin, I think that\u2019s pretty damn good. I hope you agree.","Manav Patnaik","That\u2019s fair. And then just one last one from me, I mean I know you said it and your guidance obviously implies as well where you don\u2019t expect a consumer recession. But just trying to understand, like if equity markets operators drag and we do get there, like obviously Equifax today is much different than what it was in 2008, 2009. So, any high level comments on which areas should hold up and which areas would be a hit?","Rick Smith","We\u2019re not anticipating a global recession at this juncture. If it does occur, I look today versus how we were positioned as a company in 2007 has been dramatically different, LEAN as an example. And our ability to operate global platforms and take global processes and improve them, take cost out, and act and react to recessionary environment is far greater today than it was. We were in our infancy stage of understanding, globalizing the platform, globalizing the process and deploying LEAN around the world, so we could rack much fast if we had to in that environment. Two, just the overall pipeline of products, we have much stronger now. We are in early days of NPI; back then EGI did not exist; and so, just the ability to grind out organic growth didn\u2019t exist then. And lastly, we have built some counter -- two other points, countercyclical products that are bigger now; we do well -- think unemployment [ph] as an example, EWS that we do well in a recessionary environment. And we\u2019re more global today, especially with the addition of Veda and their platform. If the entire globe hits a recession, that doesn\u2019t really help you. But if it\u2019s isolated to a few of the developed markets, the fact that we\u2019re bigger global enterprise may help us as well.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi Rick. I would like to ask you about the Veda revenue and EPS assumptions that you highlighted for the 10 months included in Equifax. On kind of a like-for-like basis, what type of revenue growth does that assume and when you talk about the EPS accretion, are you counting on core synergies?","Rick Smith","Yes. I\u2019ll take a crack at it, and John, you can jump in. Think about Veda as a business that kind of fits right into our organic growth model, which is 6% to 8% and maybe the upper end of that, upper part of that range versus the lower part of that range. So, nicely in our organic growth target, not just for \u201816 but year in and year out, and much like the rest of the world and there is opportunity for tuck-in acquisitions in the geographies that are exciting to us in these early days. On the -- what was the second question?","Andrew Steinerman","Core synergies.","John Gamble","It does not include synergies. So, we didn\u2019t assume any meaningful synergies in 2016.","Rick Smith","Yes. I said on cost side. Yes, there really aren\u2019t many cost synergies. In fact it\u2019d be just the opposite. We\u2019re adding to cost Veda to brings things like Cambrian and InterConnect and other things to help link data, and grow faster. ","John Gamble","Andrew, if you look at the last reported revenue of Veda, and then take a look at what we have just indicated, growth rate for 18 months for that to be in the high single, it\u2019s near 10%.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. And just more on that. Rick, are you counting a lot on comprehensive data being a meaningful impact to the Australian market over the next couple of years when thinking about the Veda acquisition?","Rick Smith","The model did not contemplate that Andrew. I\u2019d tell you what I walked away on my last visit with the team down there more impressed with the way in which contributors have been contributing data, positive I should say. So, it\u2019s not right now in our guidance, it\u2019s not in the model we use to justifying buying the company. But I\u2019m more hopeful and impressed now than I was in early days that it will be a meaningful change down the road.","Operator","We will take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hi, good morning. You already commented on USIS maybe being towards the lower end of the long-term targets but how about the other businesses; are any of them in position to be above the high end this year or do we think those targets by segment are good places to be for 2016?","Rick Smith","Look, the ranges are there for a reason; we think they\u2019re pretty solid ranges. And you\u2019re going to see nuances and noise quarter-to-quarter, as you guys know and maybe even year-to-year but over multiple years, those ranges are still pretty good. The one -- again, one business that\u2019s really clicking on all cylinders and probably has more runway to exceed would be EWS. Their sandbox is just -- it\u2019s a bigger sandbox and there less mature business and they\u2019ve got early days of growth. If there is one that you\u2019ve got to say maybe has more opportunity to outperform, it\u2019s that one.","Gary Bisbee","And would that include your commentary about mortgage being much tougher comps still able to be where you are?","Rick Smith","Absolutely. And the other thing I\u2019d say maybe too is -- so, yes, that\u2019s including the mortgage environment I just alluded to down single-digits and we\u2019ll have to outperform it. Obviously if mortgage is stronger and we expect that benefits EWS as well as USIS. But then the other business maybe short term in 2016 I think about having maybe more runway then that long-term model would be PSOL because they\u2019ve got some pretty good things going on as they redefine their model as well.","Gary Bisbee","And then question on within International on Latin America, a two-part question I guess. It seems like there is a lot weaker economic activity in a bunch of those markets, and you face a really tough comp. So, how are you thinking about that? And then specifically, can you comment on how much inflation in Argentina is driving the growth of that segment versus volume or unit sales of your offerings? Thank you.","Rick Smith","Yes, I don\u2019t think we break that. That\u2019s second part. But the first part is and I think I alluded to in my comments, what\u2019s allowing International to continue to grow at the rates growing in spite of difficulty economic environments in Latin America and other parts of the world too, is innovation. I mentioned that the majority of their -- two-thirds of their revenue in these large geographies are generating vitality indexes from new product innovation above 10%. So, if it weren\u2019t for that and they are also benefactor of EGI obviously as well. But if it weren\u2019t for those innovative approaches, to products and EGI, they would not be performing like they\u2019re performing.","Gary Bisbee","Great. And then, just one last clean up one. Do you have -- I know it\u2019s early but do you have a sense for what we might expect the amortization and depreciation from Veda to be? Thank you.","John Gamble","It\u2019s early. And obviously as the transaction closes, these numbers will be updated. But acquisition amortization right now, we\u2019re assuming it somewhere in the neighborhood of $95 million.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Nick Nikitas","Thanks. This is Nick Nikitas on for Jeff. Just switching back to Veda and maybe talking more about some revenue, potential synergies; you mentioned TDX has seen some positive signs in Australia. Do you guys really see that as an opportunity to leverage Veda\u2019s presence throughout the region or if any potential avenues you see to drive additional growth into the future?","Rick Smith","Yes. We\u2019ve got a small team down the south in Australia and New Zealand that represents the debt management analytics platforms. So yes, having access to a much larger sales organization with people, longer standing relationships will help our debt management growth. But beyond that, one, we\u2019re getting a business that\u2019s got great organic growth opportunities; alluded the fact there is inorganic opportunities. And then the others are bringing things like The Work Number to Australia, bringing Cambrian to Australia, bringing InterConnect to Australia, bringing our global fraud platform to Australia. It\u2019s hard, you can\u2019t underestimate the relationship these guys have in Australia and New Zealand and the market presence they have with all major verticals is significant.","And they build out, much like Equifax has in Australia and New Zealand, a very wide array of unique data assets. And if we can bring our knowhow to bear there, to build products, that is a great growth driver. And then, as someone -- I think that Andrew asked a second ago, eventually when comprehensive as he referred to or positive data as many referred to it, when that becomes mainstream, guess what, we know how to manage positive data and build platform on positive data really well. And that in years to come there is another growth driver for us.","Nick Nikitas","And just within the UK, was TDX a sizable contribution to 4Q or is that still thinking about \u201816 more of a strong contributor there and if we are looking at growth rates similar low double-digit European growth rate is possible?","John Gamble","Yes. We saw very nice growth rates in the core UK business. TDX continued to provide growth. But we saw very nice growth rates in the core UK business as well. And just to make sure everyone understands my answer. The $95 million for Veda acquisition amortization is an annualized number; it\u2019s not the \u201816 number, it\u2019s an annualized number.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi. Thanks, good morning. Rick, it\u2019s interesting the way the way the PSOL business has evolved generally and direct-to-consumer in particular and obviously Credit Karma was a big win. Can you frame up perhaps the additional opportunities in DTC; is Credit Karma probably the biggest single opportunity you see out there recognizing that the market\u2019s changing pretty quickly and you have some new entrants or are there other large potential targets too that could be callouts, the way Credit Karma was?","Rick Smith","No doubt that Credit Karma in the U.S. marketplace for the reseller side or the indirect channels we call is uniquely large piece of business. So, might there be a larger U.S. piece of that? Might be; I don\u2019t see it as probable. The LifeLock is going to be a very good add to us expanding was PSOL does.","And also think about -- well you\u2019ve got -- there is two other things that are important. You\u2019ve got now taking that same concept of Credit Karma to other geographies, which we operate, taking it to Australia, taking to Canada, taking to UK. And also you\u2019ve got Dann Adams. Now, one of beauties Andrew of moving leaders around the different businesses is they have a different perspective than the predecessor. And Dann is looking at this business now saying kind of look at the breach market differently. He is looking at saying how do I combine some of the assets we have from EWS where he was for five and half years, into the global PSOL channel. So, it\u2019s not just the large indirect resellers who give me hope for long-term growth in PSOL, it\u2019s the four levers we talked about plus taking other data assets into PSOL.","Andrew Jeffrey","And, I\u2019ll ask you I guess the same question around Workforce Solutions. It seems like every year there is another wrinkle, another innovation, another customer; has this been an exceptional period given developments like ACA where you\u2019d say hey that this was just a remarkable time, or are we looking at the pace of change and an opportunity set that is structurally bigger than you might have thought it was two or three years ago?","Rick Smith","It\u2019s the latter and it\u2019s by far the latter. I can see a day where this businesses so dramatically bigger than it is today, not just in U.S. but global. Andrew we are going wake up ex number of years, and it\u2019s going to be a couple of more geographies that are really important to us. I talked about trended data. We are just now in early days with trended data; we\u2019re building the capabilities for trended data. So, I would be remiss if I would say the leadership that was there was outstanding; they did a hell of a job and I am sure -- and Dann has done a hell of a job out there as you know and we\u2019ve seen the financials. We\u2019ll continue that progress and take this business to next level. And it\u2019s not farfetched to see at some juncture EWS being bigger than our core 117-year old credit business at margins equal to if not higher than USIS. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about that.","John Gamble","If regulation continues to extend, the opportunities to expand the compliance business, so it\u2019s not just verifiers, it\u2019s in employer as well, both side of the business.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay, that\u2019s pretty ambitious and pretty exciting. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question with Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.","Andre Benjamin","Thank you. I think most of my questions have been answered. I guess on the back of the question that was just asked about the EWS, it\u2019s clear that there is a lot of demand for these solutions globally. I guess in the U.S., is there any place that you can call out as a major area of focus beyond -- I think most of us clearly get the case in autos, mortgage, and government, but are there very obvious large areas that you should be going after that you are not today?","Rick Smith","No, I think we\u2019ve got our toes into everything but it\u2019s all relative, it\u2019s -- I hate this baseball analogy but again, are we in the bottom half of first inning or the top half of the ninth inning. In most cases, we are very early stages. So, the credit card is important to us, the insurance is important to us, prescreening is important to us. So, thinking about anywhere we are having affirmation that someone is employed and the confirmation how much someone makes across almost every vertical, there is a need to that. So, we are into virtually all of them Andre, but there are some, we\u2019re very, very early days where penetration has got years to go.","Andre Benjamin","And on PSOL -- I apologize if you covered this before I jumped on. But, I know you took up the growth rate longer term. And was there anything in particular about the re-org that should drive a material change in the strategy or is it really just getting everyone on the same page, seeing the same numbers and having unified goals?","Rick Smith","Good question. It\u2019s the latter. Structure does not necessarily always facilitates faster growth or in fact growth to be slower. This is -- it just intellectually makes sense to have one team manage every aspect of the strategy for consumer regardless of how the consumer buys that product, directly from us or through a partner of our. So that\u2019s why we did that. I don\u2019t think that in itself changes the growth profile. It\u2019s executing against the four-pronged strategy we laid out last year that gives us confidence that the growth of PSOL multiyear model is slightly higher than past.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brett Huff with Stephens. ","Brett Huff","Good morning, Rick, John and Jeff; and congrats on a nice job.","Rick Smith","Thank you","Brett Huff","Two questions; one, just focusing on EWS; you talked about the geographic expansion opportunity. The way I understand that business works, you need a database of numbers in order to really start having a product to sell. And you mentioned you had teams on the ground in several geographies. Are they just there constructing that database and kind of how long does it take to get to a scalable product in those geos? And then I have one follow-up.","Rick Smith","It\u2019s going to take a while. This is -- when I think about the multiyear model we communicated earlier, it does not contemplate internationally, and I would never do that. So, it\u2019s going to take a while to build that database. But we\u2019re good at it; we know how to do it; we get funds invested into it; we\u2019ve got people invested into it; we\u2019ve got customers we know very well; we\u2019ve got the technology; we\u2019ve got the platforms; we know how to do. We think it\u2019s a lot of good. This is something you look at over a five-year period of time and say got it, now it\u2019s growing revenue versus fourth quarter 2016.","Brett Huff","And then just a bigger picture question; I\u2019m trying to check off all I think are the major growth opportunities; wondered if you could just rank them in terms of your excitement? I guess the categories are trended data, Cambrian, the NPI\/EGI and maybe talking about Work Number going International; maybe there is another one or two I\u2019m missing. But as you think about the three-year opportunity in those, which ones are -- kind of how do you rank them?","Rick Smith","We\u2019re so good at, we\u2019ve done for so long is NPI and EGI. So that\u2019s something that obviously is investor or analyst thinking about it. So, we have a level of confidence and continuing it the way, just continue it if not higher. You alluded to the core EWS which was talked about quite a bit this morning, continue to grow international EWS obviously is one. Cambrian, you can\u2019t underestimate Cambrian. Cambrian will not only allow us to link to different data assets together but build product s you could not never build before but build them faster. So, time to revenue would be faster with Cambrian.","Obviously small tuck-in acquisitions that were so good at, but hopefully we\u2019ll continue to be really good. So, we know how to do it. That will be a vehicle for profitable growth going forward. So, the cool thing is I think you\u2019d agree is it\u2019s not just one, two or three things we\u2019re counting on for growth. The foundation has been built by these -- our teams that have got so many levers to pull, it gives you a pretty good confidence.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","John, just one, could you verify for me? As I do my calculation on organic constant currency growth implied for 2016 revenue, it seems to me that the range is 7% to 10% with the midpoint to around 8.5%. Is that correct?","John Gamble","That\u2019s what we got to.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then Rick, how concerned are you about the Australian economy and their tries to China and then impact of Veda or are you just really excited about all the opportunities to bring value over there and that\u2019s going to overwhelm that concerns that you might have from economic perspective over there?","Rick Smith","Good question. Yes, we spend a lot of time trying to understand and deconstruct the economic drivers of the Australian economy, dependency on exports to China. We engage some of -- I think the best economic minds on a global basis as well as local basis in Australia to think about that and have locked away with a couple of thoughts, Shlomo. One is for 2016, unless there is an implosion that no one has ever contemplated in China, they have diversified their and their economy as such that in fact the consensus even today is the stronger GDP in Australia than 2015.","The second thought I have is, they\u2019re going to have a session eventually. You can\u2019t define odds. I think they\u2019re the second longest running economy in history of modern time in the world, the China had a last recession; they are going to have one eventually. The third, we\u2019re making investment like this, we don\u2019t make any investment for a quarter, for a year, for two to three time. This is a part of the world we want to be in. We have great partner down there now with Veda. They give us lens into so many more geographies down there beyond just Australia and New Zealand. So, it\u2019s a generational bet, not to stay a quarter or a year bet.","John Gamble","Shlomo, just a reminder, what we actually guided to on organic constant currency growth is high-end of the 6% to 8% range, so\u2026","Rick Smith","For the Company.","John Gamble","For the Company. So that\u2019s -- it\u2019s within that range you indicated but the guidance was high end of 6% to 8%.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.","William A. Warmington","So on the direct-to-consumer business, you\u2019ve talked in the past about your four-pronged strategy, indirect; International; Equifax.com; the freemium market. And you\u2019ve had some success there, especially on the direct-to-consumer resellers, Credit Karma and LifeLock. So, I wanted to ask how sensitive is -- or economically sensitive is this business. And then, if it is economically sensitive, how strong are the trends towards credit literacy and other demands in terms of ID, theft protection and other drivers on the secular side that could potentially offset it?","Rick Smith","Yes. it\u2019s an interesting question. I\u2019ve not done a statistical correlation analysis between the GDP and PSOL business. So, if I gave you an answer, it would be wrong. But, I think about drivers mostly likely help individuals want to buy a PSOL product or products, it\u2019s am I employed; am I experiencing some wage stability if not inflation; am I in the market for something, those are tied together, right, helpful in the auto industry, if I\u2019m employed, home purchase and so on and so forth. So, I am not sure how to answer that. I\u2019ve not done a strong correlation analysis between what economic drivers and sensitivities drive PSOL up or down.","William A. Warmington","Okay. Well, thanks.","Operator","And we have no further questions in queue at this. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our moderator for any additional or closing remarks.","Jeff Dodge","Okay. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their time and their interest in Equifax and with that we\u2019ll conclude the call. Thanks everybody.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations. And with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2012 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will also refer to our non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax. Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. This measure is detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation table, which is included with our earnings release and also posted on our website.","Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab on our website for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us again this morning. Our performance for the first quarter 2013 was, in my opinion, strong and was broad-based, as 4 of our 5 operating segments delivered strong double-digit growth for the quarter. This performance -- a lot of the performance was primarily driven by the continued broadening [ph] focus of each of our business units as one of our most important strategic initiatives. They're all continuing to execute well and have energized their organizations to innovate and identify new and expanded opportunities for growth.","Take a quick look at the high level of the quarter. Revenue was $567 million, up 12% from the first quarter of a year ago. Margin was 26.3%, up from 25.4% last year. And EPS was $0.87, up 26% from $0.69 a year ago. So to put things into context, those results compared favorably to the annual outlook we provided in December then again in January of 10% to 12% revenue growth and operating margins in the range of 26% to 27%. We also guided in February adjusted EPS growth of 21% to 24%. So a solid financial quarter and broad-based.","In addition to the financial performances, the business continues to improve their market position by delivering high levels of innovation, analytics and customer service. As I always do, I'll kind of go through some highlights for each of the business units, and I'll also give you a sense for each business unit, what the outlook looks like for the second quarter of 2013.","The focus for USCIS for the quarter, obviously, was integrating our new central region, which was the acquisition of CSC, and preparing that organization to deliver accelerated core non-mortgage growth in 2013 and beyond. We've organized the CSC acquisition into what we now call, again, our Central Region. A number of activities are underway to train the sales force, integrate them into joint account planning and rightsize the organization to eliminate unnecessary redundancies. Rudy and his team are off to a very good start.","During the first -- during the quarter, USCIS also launched the first phase of our analytical sandbox approach for our second top core bank. We've talked about this concept of sandbox a few times in the past. And while it's now gone live a lot of great excitement there. There's a lot to be done in the weeks and months ahead, but this is a clear example of how we are leading and innovating for our customers. The database will be extraordinary broad-based, including our data, our clients' data, scores, attributes and potentially third-party data, where needed. With our modeling and analytical platform, this customer can brainstorm, test, validate and produce models to significantly improve their decision-making with consumers and small businesses.","With our unique Decision 360 data assets, intimate knowledge of the banks' modeling challenges, a dedicated relationship team and understanding of the clients' complex data consumption requirements, we are uniquely qualified for this type of opportunity. It's really exciting to see us take our relationship with these big banks to a whole new level strategically.","Finally, we continue to make good progress on the verticalization of our sales organization in USCIS. Growth is beginning to accelerate in some of our focus areas. For example, we created late last year a vertical around the automotive segment in the U.S. And in the first quarter, the automotive vertical exceeded 10% growth, while the market grew at approximately 6%.","While organic growth was below our long-term target in the first quarter, it was largely in line with what we had expected for USCIS. The slower growth is really due to a particularly strong performance in 2012. A relatively slow January in the U.S. can explain why. It was weather, it was sequestration, uncertainty regulatorily. But market overall we felt was slow in January. The good thing is it picked up nicely in February. That pickup continued in March. The trend continues into April. As we look at USCIS, we look forward into the second quarter, we see USCIS clearly coming in line in our long-term growth projections we gave you, which is back in the range of 5% to 7% organic growth. And total growth, when you include the acquisition of CSC, stepping up to 18% to 20%. So a good solid second quarter outlook for USCIS. And we'll answer any questions you may have regarding that during the Q&A.","While at International, they continue to make good progress on their strategic initiatives. Here's some specific highlights. They continued to increase the penetration on our targeted verticals like insurance in the U.K., telco in Canada and the financial institutions in Latin America. They continued to accelerated our growth of unique products such as fraud in Spain and Canada and eID in Latin America.","Expanding the geographical footprint of our unique decision tools such as InterConnect is now a program across Europe and in Latin America. We're delivering strong double-digit growth in our analytic services offerings throughout Europe, Latin America and Canada. They continue to grow U.K.'s Personal Solutions business at strong double-digit rates. That's been a transformed business for us in the U.K.","Russia. Russia continues to deliver strong operating margins and double-digit revenue growth. And during the quarter, we increased our ownership of a Russian enterprise from 43% to 50%.","Finally, India is progressing well. We continue to add new customers and add new data contributors, launch new products and improve our hit rates. Growth for International is expected to be in the upper single-digit range for the second quarter as these strategic initiatives continue to build momentum. Important to say also, as I think about International, it was -- and the performance in the first quarter, very much in line with our expectations and the guidance we gave you in December for International, as well as reaffirming that guidance for International in February of this year. So second quarter is expected to be very strong for International as well.","Onto Workforce Solutions. Workforce Solutions delivered another outstanding performance in the quarter and also positioned itself for some attractive growth in the coming years. Our total records in the database now exceeds 224 million. Dann and his team have done a really good job of continuing to find new and creative ways to add new records for that database, which as you know, enabled us to solve more problems for verifiers [indiscernible] accelerated growth rates.","At the Investor Day last December, we told you that the government sector was going to be a big focus for Equifax. And the recent announcement by SEITIS [ph] with Medicaid -- Medicare and Medicaid services. The CMS is a great example of a big win for us in this space. This project is uniquely tied to the Affordable Care Act, which mandates that all states set up a web exchange so consumers can quickly qualify, add for and enroll in healthcare benefits based on a variety of factors, including income. Our solution will reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, benefiting both the consumer and the state governments.","By the way, this is a great example of taking our fraud and ID Services business and which used to reside in the USCIS business. We had relationships in the CMS and bringing EWS in. Those teams partnered great together to win this very, very unique contract for us. As you may have seen, the contract is for 5 years and it is estimated by CMS to be worth up to the $329 million over the life of the contract. And just for clarification, this is the instant verification product, so it's a Work Number product that we're selling to CMS.","This year is all about building out the capabilities to prepare ourselves and prepare CMS to go live, the intent is to go live in the fourth quarter of this year. We expect there will be some revenue, obviously, this year, but it will be relatively small in 2013, building in 2014 and beyond. So as we get towards the end of this year, we'll have much greater insight into revenue outlook for 2014. But it's an exciting win for us. First, because we're selected over -- because of our unique employment in income data assets and technology capabilities. And secondly, it establishes us at a very important and valued contract with the U.S. government on a very significant initiative. It opens doors to the government that we've never had opened before. In addition, obviously, there are some enormous benefits for the consumer and streamline the qualification process. And finally, although there's development effort necessary to meet CMS's requirement, we anticipate fulfilling these transactions beginning again in the fourth quarter of this year. And not a significant CapEx expenditure. It'll all be ready.","Continuing with Workforce Solutions, they continue to make good progress penetrating some of our more traditional end markets, which we've talked about for a number of years now. For example, revenues in the auto and card sectors grew by over 50% in the quarter. And both segments continue to have long-term growth potential for EWS.","Finally, we've had some early wins with our new Central Region. It used to be known as CSC. And Workforce Solutions selling products into many of the larger financial institutions and customers, and we continue to make good progress penetrating our KCP accounts with EWS products. I'm sure you saw from our press release, the operating margins expanded by over 600 basis points for EWS for the quarter, in addition to the benefit of recording [indiscernible] revenue. Every business segment in Workforce Solutions expanded their operating margins in the quarter as they continued to benefit from investments and technology and improved operating efficiency. We can talk as much as you want to about [indiscernible] later on. Great performance across-the-board for Workforce Solutions. We expect Workforce Solutions to continue to deliver high single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter.","On the PSol, they delivered their ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with strong operating margin in the quarter. They signed 4 breach deals. They're delivering strong double-digit growth in Subscription revenues, primarily improving overall revenue per subscriber. They also continue to penetrate the Canadian market while providing technical and marketing support to enhance growth of our U.K. Personal Solutions product offering. Revenue growth for PSol in the second quarter is expected to continue in the low double-digit range.","Now after a difficult 2012 North American Commercial Solutions is making good progress with its customers and accelerating its growth to 10% for the first quarter. Further penetration of non-FI and telco verticals, share of wallet growth of existing customers and strong execution on NPI are contributing to the accelerated growth we saw in the first quarter. We expect revenue growth in the high single digit-range as these trends continue into the second quarter. And I'm confident that Commercial is back on the range of good growth going forward.","Now in conclusion, I feel good about where we're positioned. As many of you know, we have set high expectations for our management team and they have consistently delivered. Every business segment is healthy with an attractive set of short-term and long-term growth opportunities in front of them.","I'll turn it over to Lee now for the details.","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'll be referring to the financial results generally presented on a GAAP basis. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliation attached to our earning release for additional financial information.","With mortgage market activity generally holding in the first quarter at the elevated levels of last year's second half, as we expected, and with good operating execution on our growth initiatives, this quarter's performance was solid and at the upper end of the guidance range we gave last quarter. During the quarter, we completed the divestitures of 2 smaller, nonstrategic businesses, Equifax Settlement Services and Talent Management, as we previously announced. These are being treated as discontinued operations for accounting purposes, so the operating comparisons I will be sharing exclude these units from prior periods.","Now let me return to the quarterly results. Compared to the same quarter in 2012, for the first quarter of 2013, consolidated revenue of $567 million was up 12% on a reported basis and also up 12% on a constant currency basis. Operating margin was 26.3%, up 90 basis points from last year, largely due to operating margin expansion in Workforce Solutions, Personal Solutions and Commercial Solutions.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.67, up 15% for the same quarter last year. Excluding acquisition-related amortization, adjusted EPS was $0.87, up $0.18 or 26% when compared to the first quarter of 2012.","Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $245 million, up 17%. Excluding the acquisition of the CSC Credit Services business, organic growth in USCIS was 3%.","Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $176 million, up 14%. Most of the growth resulted from the CSC acquisition. Excluding the CSC acquisition, revenue grew slightly. Transaction volume was down 10%, driven by lower activity levels in telco and select lower-priced financial institutions, offset by an increase in average revenue per unit due to improved customer mix and some pricing initiatives.","Mortgage Solutions revenue of $30 million was up 33% compared to the first quarter a year ago, driven largely by the acquisition of CSC Credit Services. Organic growth was approximately 12%.","Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $40 million, up 17%. Organic growth was approximately 4%. The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 37.5% compared to 38.7% in the first quarter of 2012. USCIS operating margin decreased in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to 2012 due particularly to increased depreciation and amortization expense, which negatively impacted margin to 240 basis points.","Increased depreciation and amortization expense was primarily a result of the additional $9 million of acquisition-related amortization expense related to CSC Credit Services acquisition. In addition, transition expenses resulting from the CSC acquisition negatively impacted the operating margin by over 100 basis points in the quarter. We anticipate operating margins to move up in Q2 consistent with the long-term range we guided to during Investor Day in December.","Our International business unit's revenue was $124 million, up 2% on a reported basis and up 4% on a constant dollar basis. By region, Latin America's revenue was $47 million, flat in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency. Double-digit growth in analytical services and marketing services offset weakness in Chile, driven by the regulatory change that took effect in the first quarter of 2012. For the remainder of the year, we expect growth in Latin America to improve.","Europe's revenue was $45 million, up 3% in U.S. dollars and up 4% in local currency. Good growth in government and insurance sectors, combined with strong double-digit growth in Personal Solutions, offset weakness in our commercial information and marketing services offerings given the economic conditions. Canada Consumer Information revenue was $33 million in the quarter, up 4% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. Strength in analytical services, particularly in fraud services and marketing services, helped to offset mortgage weakness in Consumer Information Solutions.","International's operating margin was 28.1% compared to 31.8% in 2012. Last year's first quarter margin was by far the highest of the year, so this is a difficult comparative base. Margins in the year's first quarter and for the rest of the year are likely to be more similar to margins from last year's second through fourth quarter's high 20% range.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $124 million for the quarter, up 14%. Verification Services with revenue of $69 million was up 21% for the quarter, driven by strong double-digit growth across all market segments, including mortgage, auto, government and [indiscernible]. Total records on file ended the quarter at 224 million, up 7% over the year ago period.","Employer Services revenue was $55 million, up 6% compared to last year. As to catch up on the work opportunity tax credit, employment credit services followed it's reauthorization by Congress in January and offset weakness in other tax management services.","The Workforce Solutions operating margin was 30.3% compared to 24.1% in the first quarter of 2012. With the renewal of the work opportunity tax credit program, we were able to record revenue for work that was performed in 2012. The resulting benefit to the operating margin in the quarter was approximately 160 basis points. Additionally, each line of business in Workforce Solutions improved their operating margins when compared to the first quarter of 2012, driven by strong revenue growth.","North America Personal Solutions revenue was $51 million, up 14% from a year ago. Strong growth in subscription revenue, breach projects and additional penetration in Canada were the key drivers of this performance. Operating margin was 28.4% compared to 25.1% in the first quarter of 2012, driven by lower credit file and monitoring expenses resulting from the CSC acquisition.","North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $23 million, up 10% on a reported and local-currency basis. Strong growth in our U.S. risk and marketing segments was partially offset by slowness in Canada. Operating margin was 21.3%, up from 16.8% a year ago quarter, as all business units delivered year-over-year improvement in their operating margins.","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Great. Thanks, Lee. For the second quarter, assuming current exchange rates and the continuation of the mortgage activity we've experienced in the past 3 months, our outlook for revenue growth from continuing operations is between 12% and 14%, adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be between $0.88 and $0.91 per share for the quarter. That's up 23% to 27% for the second quarter.","Our second quarter guidance for revenue and adjusted EPS continues to reflect the strong first half performance, which was incorporated to our full year guidance. Giving the anticipated moderation in mortgage activity for the second half of 2013, we continue to be very comfortable with our full year guidance of 10% to 12% revenue and 21% to 24% for adjusted EPS growth.","We're going to have a much better look, guys, as we release our second quarter results in July as to what exactly mortgage might be doing in the second half, so obviously, we'll give you those views when we're together in July. Any way you look at it, the results we have in the first quarter, combined with the outlook we expect for the second quarter, positions Equifax for yet another record year.","So with that, operator, I'd like to open up to any questions the audience might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Molly Garrett (sic) [McGarrett] with JP Morgan.","Molly R. McGarrett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the trajectory for OCIS for the year. Growth flattened in the first quarter. Where do you see re-acceleration and what will be driving that?","Richard F. Smith","Molly, I gave some insight there. If you take a look at the entire USCIS, it's lower in the first quarter than anticipated, really driven by July -- by January's results. And I gave guidance for the entire business unit to be in the 5% to 7% range. To get there, obviously OCIS has got to kind of carry their weight. So I expect improvement in the second quarter going -- that improvement continues throughout the year.","Molly R. McGarrett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And on mortgage, do you still have the same expectations as far as the market decline that you had at Investor Day? Or have your expectations changed at all?","Richard F. Smith","No, as I'd tell you -- alluded to at the end of my comments there, we're seeing continued, albeit slower growth than 2012 saw over 2011. The mortgage market is performing as we expected during guidance in December and reforming in February. For the first quarter, we expect that to continue in the second quarter. And when we're together in July, we'll have a much better view of the expectations for the third and fourth quarter. Right now, it's behaving as we anticipated.","Operator","We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you maybe just help break out the contribution from CSC in terms of revenue and incremental EBITDA like you -- just to try and compare the run rate to the full year incremental guidance you had given at the time of the acquisition?","Richard F. Smith","I won't give you the specific numbers, but CSC is performing almost identically to the guidance we gave earlier this year, financially, strategically, tactically. So all the guidance we gave you on EBITDA, margin impact and revenue impact is largely in line. There's nominal adjustments to the guidance we gave you before. Lee, would you add to that?","Lee Adrean","Yes, revenues for CSC are running ballpark about $30 million a quarter, and we expect that to hold through the year. We really can't directly measure EBITDA because we're consolidating it. It's hard to track the expense side. But consistent with Rick's comments, we're hitting our budgeted numbers, which were based on the case that we presented to you in December. So we're right on track with our incremental profit and EPS objectives.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then, Rick, you mentioned obviously that we should continue to see improvement for the rest of the year in OCIS. Can you maybe elaborate just a little bit more on this mix shift of the declining, I guess, as you refer to the lower-paying customers and move into the higher end? Can you just maybe give us a little more color on what the dynamics there are and what's going on internally?","Richard F. Smith","Specifically looking at what drove the performance in the first quarter and why I'm confident in the second quarter?","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, just on the OCIS side, you talked about the mix shift between the declines on the lower-end paying customers. But then you're, I guess, targeting the higher-paying. So I just want to know if you could provide a little more color on what that means.","Richard F. Smith","Great, great question, Manav. Traditionally, as you know, when you look at a portfolio of assets, assets could be traditionally like the customers that you have, like the products you have. We continue to look for ways to optimize that mix of portfolio you have, and OCIS is no different. We had some clients that were higher-volume but extremely low-priced, and that correlates to low profitability. And we continually look at those and say what makes sense short term and long term and modify that portfolio accordingly. So what we did in OCIS, to be very specific, is we have non-renewed, at our request, a number of clients but offset that with some very high-margin, lower-volume. So the mix was a good step forward from a profitability perspective for us. So don't think of that as being something that is a sea change mover continuation that you'll see significantly going forward. But every so often, we sit back and take that look and kind of prune the portfolio, the portfolio we want long term. That's what happened here.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And maybe just lastly on this, can you give us an example of the 2 different types of clients, like the high volume and the low volume but higher priced one?","Richard F. Smith","Examples, meaning verticals or examples...","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, correct.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I won't give you the client's name, but largely in the FI space.","Operator","We will take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Rick, can you talk a little bit about or elaborate a little on the CSC cross-sell efforts and where you see the greatest potential? Are we talking about selling some of your NPI solutions into that central region? And also, could you talk about the trajectory of the benefits you foresee from those cross-sell efforts as we go through the year here?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. One as I said before, just a little higher level math, the overall integration of the acquisition of CSC is right on target. It's going great. No negative surprises, a few positive surprises. So I'm really pleased at this juncture. As it relates to cross-sell and revenue synergies, if you go back to the time we announced this in December, what I said there holds true today. And that is, think about it this way. It's not necessarily there'll be new sources of revenue, but that time to revenue should be faster because we're not dealing with a third-party partner. It is our business. So what you're seeing now is our ability to bring products from NPI from across of suite of assets we already have into those customers in the middle part of the country. We're doing it with faster traction we could in the past. So that's the way I think about it. As far as trajectory, we're still early into it, 4 months into the integration. The effort right now has been on getting the culture together, the people together, the process together, and we have had some nice cross-sell wins at some financial institutions in CSC's territory. But it's too early to declare what that number is going to be long term.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when I look at this quarter, and we saw non-mortgage organic revenue sort of below your long-term targets, and it sounds like January was the culprit. If you look at the full year, even considering the slow start, do you still feel good about 6% to 8% core non-mortgage revenue growth? And then, how much of that is going to be driven by NPI?","Richard F. Smith","The answer to the first part of the question is absolutely. We expect to be back at the 6% to 8% range in the second quarter and for the full year. In NPI, I'm not sure we've broken that out specifically, but the NPI in total should continue to perform at the same levels -- within the range we have historically, which is 10% by value and mix.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one last one, if I may. Just from a macro standpoint, FICO made some comments last night generally about a little bit of a lift in the credit card environment. Could you comment -- CMS, I guess, Lee said was what -- up 4% organic. Are you seeing any movement in terms of the issuer's willingness to either ramp up marketing or come down the credit continuum at all?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, prescreen was up in the first quarter. So when you look at CMS, and I think the number we gave you was 4%, that's a combination of traditional CMS plus the wealth management business, the IXI business, as we call it. But the prescreen business was up -- I can't remember exactly what the number was. Jeff, maybe you do -- mid-double-digit for the first quarter, so we too are seeing prescreen lift in the first quarter.","Operator","We will take our next question from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So I didn't hear the core non-mortgage statistic from you guys. I know everyone's kind of alluding to it. But can you give us that number specifically so we're all on the same page?","Lee Adrean","For total company, it was about 5%.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It was 5%, okay. So that's what we have. And then Lee, you talked about transition expenses being about 100 basis points of headwind on the USCIS margin. Is it -- are you trying to say that in the second quarter you'd expect that to be negligible and that's how we should step it up, so 100 basis point sequentially? Or should we be thinking about this as you start to grow margins again on a year-over-year basis?","Lee Adrean","I would say, actually a combination of 2 things. One, yes, it should be -- transition expenses, largely though not completely behind us. The second is, because we are expecting stronger revenue growth in the second quarter, we'll also get some margin leverage from both.","Richard F. Smith","Dan, one thing Lee, I think, said earlier, was you should expect USCIS's margins to move into the range we guided to back in December and again in February.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then at the time of the CSC deal, you had talked about reinvesting, I don't know, maybe $0.10 or so of the potential accretion. I'm wondering how much have we seen kind of reinvestments so far? And then how much should we expect throughout the year? Just given how this quarter played out a little bit lower, was there a little bit less investment and we should expect that to be heavier in the back half, given that's where the acceleration is expected to occur?","Lee Adrean","Yes, to a modest degree. We are ramping some of those programs. You'll see some of that in the corporate line, so you'll see a bit more corporate line expense growth as we get later into the year. Some of that will go into the business units. But we were spending in the first quarter, but it will ramp up somewhat from here.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question. Can you just give us an update on what, if anything, is kind of transpiring around just the CFPB? And I know last quarter you talked about some clients being a little standoffish given how one of the products was structured. It's sound like you probably rectified that, but any update would be very helpful.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, we continue to work very closely with CFPB, and we're going to -- the focus, I think, as much in the last time was around getting a compliance governance structure in place, and we're making good progress on that when we come back sometime in the late second quarter, early third quarter to review that with us. So specific to the CFPB on a product position, we talked about IXI, and so the attributes there being potentially a concern of CFPB maybe [ph] discriminatory in some cases. We'll make a great progress there, building new models with different attributes. When the customers are satisfied, we're convinced CFPB will be satisfied with this one.","Operator","We will take our next question from Carter Malloy with Stephens Inc.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","On the Workforce side of the business, I think there's a couple of million of margin benefit. But even excluding that, there's a pretty significant gain there. Should we think about that as permanent process improvements and margin that's going to stick? Or should we model that margin back down going forward?","Lee Adrean","No, Carter. One, it was an outstanding performance, you're right, and [indiscernible] was a help. It was a drag last year, as you know, because we had all the expense and no revenue for EWS.  In the first quarter you get the revenue with virtually no expense. But as you model EWS going forward, you should think of EWS being in the 30% range.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then going into next year, will the CMS contract structure change that at all?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, obviously we'll know more as I mentioned earlier on at the end of this year. If it materializes at the level that the CMS disclosed, which we don't know if it will yet, it's work [ph] number, it's instant, so it's a very high-margin business. So let's hold that thought until we get closer to the year, we'll give you look at it then.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then going back to the question on CFMS, if you teased out IXI, which sounds like it's down again. I guess, one is, how much longer do we have to suffer through the comps on that one with that business being down? But two, more importantly, on the prescreen side of the business being up mid-double digits, Lee, can you tell us -- that was negative last quarter or that was maybe slightly positive, is that correct? It seems like a pretty big turn, and for you guys isn't that a pretty good leading indicator going into 2Q and beyond?","Lee Adrean","Well, first, IXI was down marginally. And it's kind of flattened out now year-over-year, so I don't expect that to be a factor as it was last year. In fact, we obviously are expecting that to return to growth. The last quarter CFMS comparison, I don't recall. I thought we were up in last year's fourth quarter over the prior year. Prescreen, up more than the rest of CFMS. But I think that had turned.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Is there a fairly material acceleration in this quarter, though. Is that fair to say?","Richard F. Smith","What's that, Jeff? It turned up -- prescreen turned up in the fourth quarter, okay?","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And historically, how good of a predictor has that been at least for the FI component of overall OCIS?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. Carter, it used to be very good indicator pre-recession, and then we've got a 45- to 60-day lag. We saw, as we exited the recession, that there was less of a correlation between prescreen uptick and on the core credit report uptick in USCIS. So we'll keep a close eye on that over the next couple of months to see if, in fact, there is a higher correlation returns to normal. That would be very encouraging if it does.","Operator","We will go next to the Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rick, two questions about -- one about sandbox. Any way to talk about or even size what the potential revenues would come out of some of these relationships? Is that possible? And second, is the CMS contract a one-off, or is there a pipeline of discussions you're having? Is there any way you could talk about the size of that potentially?","Richard F. Smith","Two great questions there. One, on the sandbox, I think I alluded to this in the last earnings call. There is -- whenever you stand at the sandbox, there's a revenue you get to load the data, to provide the services, to host the data, less than millions of dollars range. But more than that, it is -- I've have always said from day one, any time you can add this kind of strategic value to customers and get in there with smart people, look at data, look at attributes, look at scores and try to build new products, the real revenue comes downstream when we get to build new products, secondly. The third revenue stream is that some of clients are looking at this as a potential challenges. Do I want to outsource pieces of, if not all of, my analytics to someone like Equifax? And the sandbox is a great venue to prove that concept. So I think of the revenue stream really coming downstream here with new products and potentially outsourcing and that's exciting to us. As for CMS, yes, any time you get into a government entity like CMS and win a contract like this, this continues to validate and provide solutions to them, it will open other doors. For example, there's a potential that the government might look at pulling an employment record 1 year after the fact -- I'm sorry VOI after the fact. In short, if they have given you a discount for the Affordable Care Act a year later, how does your income look? So there are a lot of opportunities potentially for us to think of different revenue streams with CMS.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just thinking about the offsets to volume, it sounded like you said that there was obviously some increase in revenue per transaction and some other price levers to offset some lower volume overall, at least in the first quarter. If you kind of think about some of the offsets that you could see, if there were any volatility in volume from here forward on the OCIS section, do you still have those levers as you kind of go forward or are those kind of one-time items for the first quarter? Will there be other levers that you could continue to pull to offset any weakness in volume as we move forward from here?","Richard F. Smith","Well, one, I would expect weakness in volume. The forecast I gave you obviously contemplated certain volume level. Two, if you go back to -- I can't remember which -- who asked the question, but we intentionally lowered the volume with some accounts because the profitability didn't meet our thresholds, so that was very, very intentional. I don't expect that to be a continuation of new cleansing of accounts second, third and fourth quarter of this year. Did I answer your question, Julio?","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that helps. I guess I'm just thinking more on a macro basis. Then if things were to get worse into the back half of the year, would there be other levers? I mean it sounds like mix shift will be part of that. But you're comfortable at least relative to the second quarter guidance right now that there would be some volume improvements from here?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I do. And again, we have a lot of levers. And I don't know what to expect. I wouldn't give you the guidance for the second quarter and for full year that counted so [ph] and our ability to deliver those results. As you go with softness in OCIS or elsewhere, we have a lot of tools we could pull, including the right deployment of Lean, looking at costs, so on and so forth. But we're very clear. I'm bullish on our revenue outlook for the second quarter and for the full year.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can we may be take that thought to more of a -- I'm thinking more of a 2014 look at this point, I guess in some ways. What could derail the momentum that you guys have in 2013 as we really begin to zero in  on the next year's growth trajectory just thinking about kind of a lower growth prospect in our model. But it sounds like there's a lot of opportunities still ahead of you. You have the CMS contract. You have some other pieces that are kind of really ramping up here. What would be the puts and takes to really kind of consider in terms of sort of a second half of '13 and then being able to sustain that momentum into 2014?","Richard F. Smith","Well, it's the typical suspects. Obviously, what does mortgage do would be one. We've given you our outlook on mortgage. Two is, the economic environment, and we're anticipating that the economic environment in '14 will be much like '13, maybe slightly improvement. So the good news is, if we get some economic step-up around the world in 2014, that's wind at our back we've not seen since 2006. So right now, as I look at 2014, I look at our initiatives that we have here. If the economic environment remains like it is today, I think we're  in good shape. If the economic environment improves, it will get us a nice lift for us.","Operator","Next we'll go to Jeff Meuler with Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On the analytical sandbox, it sound like you brought another large FI in recently. It's obviously a unique offering. What is the selling process there, and what does the pipeline look like? If we look out 18 or 24 months, is this something where you have 20 different analytical sandboxes with different clients? Or should we more think that it'll be kind of limited to large FIs?","Richard F. Smith","A good question, Jeff. I think long term, a lot of the pipeline is strong. And the time to close, it takes a few months. It's a complicated sell. Intellectually, it is an easy sell, but then there's some work required to actually get the sandbox environment set up and then loaded and then analytics starting to come out of it. If you think about it for a second, you take a step back, one, I'm hopeful we'll get a couple of more large clients. But if you go to mid-market and you go down market, oftentimes, those FIs don't have the analytical resources that we have or the large banks have and so have even greater need to kind of partner with us. So I don't think this is only a very large bank or FI play. I think it's a play across the enterprise.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then on EWS, if I hear you right, it sounds like you're expecting a little bit of revenue growth deceleration in Q2. On the Verification Services side, it sounds like good broad-based growth and the records growth remains strong. Should we think about the Q2 expected deceleration just being the [indiscernible] impact in terms of not having that upside benefit from Q1 repeat or is there something else going on there?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, one, it's much in line with the contemplated growth forecast we had back in February. Two, [indiscernible] yes, was a little higher than the first quarter, it will be in the second quarter. And third, remember we talked about mortgage across the enterprise, including USCIS and EWS, starting to slow in the middle part of the second quarter and then continuing to slow in third and fourth quarter. So it's a combination of both of those.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one for me. Should we think about there being a permanent step up, I guess, in terms of North America PSol margins following the CSC acquisition as you take out what otherwise was pass-through revenue?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, again, that will ebb and flow depending on the marketing investment we want to make to drive revenue growth. We guided, I think back in December, Jeff, in the high 20s. I think you should continue to see think of PSol in that range but it will ebb and flow quarter to quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Rick, can you just give us an idea of some of the upside potential from the CSC acquisition, maybe some examples of things that CSC or you could not do individually in those geographies that you can do now?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, again, there's obviously some expense there, and we talked about that when we were together in December and again on the earnings call in February, and those are on track. Two is kind of the revenue. I mentioned that earlier, expanding new products to those geographies faster. Three is, I think there's some opportunity for pricing and folding their organization into our pricing process, which is segmentation on the same price elasticity, bundling and so on and so forth. Three, we have been very sophisticated in our approach to thinking about resellers, how you manage resellers to optimize profit, growth and strategic value. And we'll do that here with CSC. CSC has used over the years a number of resellers across their geography.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just to turn around in Commercial, could you talk little bit more about what was weighing on it last year, and just the contrast of what we're seeing kind of -- this starting to turn last quarter and now it looks like a real turn this quarter?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. Shlomo, I'll be very direct here. As I've told my team, this is executional -- lack of execution last year. We weren't paying as much attention to the pipeline as we should have. We are now. We weren't innovating it quite the way now I wanted to. We are now. The team has done a remarkable job of getting their hands around this, not feeling like they're a victim of the environment just because our competitors weren't growing and the market wasn't growing. But they shouldn't just grow. They've done a much for the job on those 2 fronts execution of the pipeline, getting closer to the customers and better innovation.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the Workforce Solutions margin, excluding that Workforce tax credit. It's a still pretty significant step up just on a sequential basis on the margins. So I was just wondering what else happened over here that made the margins step up that dramatically? Was there a piece of technology that went in or something else that's different that you're expecting the margins to be like that permanently?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, a couple of things that you should think of. One, it's a nice business model. When you've got a high fixed cost business and you start growing incremental margin, for sure at a very, very high rate, that\u2019s number one. Number two, they continue to deploy Lean at a faster rate than they have before. Three, they have staffed up significantly in the last year on pricing in the broadest sense, so that's segmentation, bundling and so on and so forth, understand price elasticity and value-added to the different clients. So a combination of a great business model with more rapid deployment of Lean. And third, a more effective deployment of pricing strategies, which we have benefited -- yes, I can't tell if the last part of your question was a question or a statement. But yes, we are comfortable with the 30% range.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, it all came together this quarter because you guys are working on it and it all just came together this quarter?","Richard F. Smith","Yes.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Rick, could you shed some more light on the CMS contract? Specifically, what's the level of visibility you have into the funding of that project? And then I guess, what are the milestones we should look for around funding? Is this at all at risk given some of the budget cuts in Washington?","Richard F. Smith","We are told by CMS that -- they announced the $320-some-odd million was, in fact, fully budgeted. Is that a risk, could it be a risk? Governments  always have some things at risk. Right now they're saying, this is our funded amount the next 5 years you're awarded. And we signed the contract. So as far as milestones go, right now -- I was just down at St. Louis 2 days ago, and the team is full bore out with CMS and internally building the capabilities to service them and go live October 1. So the next milestone for us might be a check in July. When we get on earnings call to talk about how much progress we've made building out the capabilities. And there's some capability requirements required on their side as well. It's a huge priority for them. They're working full speed as well. So the touch point would be July and how both sides are doing in technically preparing ourselves to go live in October. And obviously, the next touch point will be some time in the fourth quarter. In fact, during the third quarter earnings we should be in the midst of the CMS going live at that time. We're going to give you an update, and the third milestone and fourth milestone will be as we're together in February of 2014, wrapping up 2013, and we'll be 3, 4, 5 months into it. We'll get insight into what 2014 looks like at that time.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then, Boa Vista, could you give us some insight into the financial performance of that business and your updated thoughts on when you might increase your ownership in that JV?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, since we don't consolidate nor control, [indiscernible] nor should I divulge the financial performance. That will be their call. But as far as we're involved, we had a board meeting, I think it was yesterday and the day before with BV, integration continues on pace. It's approaching 18, 19 months now. I think it turns 2 years in July-ish. So the teams are working hard to integrate the 2 companies, build products, make sure we're out in the marketplace and so on and so forth. So we remain actively involved, and we'll give you a better sense on the timing, David, of when there might be an opportunity to increase our stake in BV as we exit this year. So third, fourth quarter this year, we should have a pretty good insight.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. The $25.5 million after-tax purchase price amortization to get to adjusted EPS, what would be the pretax impact of that?","Richard F. Smith","Lee?","Lee Adrean","David, I'm not...","Richard F. Smith","We'll calculate it, David. David, do you have another question while we're calculating that?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes. Other question was, what was the share count at the end of the first quarter?","Richard F. Smith","120 million, was it?","Lee Adrean","123 million shares.","Richard F. Smith","123 million shares, David. David, do you have another question? David?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, I mean, perhaps just a question on capital allocation going forward for Lee, kind of post the CSC buyout. What would be your key capital allocation priority?","Richard F. Smith","I'll answer for Lee. He's still trying to calculate the after-tax. The capital allocation part remains consistent with our discussion in February, and that is pay on our debt so we have some flexibility should we want to purchase some companies. Number two, continuing to invest in organic growth, NPI for us. Three is obviously dividend or share repurchase. But right now, which is no different than it has been, the primary focus is going to be really paying down that debt as we did in the first quarter. I think we paid down $107 million, $108 million in the first quarter. So continue that process, give us some leverage on the -- some flexibility on the leverage.","Lee Adrean","David, on the -- if I go back to the acquisition amortization addback, the $25.5 million was up $11.6 million from a year ago. And that is -- there was $9 million of CSC acquisition amortization, which we just simply tax affected that as -- that's about $6 million. And then the cash tax benefit is another $6 million. It's about $12 million. So basically that increase year-over-year is a function of CSC, and those are the 2 components.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. And then, Lee, could you remind me what the financing structure on the CSC buyout looks like in terms of floating versus fixed? And if there's a lot of floating, will you take it out more with fixed term over time?","Richard F. Smith","There was not a lot of floating. On the $1 billion we had about $200 million in cash. We borrowed a little under $300 million in commercial paper, and we issued $500 million in 10-year 3.3% notes. The $300 million of CP, we will take out with cash flow, but we will not -- other than that, don't expect to make any significant changes in our fixed and floating mix.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Okay. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today. And with that, operator, we will close the call. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","Thanks, and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge with Investor Relations, and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2012 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will also refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax. Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense. This measure is detailed in our non-GAAP reconciliation table included with our earnings release and also posted on our website.","Also, please refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section under the About Equifax tab on our website for further details.","Now let me turn it over to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As I typically do, I'll start off with a few comments financially for the quarter, second quarter, then we'll go through some highlights by BU. We'll turn it over to Lee for some detailed financials, and I'll come back and give you some color on the third quarter and fourth quarter, the second half of the year outlook.","Second quarter, if I look back, was the strongest and the most balanced quarter we've experienced in my 8 years here. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in each of the 4 U.S.-based businesses, along with double-digit constant currency growth in International. This performance was largely driven through our continued momentum across a broad range of strategic initiatives and high levels of execution, a theme we have talked about now for the last couple of years. We're also starting to see some modest signs of economic pickup.","Total revenue was $587 million, up 14% from second quarter of last year. Operating margin was 26.9%, up from 25.1% a year ago. Adjusted EPS was $0.92 a share, up 28% from $0.72 last year for first half of 2013. Total revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13%, and adjusted EPS was $1.79, up 27%.","Core organic non-mortgage growth rate accelerated from the 4.7% we reported in the first quarter to 7.5% in the second quarter, and that acceleration is expected to further as we go into the second half -- further expand as we go into the second half of 2013, enabling us to significantly mitigate the anticipated slowdown in mortgage originations over the balance of the year.","And now quickly go in each of the BUs for some highlights which are pretty fabulous in my opinion.","First, USCIS. They're aggressively pursuing market expansion and product penetration through their unique product offerings. A key client program, which we talked about now for, I think, 4 years has enabled us to significantly strengthen share in these accounts and grow our business with the 4 largest banks driven largely by new product innovation and strategic growth initiatives. That model of KCP, where we dedicate all resources across the company to driving share gain and incremental new spend, has been so successful. We've now expanded the program to now include 2 large credit card institutions and 2 large telcos.","Through our creative use of analytics-driven insights, we continued to deliver strong NPI performance in USCIS. During the quarter, we finalized the development and delivery of our analytical sandbox to one of our largest customers following their user acceptance testing. That's something we talked about in the first quarter. The pipeline for analytical sandbox projects now is robust as we further engage our large KCP accounts and develop new opportunities with many of our financial services customers. I expect great things from the analytical sandbox over the coming year or so.","So next, we will be launching trended data product in the USCIS business that will provide customers with a more granular understanding of consumer behavior through a richer, more robust portfolio of information. Through our Voice of Customer research, demand for this product is strong and crosses many of our end user markets. As a result, as you might guess, the pipeline for trended data is already very strong.","One year ago, we launched an expanded focus on the automotive vertical in the U.S. business. These efforts, which leverage multiple unique data assets of the company, are now generating solid, double-digit, organic growth. It's really the power of using our credit data combined with our VOE\/VOI data. And this is a market we are very bullish on, and we see additional opportunities for continued growth.","Next, in USCIS, their level of innovation execution, organic growth in USCIS core non-mortgage activities accelerated from the first quarter, and we expect that growth to continue to accelerate, just like the rest of the company, as we move into the second half of the year.","As anticipated, the total mortgage market originations are expected to decline approximately 35% to 40% in the second half of the year when compared to the second half of 2012. In that environment, we expect USCIS revenue growth to moderate a bit from the first half, which was 17% to 20%, and moderate down somewhere to the low to mid-teens in the second half of the year.","Next, moving on to International. As they have done now for many quarters, they continued to strengthen its position in the marketplace through unique, innovative solutions and share gain and continued to deliver some solid growth.","Our Latin American countries continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth. Revenue in our Technology and Analytical Services offering was 13% for the quarter.","In 2 of the most troubled economies in which we operate, our leaders in Spain and U.K continued to execute and innovate at very high levels, allowing them to deliver double-digit growth rates, which is remarkable in those environments. In the U.K., we've entered into an agreement with a top 10 consumer bank where we went from having 20% share to now becoming the primary provider for online credit information.","The unique set of product offerings and focus on customers has enabled Canada to grow at almost 4 times the rate of GDP. Great level of execution and innovation there as well.","Finally, by leveraging what Trey Loughran and the PSol team have done in the U.S. outside of the U.S. footprint, we're taking those capabilities in our platform now to our International properties, and PSol now is growing internationally at 35% for the quarter. For the year, we expect International's revenue growth to be in the upper half of their long-term target, which was 7% to 10% growth.","The transformation of Workforce Solutions' business model to a broadening of the end markets it serves, and maintaining their premier automated Verification Services offerings continues to drive strong, broad-based growth and expanded operating margins, as you've seen. Dann and his team have focused not only on the mortgage market but growing their product offerings into new markets. And for the quarter, it delivered double-digit growth in places like card, auto, government and preemployment screening. Just a great, broad-based growth there.","During the quarter, 2 large clients added 265,000 records to our database. And through our alliance partnerships, we've added over 100 new clients in the second quarter alone. Total records on The Work Number database ended the quarter at 225.7 million, up 6% over 1 year ago. Neat thing there is the team is continuing to develop new uses of historical data to help our clients and drive new sources of revenue growth for us.","Finally, I want to give you a quick update within Workforce Solutions on the recently announced contract win at CMS. The work effort is on schedule, and as we talked about in our last call, we expect to be operational by October 1. At this point, we've only factored in a modest level of revenue for the year given all the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of Affordable Care Act. And as I told you last quarter, as we get into the third quarter earnings call in the fourth quarter, we'll have a lot clearer insight as to what that means for us this year and next.","Workforce Solutions has improved organic growth in its core non-mortgage activities again by diversifying and -- into new and further penetrating existing market segments and by growing The Work Number database, which is a powerful lever for growth. For the full year, we expect Workforce Solutions to deliver revenue growth in the upper end of their long-term target of 7% to 9%. We saw it continuous to deliver strong, double-digit revenue growth with attractive operating margins through excellent operational execution.","Shortly after the close of the quarter, we made an important investment in PSol with the acquisition of TrustedID. This acquisition broadens PSol's product offering and provides additional growth opportunities. TrustedID is an affinity platform who's best in class. They service substantial clients such as AARP, mint.com, H&R Block and many others. TrustedID is also an industry leader in assisting consumers with monitoring and managing their online reputation within social media sites, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, and also enable consumers to control their offline identity through opt-out options with third-party mailing lists. Simply put, this was an opportunity we saw. As we look at expanding our presence into the identity space, TrustedID is fabulous there. And secondly, through the years, we've been trying to expand our presence in affinity, and TrustedID does that as well. It's a nice fit strategically for Trey and his team. We expect PSol to end the year with double-digit revenue growth, possibly exceeding the upper end of their long-term range, which was 8% to 12%.","On to North American Commercial Solutions. They delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue growth and on a path to finish 2013 with growth at or above the upper end of their 6% to 10% long-term target. An intense focus on executing their strategic initiatives, building a strong pipeline of opportunities and new product innovation, all of which are ahead of plan, has enabled their strong turnaround performance. And in summary, we have turned the corner with Commercial, and they're back on a path to solid growth.","Our performance for the first half of 2013 has been strong and has been balanced. The team continues to deliver a very high level of execution across our initiatives, including new product innovation and providing superior customer service. So in summary, I'd say the first half of the year was a great year for us. With that, Lee?","Lee Adrean","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.","This morning, I'll be referring to the financial results of continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis. You should also refer to the Q&A and non-GAAP reconciliations attached to our earnings release for additional financial information.","With our strong second quarter performance, we are well positioned to tackle the expected mortgage headwind in the second half. Let me first focus on the quarterly results.","Compared to the same quarter in 2012, for the first quarter of 2013, consolidated revenue of $587 million was up 14% on a reported basis and up 15% on a constant currency basis.","Operating margin was 26.9%, up 180 basis points from last year, driven primarily by operating margin expansion in Workforce Solutions, Personal Solutions and Commercial Solutions.","Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.73 a share, up 22% from the same quarter last year. And excluding acquisition-related amortization and associated tax effects, adjusted earnings per share was $0.92, up $0.20, or 28%, when compared to the second quarter of 2012.","Moving to the individual business units. U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $260 million, up 19%. Excluding the CSC acquisition, which we now operate as our Central Region, total organic growth in USCIS was 5%.","Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $185 million, up 17%. Excluding the Central Region, revenue grew approximately 4%. Transaction volume was down 2%, but average revenue per unit increased due to pricing initiatives and favorable customer mix.","Mortgage Solutions revenue of $33 million was up 38% compared to the second quarter 1 year ago driven by the acquisition of our Central Region and organic growth of approximately 17%.","Consumer Financial Marketing Services revenue was $42 million, up 17%. Organic growth was approximately 5%.","The operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 40.2%, which is flat when compared to the second quarter of 2012.","Our International business units revenue was $130 million, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on a constant dollar basis. By region, Latin America's revenue was $49 million, up 5% in U.S. dollars and up 11% in local currency. Strong, double-digit local currency growth in Technology and Analytical Services and Marketing Services were the primary drivers of this improving growth.","Europe's revenue was $47 million, up 14% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in local currency. Good growth in the telecommunications, government and insurance sectors, in addition to strong continuing double-digit growth in Personal Solutions, more than offset weakness in Marketing Services' offerings.","Our Canada Consumer information revenue was $34 million, up 7% in U.S. dollars and up 9% in local currency. Strength in technology and Fraud Services, Marketing Services and data breach services were the primary contributors to growth in the quarter.","International's operating margin was 28.7% compared to 29.2% in 2012 due to increased investment in growth initiatives and infrastructure but up 60 basis points from 28.1% in the first quarter.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $123 million for the quarter, up 12%. Verification Services, with revenue of $77 million, was up 21% for the quarter driven by broad-based, double-digit growth across all major market segments, including mortgage, auto, government, card and pre-employment. Employer Services revenue was $47 million, flat compared to last year.","Workforce Solutions operating margin was 31.1% compared to 24.2% in the second quarter of 2012 driven largely by widening margins in our Verification Services business unit. Approximately half of the improvement is from operating performance and half from lower acquisition and amortization expense as a portion of the intangible assets from our 2007 acquisition of Workforce Solutions is now fully amortized.","North America Personal Solutions revenue was $52 million, up 12%. Double-digit growth in our U.S.-based subscription revenue and in Canada were the key drivers for this performance.","Operating margin was 27.6% compared to 26.8% in Q2 of 2012, again benefiting from the lower credit file and monitoring expenses resulting from the CSC acquisition.","And finally, North America Commercial Solutions revenue was $23 million, up 12% on a reported and local currency basis, driven largely by strong, double-digit growth in our U.S. risk business segment. Operating margin was 16.8%, up from 14% in the year ago quarter.","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Richard F. Smith","Thanks, Lee. If I look back to February, we gave you a framework to think about for the total year. In that framework, we tried to define as best we could what we thought the mortgage market might do for the year. As I sit here now in late July, the overall mortgage market is expected to perform as we guided, which is quite remarkable.","Little nuances. The first half of the year was marginally stronger than our expectations. And the second half of the year, sitting here today, we expect to be marginally weaker than we forecasted. But in total, for the full year, the mortgage market is expected to perform kind of as we guided back in February. In contrast, the organic growth in our core non-mortgage activities accelerated in the second quarter, as we mentioned before, from 4.5% to -- or 4.7% to 7.5%, and we expect that to accelerate further in the second half of the year to the upper end of our long-term target for organic growth rate, which, if you'll remember, we talked about 6% to 8%. So we expect third and fourth quarter to be at the upper end of that range, which is very healthy.","As a result, for the full year, assuming current exchange rates and the anticipated decline in mortgage origination activity, our outlook remains strong. We now expect revenue growth from continuing operations to be in the middle of the 10% to 12% guidance range, which we gave earlier this year. That translates into approximately $2.3 billion. Growth in adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the top half of the 21% to 24% guidance range we provided earlier, and that translates into $3.56 to $3.61 a share. Operating margin is also expected to be comfortably in the range of 26% to 27%, which we gave guidance earlier in","[Audio Gap]","As well. So I think in summary, I'll described the second quarter as a very strong first half, which we're expecting a very strong 2013 and a very balanced 2013.","So operator, with that, we'd love to open up to some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Carter Malloy at Stephens.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So first, maybe on the core OCIS business. You saw a little pickup there, especially in non-mortgage. So can you give us a sense of is that just industry volumes? Or is that more pricing initiatives on your end? Any detail there would help.","Richard F. Smith","Well, it's a combination. But what's really encouraging I alluded to a bit in my comments, Carter, is we launched an internal strategic initiative, if you'll recall, 4G (For Growth), and the team came back with some ideas. And automotive was a great area for growth. We about 1 year ago deployed a lot of new resources there, a lot of new thinking there, brought in some outside consultants. And now, our business is growing 14% in the quarter, which is just amazing. And there are other examples much like that as well. So it is much new initiatives, expanding products and new verticals as it is pricing. In fact, I'd say it's more of that than it is pricing at this juncture.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And also, a pretty encouraging lift in your European business. You gave us some in the prepared remarks. But can you walk through again just what the key drivers are there? You mentioned PSol. Is that a meaningful piece of that business?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, the 35% PSol growth was all of International, and that's inclusive of those 2 geography in Europe. And...","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Is PSol a meaningful percentage of those businesses, though?","Richard F. Smith","In Spain, no. In U.K., it's a good size.","Carter Malloy - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay.","Richard F. Smith","But as I mentioned, I think it was last quarter, Carter, or quarter before, it starts with leadership. And we have got 2 energized, relatively new leaders in both U.K. and Spain, and they're looking at the business differently. They're innovating at a very, very high level, bringing new products to market. They're penetrating new verticals like insurance and government, for example in U.K., growing PSol dramatically in the U.K., doing new verticals in Spain we've never done before. And their execution across all initiatives is just extremely high. And the neat thing is, it's not just one quarter now. It's been multiple quarters where they've executed. And I think the future is bright there -- as you probably saw recently, some encouraging news coming out of the U.K. on their GDP. So we've got a little economic help in those 2 countries. I'd say even better for us.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jeff Meuler at Baird.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to revisit the guidance commentary since it sounds like the mortgage for the full year was in line with your expectations, but you're currently guiding towards the midpoint of the prior revenue range. I guess was the non-mortgage core acceleration consistent with your expectations? Because at least to me, it seemed like a bigger step up, going from 4.7% to 7.5%, than I would have expected. And then on top of that, you're layering on TrustedID. I'm not sure how much revenue contribution there is there, but it just seems like directionally, your order of magnitude, a bigger acceleration than we would have expected. So I was just wondering if you could comment on that, please.","Richard F. Smith","I'd say that it's important, Jeff, that we put it into context. We gave you a range 10% to 12% back 1 year ago, and different sell-side analysts developed different models and expectations for us a company. What we're saying now is the total mortgage market is going to behave largely as we expected. The organic growth initiatives is largely as we expected, just an acceleration. There was some concern on the call the first quarter where our core non-mortgage growth rate was 4.5% -- 4.7% in the first quarter. But we had planned on acceleration beyond that in the second quarter. We're continuing in the third and the fourth. So largely, all of our initiatives in the mortgage market are performing as we expected. As it relates to TrustedID, the acquisition we just announced for PSol, the revenue there is de minimis. It's more of a strategic play to give Trey a foothold, a great platform into the annuity market and a great platform managing our DMS.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then I know you guys have been diversifying the business. At this point, the Verification Services business, how much of that is mortgage?","Richard F. Smith","What we'll do is show the -- Between 40% -- it'll vary over time. Overall mortgage, about 18%. Verification at this peak might be 40-some percent.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And then just finally, any additional color you can give on the trended data product you referenced then but didn't give a lot of color?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it's a pretty neat thing. As underwriters continue to try to find better ways to make underwriting decisions and target the right people, today, as you might guess, they take a snapshot, a static look at someone's credit file. And if we can give them historical data, 24 months or so of historical data and how consumers have behaved month by month so you see a trended look, are they trending up, are they trending down, are they volatile, are they steady, that helps make them different product decisions and underwriting decisions. So that's what we're talking about now.","Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it.","Richard F. Smith","And it took us time just to build the infrastructure to house the data.","Operator","We'll go next to David Togut at Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Historically, pricing has been a very good driver of revenue growth for PSol as you've migrated consumers up to family plans and such. Can you quantify the impact that pricing is having on revenue growth this year and what you see going forward?","Richard F. Smith","Are you talking specifically for PSol or in aggregate?","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess let's start with PSol, and then maybe if you could give us a broader view Equifax overall.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I'm not going to quantify the number either now, but I'll give you a directional feel for it. The stuff that Trey has done, new product introduction, expanding the value to his customers with things like family plan will continue to have a positive impact. And I think that's an never-ending game, by the way. I think as we continue to innovate, think about how you add more value to our customers, they're willing to pay more. And that same trend holds true for Equifax. At the Equifax level, the aggregate pricing benefit for Equifax, there's going to be ebbs and flows year-over-year. But if you look at a multiyear period of time, David, it's pretty consistent year in and year out. One year, you may have a little bit more and next year a little bit less, but it is fairly consistent with multiple years.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So overall, what are you seeing this year in terms of pricing power?","Richard F. Smith","We're -- it varies, David. In some countries, where the marketplace may be different, you may have a lot of pricing power. Obviously, in other countries, you may not have as much, places like the U.K. where -- we're #2 player in the U.K. It's also clearly linked to the vertical, country, the business and their level of innovation. You've got a lot of pricing power if you continue to bring value to the customers, new unique value.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Where do you have the most pricing power now either by vertical or by geography?","Richard F. Smith","Let's think about that. I can't think of one that stands out as being dramatically different than another. Again, you might -- from time to time, David, some of them may come out with a really unique product in some part of the world and have a lot of pricing power there. But eventually, competition might catch up and someone else comes up with a great new product somewhere else in our business. So it is truly balanced. The stuff that Paul Springman and his team have built, and you've heard me talk about this before, they are top-notch, experienced strategic pricing people and tactical pricing teams as well. And they are penetrated in every single vertical, country, BU that we have around the world.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I see. I apologize if you mentioned this earlier. I joined a few minutes late. But did you quantify the contribution to revenue growth in the quarter and for year-to-date from NPI?","Richard F. Smith","We did not. But largely -- I don't have that stuff in my head either. I'll tell you this, though. We just -- we had a review. David, it is largely in line with the goals we've had. In fact, I think we're slightly -- we are -- well, we're slightly ahead of our budget through the first half of the year. So NPI continues to be a meaningful contributor, but we did not quantify it. I don't have it off the top of my head.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And what is the biggest driver of NPI-related growth this year?","Richard F. Smith","It's pretty cool. It's like we had the last couple of years, David. It's 60 to 70 products. It's every BU. It's every geography. A couple of years ago, we had a big hit, I think, called ESS, which you know of. Maybe 2 years ago, I think, it was. And we had another big hit in NCTUE+, the telecom and utility positive data. But by and large, what you're finding now in our 8th year of doing this, it's a lot of midsized, small projects all around the world.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just finally, Rick, I realize that you don't control the Boa Vista JV, but Experian has certainly highlighted the slowdown in their growth rate at Serasa in Brazil. Can you just give us a qualitative sense of what you're seeing in the Boa Vista JV in Brazil? And is that seeing a meaningful slowdown in growth given some of the civil unrest over there?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I think the things that the world talks about when they look at Brazil would be reflective to Experian, reflective of our business down there as well. I'm heading down, David, once in August, once again in October, to see the team down there. From our side, as far as integration, developing new products and getting products to market and getting market acceptance and so on and so forth. All of that is working well. But there's no doubt the Brazilian marketplace itself is slowing. However, I'm still keenly interested in Brazil because it's not just a 1-year bet or a 2-year bet. It's a 5-, 10-, 15-year bet.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Any update on when you might increase your ownership stake in that JV?","Richard F. Smith","Not yet.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Perlin at RBC.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Rick, can you just help us bridge the gap to this acceleration that you saw in this organic growth this quarter and then -- and accelerating into the back half? I mean, it was pretty stark, and I just want to make sure I've got the kind of key tenets. There's a lot of things you're throwing at us, but I suspect there's maybe 1 or 2 that you really want to highlight for us. If you could just kind of outline that, that'd be great.","Richard F. Smith","Well, look at it this way, Dan. I think it was -- first quarter was more of an aberration than anything else. And as we -- as Lee and I built the plan for the year, and we told you this, not just you but our investor base, that our long-term goal is to be in that 6% to 8% organic growth rate. And we had a bit of aberration for a number of reasons in the first quarter. Now you're seeing us deliver the kind of growth we expected in the second quarter. And you've heard me use a theme, down the path that we're executing at extremely high levels as high as I've seen. And that's allowing us to creep up to the very high end of that 6% to 8%. So it's no magic dust. It's no one product. It is sustainable, repeatable core organic growth, which is important to us. And by the way, we intensified our effort. If you're us and you're sitting there in the fourth quarter last year looking at these low interest rates and knowing mortgage rates, 10-year treasuries are going to pop up and mortgage rates are going to pop up in the second half of the year, we're going to go from a little bit of tailwind in mortgage to a headwind, we had to step up our game. And oh, I'm so proud of our team because all of our teams across the business have done just that, and it's going to enable us to have a strong second half to the year.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then when you look across your portfolio, in particular in the U.S., are you seeing a shift, modest or otherwise, really from kind of the affluent category to the non-affluent starting to pick up?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, I'm looking at Paul. Paul says yes, we are.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you just quantify it either anecdotally? Or just -- has it just started recently? We're starting to hear some indications at -- with other companies. I'm just trying to channel-check with everybody on this.","Richard F. Smith","What I think we are seeing is that the lenders, the banks for cards, for mortgage to some degree and for auto are going down a little bit in the credit scores. I wouldn't call it quite sub-prime but closer to sub-prime now than they were in the past. It's been probably [indiscernible] quarters now.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I didn't -- sorry.","Richard F. Smith","And the other thing there, as they go down, what we're finding, they're also doing, which we see as credit trends, is they're offering smaller lines of credits.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in that -- typically, when you go downstream, you're seeing -- you would typically see the velocity of your credit apps go up because they have to put up more? Is that still consistent?","Richard F. Smith","Correct.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I didn't hear why transactions in online were actually down 2%. I heard you talk about pricing being up, but I didn't think why they -- these were actually down.","Lee Adrean","Yes, they were down 2%. That's actually quite an improvement from the prior quarter. We've commented in past quarters on a couple of clients where we have a smaller position. We also saw in the second quarter a telco, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, was down a little bit year-over-year.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question and I'll jump off. The employee services was flat. I know the division was good. Is there anything to call up there in particular?","Richard F. Smith","No, I just think it's trends seen in unemployment claims. But there's a very encouraging thing there, Dan. We have a new great leader in Scott Collins. He's running the business for Dann Adams out there. We just had a review with those guys. And I have challenged them even in this kind of unemployment environment to step up their game and innovation. I think there are some very positive things you can see coming out of the employer business within EWS this year and return to growth, which will help, Dan.","Operator","We'll go next to Manav Patnaik at Barclays.","Unknown Analyst","This is actually Manav's associate, Greg [ph], calling in for him. On Commercial Solutions, which we saw had a pretty strong quarter, can you give an update on market trends and whatever company-specific attributes are helping to drive the growth?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it's -- Greg [ph], it's more than that. It's just -- I admitted this to the -- our investor base back in fourth quarter, maybe again first quarter. We just had poor execution there. And Alex and his team have refocused themselves on generating strong pipeline, both in the MDS business and the marketing business in Canada. We're improving our data quality in Canada tremendously. We're revamping our entire go-to-market strategy in Canada. And the U.S. risk business has returned to growth. So it's more of just doing what the rest of the business has been doing, which is improving the level of execution.","Unknown Analyst","Great. And then we saw some small tuck-in acquisitions like TrustedID. But can you give us a sense of what the larger deal M&A pipeline looks like? CSC seemed kind of like a no-brainer, but is there anything out -- any sizable deals that are on your radar?","Richard F. Smith","We always are looking for the -- strategic deals that make sense to us financially and strategically. The pipeline is good. It's tied to our strategy. We're in the process is just wrapping up our 3-year strategy. We maintain a goal of 1, 2 points of growth coming from M&A over multiple years, and I think you can continue to count on that. Again, you're going to have some years that are bigger than that. But in general terms, think of us as a -- being 1 or 2 points of total growth coming out of M&A.","Operator","We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","[Indiscernible] questions. Could you just talk -- and the most impressive part of the quarter to me is the fact that you guys are getting growth in areas like mortgage reporting, where you clearly have the wind blow -- starting to blow in your face, even in Verification Services as well where things are turning down. Can you just give us a little bit more detail about what are you doing? Is there other products that you guys are coming to market with? Have you cut other deals we're you're getting a bigger piece of the pie? How are you executing so well over there?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, that's a good question. I think if you separate that and look at EWS one way and look at USCIS a little differently, in EWS it is continue to gain greater penetration. Believe it or not, there were a number of mortgage underwriters historically who maybe didn't pool a VOE\/VOI. And now, Dann and his team are out there knocking on the doors day in and day out. So his ability to penetrate the mortgage market. I don't have those numbers memorized right now as far as penetration, but there's a lot of room to grow still. But he's penetrating now, so he's getting more pools for the VOE\/VOI than he has ever had in the past. He continues to look at his pricing for VOE\/VOI, which is another lift for him there because he is looking at new products as well. In USCIS, it's really new product introduction. And you've heard us talk in the past the launch of a product called UDM as an example -- as one example of solving mortgage problems we haven't solved in the past. And Rudy's also gaining more share in the tri-bureaus. But you always heard us say, Shlomo, if you go back 2, 3, 4 years, we used to always talk about the mortgage bankers index, or what the growth rate was, it was growing or declining, and our expectations through new products and through penetration was to outperform. So if it was up 5%, we expect to be up something more than that. If it was down 5%, we want to be down less than that. So the trend that you're seeing today is a trend we're really proud of and we've seen for a number of years now.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Do you think that you're at a point in time that you -- that the trend is going to have a meaningfully less impact on you given the -- what you're doing in some of those markets? In other words, the expectation is it -- for it slow down a lot. You have a lot of new products in the pipeline and a lot more market share to be gained that you think that you could continue to significantly outperform that mortgage bankers index?","Richard F. Smith","Well, that's a good -- it's a great question. I mean, strategically, the challenge I've given our team is we like to eliminate the cyclicality in mortgage. We're not there yet. We've got a long way to go. But the vision, the dream is to find ways to offset any cyclicality, any downturn we might have. But again, we're not there yet. And I'd like to do it within the confines of just the mortgage market. So today, we'll obviously having to rely upon core non-mortgage growth initiatives. But the challenge I've given Craig Crabtree, who runs our mortgage practice, is to utilize all the great talent we around here and to think about ways to minimize the cyclicality we have in mortgage. It's a long-term goal.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And one question for Lee. You're continuing to delever after the CSC acquisition. Where -- remind us of where your targets are at. And I would think, given the business model, even the 1.9x leverage, you probably still have a decent amount of capacity if another significant deal came by to be able to take that on. Can you just comment on that?","Lee Adrean","Yes, our targets are to be between 1 3\/4 and 2x EBITDA in terms of leverage. I think at that range, we do have some capacity in case a large opportunity like a CSC comes along. I will remind, you, I mean, we actually had levered down to 1.4x in anticipation of a deal the size of CSC. But for the deals in the multi-$100 million range coming from where we are today, we have the capacity to take those on.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Paul Ginocchio at Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Rick, I was just again -- I know you made some comments on the CMS contract, but have you learned anything over the last quarter? And is there any sort of update or different view on that I guess 3 or 6 months later? Then second, of the 7.5 points of organic or core growth, what percent -- what point -- how many points of that was due to the analytical sandbox initiatives?","Richard F. Smith","Great, Paul. On CMS, now it's -- the team is working hard on getting the infrastructure of the system set up and ready to go. We are expected to be fully operational come October 1. Beyond that -- and obviously, the government at the Federal level and state level are working very hard. We're working very closely with them. It's -- everything is unfolding as we had planned and had hoped at this juncture. And again, as I mentioned earlier, when we get back together in October for our third quarter call, we'll have really good insight at that juncture as to how the balance of the year will unfold out and next year as well. We continue to remain optimistic. The second point, as far as analytical sandbox, we just launched that, as I think I mentioned in my comments, that's just going live now. So as it relates to the second quarter 7.5% organic core non-mortgage growth, very little comes from the sandbox. I expect it to be a more meaningful part going forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Jeffrey at SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I apologize, I had to jump on late. So Rick, I hope I'm not going to make you repeat yourself here. And for Rick and\/or Lee, I guess, segment profitability was pretty impressive, especially in Workforce Solutions. Can you speak specifically to some of the drivers there? Or just tell me to read the transcript if you answered that question already.","Lee Adrean","Yes. The -- in Workforce Solutions, we improved by 7 percentage points year-over-year, following our first quarter where we also had shown very strong improvement. The -- in the second quarter, first quarter had a temporary factor in it that -- just a shift from Q4 to Q1. But the second quarter, and we'll see this on an ongoing basis, about half of that improvement came from some acquisition-related amortization that is rolling off from our original acquisition of Workforce Solutions that became fully amortized during the quarter. The other half is just real operating leverage, and it's 2 things. It's -- we've seen strong growth in the Verifications business, which gives us good bottom line leverage. And the second thing is we've been aggressively applying lean techniques to improve the efficiency across both of the subsegments within the Workforce Solutions business. And the 2 of those drove about half of that improvement, so you're seeing real cash improvement in those margins.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Would you consider that an inflection point?","Lee Adrean","No, I think this is probably more moving to another -- I'm not going to say plateau. We try to drive some improvement every year, but I don't see it continuing dramatic improvement. I see us now having moved from the low to mid-20s up to the very low 30s.","Richard F. Smith","Yes, it's -- I have a little color to add there. I agree with that completely is, you had the big step up because of the amortization rolling off. We'll always expect every business unit leader to continue to drive efficiency and productivity to give us some incremental lift. And because of the great model we have, as we grow online business like VOE\/VOI, they'll get some more. I don't -- we're not going to get 300, 400 basis points of improvement every year, but you'll expect -- we should expect continue to have some improvement in margin across all businesses, including EWS.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Rick, you've done a great job with NPI and clearly demonstrating that Equifax is much more than a mortgage play. When you think strategically about incremental technology or data sets, what comes to mind? What should we think about you doing from a strategic perspective over the next 3 to 5 years to sustain the out-performance that you've enjoyed certainly post-recession?","Richard F. Smith","Well, thank you for the compliment, Andy. There are so many levers we have to take this company to a much higher level of profitability and top line growth. I'm really excited about analytics. We've got a world-class guy we brought in. He ran all of analytics for Hewlett-Packard. He's working for Paul Springman now. There is a lot of money to be made by expanding how we think about analytics. But we're in a process of finalizing our strategic plan rollout out there. Fraud and ID, there's a big play for us there. I mean, if you think about the CMS, there's an element of identification to make sure there's no fraud in the salary level there. And that's a huge potential for us. There's so much more we can do there, and we're investing heavily in that for -- with Rajib Roy and his team. There are some geographic places we don't play today that I'm extremely excited about expanding our footprint there beyond just Brazil, for example. Auto, we talked about auto. Auto, we say, was just an afterthought 2 years ago. Now we're getting significant traction and great growth because of our unique data assets. In government, there is a world -- getting the CMS win is great for -- is the revenue that may come from CMS, but it's opening the doors to different branches within the government at a rate we never anticipated. And then lastly, we talked about a few times insurance offers a lot of hope and potential for us as well. And places like U.K., we're already gaining traction. In the U.S. as well.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one last one if I may. I think I heard you mention perhaps that issuers are coming down the credit continuum a little bit. Is that incremental to what you've seen over the last few quarters on the -- specifically on the consumer credit card side of your business?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. So they were obviously coming out of the recession. We're reluctant to loan to this lower credit spectrum. What we're now saying is yes, this incremental outreach where they're offering smaller lines of credit but offering lines of credit to like sub-prime or lower than prime. So yes.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So we're talking like maybe the 675 to 700 kind of FICO range?","Richard F. Smith","Correct.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Rick, in your opening remarks, you talked about some signs of economic improvement kind of helping. My -- and I know you used the word modest. My question is, where do you see that in your business? Is it what you just said, issuers moving down the spectrum? Is there some place else that you can actually point that it's helping your business maybe from a consumer credit standpoint more broadly? Or what you're saying, hey, in the context of our guidance, we're reassured with how the economy feels?","Richard F. Smith","Yes. Good point, Andrew. Let me sort of clarify. One, yes, we're seeing in the credit card issuance as an example, we're going down market. So you're seeing it in auto sales pick up. As auto sales pick up, there's a benefit to us, and it's going to continue in 2014 as well. Home sales are starting to pick up, and that will bode well over time. It's important -- but one second, I will come back to the heart of your question in a second. If you think about the mortgage market, obviously modestly better than first half, about as expected and modestly worse in the second half. We expect the first half of 2013 on the refinancing to be tough as well, much like the second half year, but then a pickup in the second half. And you're also starting to see existing home and new home sales pick up as well. So I look to the second half of next year but you anniversary the refinancing kind of fallout, and now you have new home sales and existing home sales continuing to climb, that bodes very well for us. The other point on economic pickup is you're starting to see now for the first time in years a bit of a pickup in GDP growth, which is helping consumer confidence in the U.K. and so lending in the U.K. as well.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's cool. And just could you square in with credit card? You mentioned in your comments just now that it's come up slightly in other parts of this call. Is credit card applications, as it relates to USCIS, up now? Is it still modestly up or at the bottom? How would you describe credit card, which is a bigger segment, I think, for -- than mortgage?","Richard F. Smith","Yes, the prescreen business was up, Jeff, was it -- -- some 7% in the second quarter. So it's starting to trend in the right direction.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. I didn't mean the prescreen, I meant the actual credit card applications driving consumer credit reports.","Richard F. Smith","Oh, it's up modestly.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.","Jeffrey L. Dodge","We want to thank everybody for your participation. And with that, operator, we'll conclude the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"8691":["Equifax Inc.

","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead sir.","Jeff Dodge","Thanks and good morning everyone. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge, Investor Relations and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Lee Adrean, Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section, in the About Equifax tab of our website at www.equifax.com. ","During this call we'll be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our businesses are set forth in the filings with the SEC, including our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measure, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax that will be adjusted for certain items which effect the comparability of the underlining operation performance.

Thanks for joining us this morning. As I always do, I\u2019ll start off with a couple of high-level comments on how the company performed in the first quarter. I'll then gravitate towards some details at the business unit level and then come back to the corporate level and give you an update on a couple of key initiatives company wide, and Lee will go through his detailed financials and we\u2019ll come back and look at the second quarter, the balance of the year and then we\u2019ll do some Q&A. ","Our first quarter performance, in our opinion was solid. We came in a little bitter than we had initial expected, all the business units continued their strong execution of their strategic initiatives and that will enable us to offset both the mortgage and the currency headwinds, which we described here during our last quarter call for the fourth quarter. ","For the first quarter revenue was up 3% to $585 million on a reported basis, about 5% on local currency basis versus the first quarter 2013. The strategic acquisitions, which we recently completed, are enabling us to further leverage our core business assets and drive new sources of growth. ","Early stage integrations are off to a good start and we are optimistic that all the acquisitions we made late fourth quarter and the first quarter will bode well for us going forward. ","For the quarter our core non-mortgage market growth rate was 7%, solidly in the range we had targeted, about 6% to 8%. Operating margin was 26%, down slightly from 26.3% a year ago and our adjusted EPS was $0.89, up from $0.87 last year. ","Our U.S. now are going to the individual business units, starting with USCIS. They delivered another solid quarter with strong execution. Their initiatives are consistent with our expectations. USCIS core non-mortgage market organic growth for the quarter was a solid 6%. ","They are continuing to leverage innovations, to develop and deliver unique insights to the customers through partnerships and multi-product offerings that leverage our unique capabilities. I\u2019ll give you a few examples there. First is, we\u2019ve announced recently the partnerships with IHS, you remember HIS versus Polk last year. ","So we announced this partnership, we\u2019re going to develop product offering for one of our focus verticals we talked to you about and that\u2019s automotive. Our first product is lost sales analysis for lenders, which helps them understand an actual situations where they lost good opportunities to competitors and helped them build a strategy to not loose those in the future. Off to a great start, automotive is a great growth vehicle for us going forward. ","Another example, we\u2019ve have identified a number of opportunities for integrating multiple data assets along with some of our proprietary analytics to develop what we call \u2018super scores\u2019 that enable our customers to make better decisions on higher risk opportunities about something they would normally pass on and they now able to underwrite those risks. The market interest is increasing nicely and our customers are increasingly focused on growing their running portfolios. ","We talked about Mobile Commerce. We\u2019ve got a great initiative, a partner called Jumio. They are a next-generation payments and ID company to help our customers maximize their opportunity with Mobile Commerce, while reducing fraud and streamlining mobile payments; really exciting early state opportunity. ","In the mortgage space we continue to bundle undisclosed debt monitoring, which we\u2019ve talked to you about our 4506-T product, verification of employment, verification of income and bundle all those products to a very unique decision platform, which we have in a mortgage market and these solutions are allowing us to increase our market penetration and to drive growth. This continues innovation in this large market has enabled us to mitigate the impact of the market decline, while positioning us to accelerate faster when the market conditions improve. ","We\u2019ve seen the MBA data for the quarter; we\u2019ve seen how we\u2019ve outperformed the MBA. We\u2019ll talk about that in the Q&A as well and that\u2019s largely driven by our unique offerings in our new decision platform. ","In Fraud and ID Management we\u2019ve made significant progress, particularly in the government sector. We are providing identity authentication for selected IRS portals in support of the strategic goals for reducing fraud, improving service, extending processes and improving efficiencies. We are also undertaking projects for health and human services, leveraging our proactive fraud solutions products and we continue to sign new accounts in the state agency market with our identity proofing services.","International; its a critical long term growth early for us and in the first quarter they performed well. Retained a little over 24% constant dollar growth, driven by solid organic growth in addition to contributions from their recent acquisitions. ","In the midst of integrating TDX, you recall, quite a few hits recently and we are aggressively working on a plan, not only to integrate them, but to take their capabilities and solutions to countries outside their current footprint. They are predominately if you recall U.K. based company, we saw our operations in Spain and Australia. We have high hopes that this is going to have a fit in places like Canada, Argentina, Brazil and the U.S. and teams are working diligently to lay those plans out for execution later on this year. ","We now have InterConnect implemented in five additional countries with a sales pipeline extended into six other countries. InterConnect ultimately enable us to deliver Decision 360 products in these counties and most importantly as you know we\u2019ll get these decision platforms ingrained into our good customers, our stake in this goes up significantly. ","In our non-consolidated investments overseas, both Russia and India are exceeding our expectations. We also made very good progress with our Brazilian partners and expect solid growth with them in 2014 and beyond. ","Following an outstanding performance in 2013, Workforce Solutions delivered core non-mortgage market, organic growth of 10% in the first quarter, another outstanding quarter for Workforce Solutions. They continue to deepen our penetration of many of our existing served markets, while broadening the markets they serve with unique high value products. ","For the first time in a long time, home equity lending is up dramatically and the need for employment and income verification services provides new growth opportunities for us. We are at the very early stages of home equity lending coming back and late in the first quarter we started seeing the benefit of that. We expect that to continue throughout the balance of the year. ","One of Workforce Solutions newest offerings is getting very good attraction. The solution offering the ACA Management Platform provides customers with automated dashboards that enable them to evaluate, track and report their compliance with the Affordable Care Act. ","If you recall few years ago we acquired eThority, which is a major analytics company. We leveraged that capability to help our customers, employers be sure they are complying with the Affordable Care Act. We have now signed up more than 100 major organizations with this platform to ensure they are compliant; exciting for those guys. In another way we bring analytics to every part of our company, now including EWS.","We are also making good progress on our targets on the Work Number database. We now have almost 3,400 companies contributing their Work Number records up 7% from year-end. Our records are now exceeding 240 million in our database and we are well on our way to reaching our short term goal, which we\u2019ll talk to you about, of 250 million total records and 7 million active records will soon come back with a new base line for your larger target going forward and any other implications of that. ","Finally our contract with CMS, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services was renewed for another year. If you recall we signed the contract a year ago. It was a one-year contract with one-year renewals they have come back and have renewed it. We could talk about that in the Q&A session as well, but getting off to a good start there. ","Personal Solutions continue to make good progress with the integration of TrustedID, while continuing to execute at a high level on the strategic initiatives. TrustedID has been successful in opening up new growth opportunities for PSOL in indirect market and providing us with opportunities to redirect our resources to better address the change in the competitive landscape. ","In fact I think as we look forward to the next, one, two, three, four years of indirect market we\u2019ll be in fact the significant growth driver within PSOL. And PSOL on the core business, they kind of tweak their business model to address the inroads being made by free scores, free services, marketing expenditures in that core business have been reduced a bit, which is resulting in over time higher profits and slightly lower growth we talked to you about last quarter, that combined a great combination with indirect and direct. ","Finally North American commercial solutions began the integration of Forseva, whose decisions platform enable us to deliver high value decision solutions to small business information market. High single digit growth in transaction revenues for the quarter were largely offset by a decline in the project-oriented revenues. You know the project revenue can be lumpy, but the good news is we are seeing the transaction revenue growing, which is a good sign. ","A couple of quite highlights for the company now. As you all know, successfully executing on all of our enterprise wide initiatives in a critical comparative to us. The management\u2019s discipline that underpin our ability to execute a high level and ingrained almost every time, we give you a couple of examples. As you know seven years ago we launched NPI, New Product Innovation Program. We\u2019ve had great success over the seven years. In fact 2013 represented our largest revenue contribution from products over the previous three years. ","At this juncture, with seven years into it and to keep it fresh we have launched a new program called NPI 2.0, which is really to reinvigorate NPI innovation across the enterprise to again like four, five years of great runway from NPI. We launched that earlier this year, it\u2019s off to a great start. ","LEAN continues to be an important part of our DNA. Its delivering significant benefits internally, which we talked about, but also externally with our customers who engaged us to help them operate more efficiently and more effective, another way to differentiate ourselves from the competition. ","As we enter 2014 I expected the first quarter to be the most challenging quarter we\u2019ve faced due to the fact we had mortgage headwinds. The sluggish economy, that\u2019s weather and FX. It was a difficult environment, but in that environment this team brought a very, very solid performance and as I looked at the balance of the year we started to see signs of strengthened economies around the global in which we operate. We are seeing that the mortgage headwinds will start to abate towards the end of this quarter, improve a little bit in the third quarter and with wins back in the fourth quarter. ","We continue to executive at very high level on our innovation. The things that we\u2019re doing on vertical focus is really making a difference and I can tell you, I\u2019ve seen more share gains and wins in the market place in these key verticals with the Decision 360 platform, than I have seen since we\u2019ve launched Decision 360 a number of years ago. ","So I believe right now we are saying with the convergence of all these good things, it will position us very well towards the balance of 2014 and into 2015. So, with that Lee. ","Lee Adrean","Thanks Rick and good morning everyone. This morning I'll be referring to the financial results from continuing operations generally presented on a GAAP basis.","Our first quarter performance was solid in the phase of the challenging mortgage headwinds, which we anticipated. As we indicated during our fourth quarter release, those headwinds will continue into the second quarter and moderate substantially in the second half. Our full year outlook has not changed. ","Let me turn to the quarterly results. Compared to the same quarter in 2013, for the first quarter of 2014 consolidated revenue of $585 million was up 3% on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis, when compared to the first quarter of 2013. ","Operating margin was 26%, down slightly from 26.3% in the first quarter of 2013. Diluted earnings per share attributable to Equifax was $0.67 per share. Excluding acquisition related amortization, adjusted EPS was $0.89 up from $0.87 in the first quarter 2013. ","Moving to the individual business units, our U.S. Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $244 million, essentially flat when compared to the first quarter of 2013. Our core non-mortgage market organic growth, including strategic initiatives contributed approximately 6% to growth, although decline in mortgage market volumes subtracted 6% from growth.","Online Consumer Information Solutions revenue was $179 million, up 2%. Core credit decisioning transaction volume was up 9%, while average revenue per transaction declined 8%. The decline in revenue per transaction resulted from fewer mortgage related transactions, which are typically at higher than average per transaction and from expansion that select larger financial institutions in Telco\u2019s, which have lower than average pricing due to their size. ","Mortgage solutions revenue of $24 million was down 18% compared to the fist quarter of 2013. This compares very favorably to the mortgage bankers application index, which is down 54% in the first quarter. ","Consumer financial marketing services revenue was $41 million, up 3% when compared to the year ago quarter and the operating margin for U.S. Consumer Information Solutions was 38.9% up from 37.5% in the first quarter of 2013. ","Our international business unit\u2019s revenue was $144 million, up 16% on a reported basis and up 24% on a local currency basis. The acquisitions we that completed in the fourth quarter and first quarter contributed approximately 15 percentage points at the local currency growth. Strong organic growth was aided by above average growth in small and medium enterprises, government insurance and utilities.","By region, Europe\u2019s revenue was $66 million, up 48% in U.S. dollars and up 39% in local currency, driven by the acquisition of TDX and upper single digit organic growth in our core business. Latin America\u2019s revenue is $47 million, flat in U.S. dollars, but up 23% in local currency, driven about equally by organic growth in technology and analytic services, marketing services and by the acquisitions in Paraguay and Mexico.","Canada consumer information revenue was $31 million, down 4% in U.S. dollars, but up 5% in local currency, driven primarily by solid growth in information solutions and technology and analytical services. ","International\u2019s operating margin was 20.4% compared to 28.1% in 2013. Approximately half of the decline resulted from the increased acquisition related amortization expense of $5.8 million related to producing acquisitions. The remaining decline resulted from seasonality in our newly acquired TDX business and inflation driven pressures on margin in Argentina. We expect to exit the year with operating margin over 25%.","Workforce Solutions revenue was $120 million for the quarter, down 3% when compared to the first quarter in 2013. Verification Services with revenue of $64 million was down 7% when compared to the same quarter in 2013. Strong growth in government and pre-employment partially offset the 31% decline in mortgage-related revenues. Revenue in our non-mortgage customer segments was up 16%. ","Employer Services revenue was $56 million, up 1% compared to last year. The Workforce Solutions overall operating margin was 32.3% compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2013, driven primarily by the benefit of reduced acquisition amortization, offset partially by the negative effect of lower revenue against the primarily fixed cost expense base. ","North America Personal Solutions revenue was $54 million, up 6%. Growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of TrustedID. Solid mid single digit growth in U.S. subscription revenues and strong growth in Canada were largely offset by declining revenue in breach and transaction products. ","Operating margin for Personal Solutions was 28.2% compared to 28.4% in the first quarter a year ago. North American Commercial Solutions revenue was $23 million, flat on a reported basis and up 2% on a local currency basis, driven by growth in transaction revenue, partially offset by weakness in project oriented revenues. The operating margin was 19.4% compared to 21.3% in the year ago quarter.","Now, let me turn it back to Rick.","Rich Smith","Thanks Lee. Before we go to Q&A, I thought I\u2019ll just give you a couple of thoughts front up and how we think about the remainder of 2014 and how we think about \u2013 our overviews of 2015. One, our core organic non-mortgage market growth of 6% to 8% we talked about for a number of years remains solid and we continue to make great progress on all of our initiatives, to ensure we deliver in that range as we did in the first quarter. ","Secondly, the integration of the acquisitions we\u2019re talking about are on track and we\u2019re more optimistic about the potential for TDX and Inffinix together with different markets than at the of the acquisition and these acquisitions are expected to move, to be accretive towards the back end of this year.","Three, as we talked about in the largely through the mortgage headwinds, that will start to abate as we exit the second quarter and continue to abate in the third quarter and put it in the fourth quarter and they are coming back in 2014. ","At this point the foreign exchange headwinds we\u2019re talking about and we\u2019re probably getting more, seeing some stability there and when we put that all together it says that at this juncture, versus the fourth quarter earnings call that we did, Lee and I would be more confident in the outlook for the balance of this year and 2015 as we still have time. We still have to execute obviously as a company. ","As was always, we reconfirm our full year guidance; we gave it in the last call. We expect core organic non-mortgage to grow there in the 6% to 8% acquisition added to our growth to our FX and mortgage will continue to be headwinds and going through the second quarter and the early third quarter very much as we expected, which is encouraging.","We should expect the total, revenue for he total year to be $2.425 billion and $2.475 billion and our adjusted EPS as we told you in the last call between $2.75 a share and $2.89 a share. In the second quarter we expect reported revenue between $606 million and $619 million and adjusted EPS between $0.92 and $0.95, so very much in line with what we\u2019ve expected from the year.","So with that operator we\u2019d like to open up the phones for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go to our first question with Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning guys. So I wanted to \u2013 Rick there\u2019s a lot of things your throwing out in terms of initiatives that are taking place and I just wanted to parse it a little bit, when we think about this conviction going into the second half and I guess what I\u2019m trying to figure out is, how much of the benefit really needs to be kind of cyclical and then the second part is, versus what I would consider to be kind of contractual obligations or what your seeing kind of spool up in all of your new products. I\u2019m just trying to split those two a bit.","Rick Smith ","Yes, it\u2019s tough to quantify the exact breakup. But let me give you some color around it Dan. One, vertical markets, the we\u2019ve doing, and have been doing that for a couple of years, focus on verticals like autos, for example insurance, Telco are very more frequently anticipate just a few months ago, a few quarters ago, that\u2019s number one. ","Number two, like we mentioned the acquisitions that we have, which are great strategically and they become accretive a the back end of year, that helps us. ","And two, the mortgage market, as I said before, is abating almost as expected. So it really comes down to continuing to do the things that the group has been doing for a number of years now, focusing on customers needs, bundling price together in a unique way to solve this problem and executing on a high level. That combined with a little bit of market help. ","I think the economy will start to improve, we\u2019re seeing it in some of data right now in many parts of the world., is that the economy is improving; that helps us as well.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and then on the home equity lending side, you know that sounds like something that\u2019s new and could be meaningful. When we think about that, I guess how fast are you seeing that kind of pace or play now and is that something that also gives you some confidence as you think about second half and just, I want to be clear where that falls in the P&L. Is that in verification services or is that up in somewhere else. Thanks.","Rick Smith ","Great question Dan. Its early stages and I\u2019m very encouraged. We saw some nice volume in the end of the first quarter, we expect that to continue in the second quarter. So I think you'll see that home equity is right at the historical numbers in home equity loans in the marketplace. You\u2019ll see us returning closer to more normal levels versus the fresh levels we\u2019ve had last four or five years. As far as where it shows up, it predominantly shows up in our EWS business and verification of employment and income.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, and then just a last one, congratulations on renewing the CMS deal. But now we\u2019ve got some framework for numbers around that. Should we come to expect that the contractual minimums is something that is just the jumping off point and you guys should earn a lot more of that revenue possibly into \u201914. Thanks, I\u2019ll jump off.","Rick Smith ","Yes, sure I hope so Dan. Thank you for you for the congratulations on the renewal. Dan Adams is a doing a heck of a job with CMS for the last 18 months is secure, has been re-secured. There\u2019s a lot of noise in this, and frontline of 8 million people who have signed up and you should think about it around the contractual minimums at this point and as far as ramp up you know I expect that in 2015, not 2014.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you.","Rick Smith ","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. I think we talked about that IHS JV that you said it was your first product. Can you just elaborate on that? Is there potentially more products in the pipeline with them. Thank you.","Rick Smith ","Yes, thanks Paul. Yes, it\u2019s pretty cool. Lee and his team have been working with Polk, a standalone company for a number of years now and the good news is post IHS acquisition of Polk the doors have continued to remain open. The see us a unique provider of solutions for the automotive vertical, they know this is a unique focus for us.","So we've already had a couple, I mentioned one on the call which is the lost sales analysis, which is really, its helps the underwriters of risk understand why they lost the risk, how to place the risk, where the ultimate buyer ends up going and why and how they might reposition the next offering better to reduce churn of loss sales. ","That is one of the many products that we are currently working with IHS on. And again, I think that\u2019s an example. Maybe goes back to Dan\u2019s question of what\u2019s different, is when we restructure a company we want deep execution on different verticals like auto. You get intimate with that industry and you understand their needs and challenges. So our ability to bundle our new products is so important now and so much more effective than it would have been and that sales analysis with IHS is one example.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank","Great. If I could just ask a follow-up to Lee. Lee, any way to give us what the total acquired revs were in the first quarter, and what the rough range would be for the second quarter?","Lee Adrean","I don\u2019t know about the dollars, but the growth was about 4%, contributed 4% to growth, so it would be roughly 4% against last year\u2019s revenue, that\u2019s in the low 20\u2019s. That will actually step up some in the second quarter, because we\u2019ll have a full quarter on TEX and also just the effective acquisition accounting. When you first do an acquisition you loose some of the differed revenue that the acquired company may have and that tends to affect the first period the most and then diminish over time. So you\u2019ll see a somewhat bigger effect on growth in the second quarter. There is about 4% in Q1 and the next quarter the growth and contribution is probably more like 5%.","Rick Smith ","If I remember the mortgage headwind cost us about six points relative to this quarter, is that right?","Lee Adrean","Yes, and probably something roughly similar in the second quarter. It really doesn\u2019t start and then it falls off in the third and fourth quarter to much smaller impacts.","Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from George Mihalos from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","George Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the solid quarter. I just wanted to dig in on the international side a little bit. Canada seemed to really accelerate from the fourth quarter. I just wonder what\u2019s driving that and then also it seems to me that Europe constant currency slowed a little bit. Is there anything going on there or are there any sort of variations that will sort of play out throughout the course of the year.","Rick Smith ","Yes, there is nothing unusual on either side that is either drawing optimism or concern, you got some seasonality in both areas. As I look at the long term forecast for both Europe, excluding Russia, but Europe is a little solid performance outperforming the marketplace growing at multiple of GDP. I see it continuing, but I don\u2019t see anything that is really unusual either on the upside or for the downside in that geography.","Lee Adrean","And George I would add two things. One, on Canada we have had continued good success with our technology and analytical services offerings. We also saw a little bit stronger growth in just our traditional online credit reporting in the first quarter and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any predictability to that. It will strengthen or weaken a little bit from time to time. I think Canada continues to be in the low to mid single digit kind of core organic growth trend.","On Europe you know, we\u2019ve been indicating that last year it tended to run at very high single digits on organic growth, but looking at a very relatively stagnant U.K. economy and the weak Spain economy reflected just great performance in growth on our part, but we\u2019ve been flagging. That could moderate a little bit and I think that\u2019s what we saw, that it continues to perform well across a number of product and customer segments.","Rick Smith ","Yes, I think the organic growth in Europe is about 8%.","Lee Adrean","7%.","Rick Smith ","7% for the quarter, so we think that those two economies, that continue to be fully processed.","George Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay great, that\u2019s very helpful. And just one more question Lee, the general corporate expenses were down considerably year-on-year. What\u2019s driving that and how should we think about that line item going forward as it compares to your revenue growth. Thank you.","Lee Adrean","The corporate line in addition to having certain of the corporate staff expenses, which tend to be pretty stable, include the number of activities that are project related, discretionary, certain investments that we make that are corporate wide and that line can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. It was down year-over-year in the first quarter, which would not be the normal trend. I would say that you should expect for the year, that the corporate line will be up, but by less than revenue, but you will see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we have seen some times in the past.","George Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. ","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Hey Rick, I want to focus a little bit more on the super scores. It seems to me that if I look over the last kind of seven years or so at Equifax, went through a period of focusing more on buying unique assets and then a period of kind of I guess that\u2019s you are still in, in terms of integrating the different assets and it seems like the end game or at least part of the end game should be coming up with a lot more of these super scores in areas where your competitors can\u2019t do that. Can you talk about where \u2013 which verticals do you feel like you have that in and where you think you have a lot of potential and how important that is for kind of the strategic revenue growth of the business overall?","Rick Smith ","Yes, good question. As I think about the tenants, the long-term growth for the company, kind of new area source and talking to you in the past about fraud and ID, prevention as being one, we talked about analytical solutions being another. So clearly we\u2019re investing in a very heavy rate. We brought a great guy in, who's steeped in his understanding of and developing of analytical products. He's done analytics for Hewlett-Packard and he has been for about a year now. ","So one, having the focus and the talent around analytics, and two, having the unique data assets available to build those new analytics and insights. I think we\u2019re in a pretty good position, so its clearly a place where we have been and will continue to make a bet on investments in because I think we are uniquely positioned because of our unique data assets.","As far as verticals, its going to start off with the verticals where we think we\u2019re uniquely positioned with our unique dated assets, automotive is one, mortgage is one, Telco is one, insurance is one. To start with those are the key areas we can start and maybe also (Inaudible).","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","How far along do you feel you are in terms of coming out with some of these super scores? Do you feel like there\u2019s lot of open terrain in front of you?","Rick Smith ","I do for one primary reason we have developed some technical capabilities that maybe was to \u2013 maybe write the data in different ways than we could before, to do it real-time and do it cost-efficiently. Those capabilities have started late last year, early this year that continue to be the third quarter and I expect us to be in position where we can run a much faster rate, in an economical way in the fourth quarter this year. It's early days but very encouraging days.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Okay, great. Just jumping back to the ACA question, are you seeing these amount of sign ups actually flowing through and kind of hitting your numbers in terms of expanding the revenue for you guys?","Rick Smith ","Yes, yes, great question. To make sure I understand it, I\u2019ll expand on time the differences. We have a analytical capability that builds a company. They said give us all of your data and with that data we can analyze and tell if your complying with Affordable Care Act. Two revenue streams that have been important to acknowledge; one is we charge those hundred plus companies for that analytical solution. ","Secondly, in many cases those companies that were using our platform, our analytics have not been Work Number contributors in the past. So we use this platform, analytics platform to not only solve their problem. But in many cases added a Work Number database, which has exceeded our expectations so far and so the monetization of that is once you get on the database, people start hitting that database, looking for verification and for an income and you know if those record, cost records looks like there. ","So there\u2019s two revenue streams. The latter, Work Number database lags obviously you get it at the end, cleansed and people start hitting it, project revenues is more immediate.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","What about the substance coming from the government? I\u2019m trying to understand, there\u2019s a big number that the government put out and just if you do some machinations around them, I\u2019m trying to figure out, based on the levels of sign ups and where your seeing the revenue flow, they hit the quarterly $50 million, $60 million year potential that contract would imply. ","Rick Smith ","Okay great question, and again the governments proclaimed 7 million to 8 million people that have signed up. There is so much more, in those numbers than you\u2019ve expected. So again you can find that many of those people are retired people, so there\u2019s more people on the record at this juncture. ","So we are not seeing \u2013 I think someone asked the question earlier. If you think about 2014, think more in the framework of the minimum security by CMS and my hope is if this thing ramps up in 2015 and beyond, you\u2019ll see revenues move well beyond the minimums, its too early to claim that now. So as I said in the past calls, as we more and more get smarter to see what\u2019s occurring in the market place you guys will be the first to know. ","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Okay if I can, I want to squeeze in one. I want to ask a housekeeping one for Lee. You purchased a 0.4 million shares, the share account still went up a little bit. Is there a kind of a timing difference, is it a stock price or issuance in the equity timing. How should we think of that in terms of repurchases? ","Lee Adrean","Yes, I haven\u2019t looked at it quite that closely. But we probably need to buy between 1 million and 1.25 million shares over the course of the year to offset the effected equity compensation. I have the average shares that could be timing. I don\u2019t know have it right in front of me, the ending shares. My guess is the ending shares many have come down just slightly. But the average shares would be affected when it comes to that timing. We would have been buying relatively late in the quarter, because of the timing of our year-end earnings release. So its probably a function of timing and the effect on weighted average shares. ","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to our next question from David Togut with Evercore.","","Rena Kumar \u2013 Evercore","Good morning. This is Rena Kumar for David Togut. You discussed a lot of your new products in your opening remarks. Can you just call out which of your new products made the biggest contribution to revenue in the quarter? ","Rick Smith ","I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, but again you got to put it in perspective. We launched anywhere from 15 to 75 new products every year. Have been so for about seven years, so its truly broad based. We don\u2019t typically look at or get what you call home runs with products. In total it ends up being a significant number of goals. As you know there\u2019s a vitality mix of 10% and 11% coming from possibly just three years ago. So it tends to be a bunch of singles and doubles and it\u2019s truly in almost every geography we have around the world. ","Lee Adrean","I can give a couple of examples, some of the bigger categories. The products that we have developed from the Telco positive database are relatively larger products that have developed in the mortgage base, taking advantages of our additional sources of data. We\u2019re bringing some of our technology decision in platforms much more broadly across our international space, and there we have high-end platforms and low-end platforms depending on the size and sophistication of our customers. ","Some of the things we\u2019ve down with identity authentication are another one of the larger categories that we\u2019ve brought out. So those are a couple of the product families that have been the most significantly over the last year. ","Rick Smith ","And just \u2013 that\u2019s a good point Lee. For your benefit, those categories have been largely consistent, not just this first quarter, but as you said the last year or two, that\u2019s an area of focus. ","Kumar \u2013 Evercore","Great, and if you can just discuss your current acquisition pipeline. ","Rick Smith ","Yes, at this juncture we are really focused on integrating TDX, Inffinix, Paraguay and taking strategically the Inffinix and TDX platforms as I mentioned earlier to different geography. I think that\u2019s a key to the business occupying for quite some time. ","For M&A, we continue to look at M&A. We\u2019re focused more on strategic tuck-ins than there are large deals and so it\u2019ll always be an important part of our strategy. There\u2019s noting that\u2019s imminent to talk about this juncture. ","Rena Kumar \u2013 Evercore","Thank you. ","Rick Smith "," ","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Nikitas from Robert Baird.","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co","Yes, thanks for taking the question. You mentioned continued expectations from mortgage improvement. I think last quarter you guys quantified your MBA expectations. Could you put a number on that for 2Q if possible? ","Rick Smith ","Let me speak from memory. Maybe you have that later Jeff. We talked about \u2013 the MBA was \u2013 talked about being done probably in the first half of the year, modestly in the second half of the year, total year down by 30% for the year. Second quarter will improve over first quarter is it is down 15%. It maybe down 20% to 30% for the second quarter. Does that sound about right. ","Lee Adrean","My word of caution on the MBA industry is that we have had difficultly over time tightly correlating our revenue growth, but even some of the flow of closed mortgage loans with the MBA industries. There\u2019s a lot of different sources for data. You can look at different economists and they forecast different things. So there is a lot attention on the MBA indices. Its as good an index as others, but the correlation is a little loose. So be careful about using that as our \u2013 a benchmark for our revenue. ","Rick Smith ","Does someone known what the published MBA is? ","Lee Adrean","The Q2 forecast? ","Rick Smith ","The trend is everyone is expecting mortgage in general, beyond MBA. The mortgage market in the second quarter was a modestly better than the first quarter.","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co","Okay, that helps. And you mentioned the NPI 2.0 introductions. Could you just talk more about what your doing differently there and then just in general the pipeline for that product line. ","Rick Smith ","Yes, I think it\u2019s more of a process than a product line. NPI was launched seven years ago and after we\u2019ve waited for seven years, it runs the risk of becoming somewhat stale, when the entitlement sets in. ","So its just our way of reenergizing, redefining the parameters on NPI, think about NPI. How you get new ideas in from clients and working with VC firms and Silicon Valley firms. Just to continue to make sure we got great ideas coming through the funnel. So its our way of reenergizing it and we started it late last year and its off to a great start. My hope is that this keeps the energy around NPI going for another four, five years. ","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co","Okay, great, and just one last one for me. You talked about the vitality index in the past three-year contribution mix. I think previously you said that international sees a large benefit from that. Any other segments where you\u2019re kind of running above that 10% run rate? Is it pretty spread out across all of them? ","Rick Smith ","It will ebb and flow, because sometimes you\u2019ll have large products in one particular venue that will run off in a particular year, so its accounted. The last four years, as you get into the fourth year, we\u2019re counted as part of the core to them, not the vitality. So every business unit will have its ups and downs if they have a good product launch in any one given year, so. ","Nick Nikitas - Robert W. Baird & Co","Okay, great. Thanks. ","Rick Smith ","Good.","Operator","We\u2019ll go ahead to our next question with Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","Hey, good morning everybody. The first around the sort of new product and the partnerships you talked about. So firstly you know you mentioned auto obviously is a key vertical. You are partnering with IHS Polk. I was just wondering, over the longer term like what your appetite for acquisitions in that area is with respect to sort of building out that capability. And just around partnerships, I know you mentioned HIS. I was just wondering you guys had an announcement teaming up with CoreLogic as well. I was wondering you know how significant or incremental could that be? ","Rick Smith ","As far as acquisitions, we\u2019ll obviously look. At this juncture as outlook is specifically auto to answer your question. A key focus here for us, I think we\u2019ve assembled unique data assets that we need to succeed there. I think we\u2019ve assembled the right partners and there are a number of key partners who have capability in the pipes into the automotive industry that they see the value we bring and we see the value they bring. ","They tend to look towards commercial agreements versus hard core JVs at this juncture. I don\u2019t see we need to do anything on the M&A front, because that obviously may change. I think we can do as we have been doing and be quite successful. ","As far as CoreLogic, I\u2019m not going to break that out. The partnerships are important to us as we get into verticals and vertical focus, to find people like CoreLogic who are very good in a particular spacing and we\u2019re going to bring value and do bring value. It\u2019s a win-win situation. So we are not going to quantity the size of that. ","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","Fair enough. Your not quantifying it, but would that be an added lever in terms of offsetting the market growth more than what you already are doing. ","Rick Smith ","Yes, I think so. I think you think of any time we can find it, it will bring value to the mortgage market that we couldn\u2019t bring in the past. That\u2019s offset the revenues, yes. ","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","Okay, and then Lee just on the margin side, I was just wondering if you\u2019d help us sort of cover the things out. So on the corporate expense line you said the total year number should be I guess higher than the 2013 number and you said less than growth. I\u2019m guessing up 10% or so. I just wanted to see if you give us a little more specificity there. And then on the international side, I think you said exit the year at 25%. I just wanted to clarify that meant the full year number should be 25% or just the fourth quarter should be the 25%? ","Lee Adrean","On the corporate expense I would expect that they growth probably in the range of 4% or 5%, although again that can change as we make decisions through the year on various projects and initiatives we want to undertake, but my current expectations would be, we might be looking at 4%, 5% growth for the year. ","In international, that 25% probably a reasonable number for the second half, but that\u2019s not a full year number, that\u2019s a half number. Particularly as we get TDX integrated, recognizing the seasonality of its business, as well as we get through the period where we\u2019re running off or is not able to recognize their past differed revenue, just give a nature lift in what TDX is contributing. ","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","And then for the second quarter international is similar to the first quarter? ","Lee Adrean","Probably a little bit better, but we\u2019re still below where we would expect it to be over time. ","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","Okay and just one last one, I don\u2019t know if I remember this, but in terms of the CMS minimums that you talked about that, have you guys disclosed that before? ","Rick Smith ","I think we have. Jeff, hope you \u2013 have you given the numbers? Yes, we though that that number is around $8 million to $10 million. "," ","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","Okay, all right, thanks a lot guys. ","Rick Smith ","Thank you. Okay, with that I\u2019d like to thank everybody for their interest and support in Equifax and with that operator we\u2019ll conclude the call. ","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Jeff Dodge, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional and closing remarks. ","Jeffrey Dodge","No, there are none. Thank you.","Operator","All right, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Dodge. Please go ahead.","Jeff Dodge","Thanks and good morning. Welcome to today's conference call. I'm Jeff Dodge with Investor Relations; and with me today are Rick Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Gamble, Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Brandberg with Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. An archive of the recording will be available later today in the Investor Relations section in the About Equifax's tab of our website at www.equifax.com.","During this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements to help you understand Equifax and its business environment. These statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Certain risk factors inherent in our business set forth in filings with the SEC, including our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent filings.","Also, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax and adjusted EBITDA margin, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability and the underlying operational performance. For the second quarter of 2017, adjusted EPS attributable to Equifax excludes acquisition-related amortization expense and the income tax effects of stock awards recognized upon vesting or settlement.","Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as net income attributable to Equifax, adding back income tax expense, interest expense, net of interest income and depreciation and amortization. These non-GAAP measures are detailed in reconciliation tables, which are included with our earnings release and are also posted on our website. Please also refer to our various investor presentations, which are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website for further details.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Thanks again for joining us for our call. The second quarter was another solid, broad-based performance by the team. Revenue performance at USIS, Workforce Solutions and International was very strong in the quarter with all 3 units meeting or exceeding our expectations. Global Consumer revenue was weaker-than-expected, which I'll discuss later. Overall revenue performance for the quarter was strong and within our expectations, even though the FX headwind was stronger-than-expected.","Adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS performance were both very strong in the quarter. Both were better than our expectations. Strong revenue growth and very high margin, USIS and EWS Verifier and in Canada and Argentina led to the strong margin and profit performance.","The performance we have coming out of the second quarter positions us very well for the second half of 2017. Total revenue for the quarter was $857 million, up 6% on a reported basis and up 7% on a local-currency basis when compared to second quarter 2016.","For the quarter, FX created about almost approximately $10 million of year-over-year headwind, which is more than we had expected. Revenue for the quarter adjusted for the higher FX impact, again, was within our expectations. The adjusted EBITDA margin was very strong at 39.1%, which is up 250 basis points over a year ago with very good expansion across all of our business units. Adjusted EPS was also very strong at $1.60, up 12% year-over-year. As I always do, I'll jump into some BU activities and come back to some corporate highlights and then turn it over to John.","Let me start with USIS. They delivered a strong 8% revenue growth in the quarter, up from 5% in the first quarter. We delivered a stronger growth despite a weaker mortgage market in the second quarter. The growth was broad based in the Marketing Services business at 15% growth was very strong. This reflects both new products and our expanding capabilities driven by Cambrian analytics, and the new delivery platforms we've talked to you about in the past. Adjusted EBITDA margin performance was very good, up over 100 basis points from 2016 coming in at 51.5%.","Last quarter, we announced Ignite, our portfolio of data and analytics solutions powered by our Cambrian platform. Customer reception of our Ignite portfolio of solutions has been extremely positive. Ignite's capabilities are comprehensive and enable a full range of offerings from predefined to configurable to highly customized solutions that again leverage Equifax's broad and unique data assets, including trended data.","We're incorporating trended data and other unique data into additional scores and insights for multiple verticals within our Ignite portfolio. Combination of Equifax Ignite and trended data in one platform is powerful in many ways, including allowing our customers to create their own trended attributes and use those along with our unique data in their custom models.","Our solutions enable customers to create unique analysis through simple configuration of an extremely wide range of parameters, including things like data assets utilized, risk score type, peer group period, update frequency and segmentation. Ignite is used not only to develop new models, but also to continually validate predictiveness of existing models. Both our Ignite Direct and Marketplace solutions are resonating with our customers. Ignite will be deployed everywhere we deploy Cambrian. By the end of next year, we'll be in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Argentina, Chile, Peru, U.S. and Canada. It's still early days, but Ignite is ramping up nicely and being very well received. We're excited about the meaningful medium- and long-term opportunity for our Cambrian platform and our Ignite portfolio solutions.","Staying in USIS. Last quarter, we discussed our launch of InstaTouch mobile solution. InstaTouch provides a simple method to verify the identity of the user of a mobile device and for the user to access Equifax data assets easily and securely pre-populate personal identity and payment information into an application or complete a purchase, improving the conversion rate and reducing the abandonment rate because the friction has been reduced. We're deployed with a major financial institution and expect significant expansion opportunities and new customers over the remainder of 2017 and 2018.","While this product is led by USIS, this also has tremendous application in Workforce Solutions employer services, also in Global Consumer and International. So said another way, InstaTouch will be a platform we're deploying around the world.","As InstaTouch leverages our global decision platform InterConnect, which you're familiar with, it can be deployed globally, taking advantage of that infrastructure. A great example of leveraging the NPI process and our global IT infrastructure to accelerate product development and revenue. Onto Workforce Solutions. They continue to deliver strong performance with 10% revenue growth in the quarter. The team continues to make great progress penetrating key verticals, introducing innovative new solutions and expanding the business model beyond the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA margins continue to expand, up 100 basis points to over 51%.","Verifier grew a very strong 19% in the second quarter despite weaker mortgage activity for the quarter. The strategy is hitting on all cylinders as the team executes on a number of initiatives, which are driving a record level of additions to The Work Number database.","Performance in the second quarter was very broad-based with strong growth across government, card, preemployment screening, auto and mortgage. Last quarter, we told you about our progress towards launching a Workforce Solutions business in Canada. In May, we launched our verification of income, verification of employment and record of employment solutions in Canada. We have a growing list of clients across multiple verticals, including government, consumer finance, mortgage, auto and background screening. Just like in the U.S., the strategic focus in Canada is on record acquisition, adding verifiers and a network effect that, that creates. We're now receiving records from several large employers, and we're making very good progress in adding more employers and more records. As some of you know, lending practices in Canada, particularly in mortgage, have come under increased scrutiny recently. We're furthering our market leadership position with the launch of our income and employment solutions in Canada. It's come to a good time for us and for our customers. We're more focused now than ever on improving the quality of their underwriting decisions and minimizing fraud.","Speaking of Workforce Solutions, beyond the U.S. is a great example of our enterprise growth initiative process that we've talked to you about for years now. We often use, as you know, for more complex initiatives that cut across multiple business units and\/or geographies. The Workforce Solutions business model is very attractive and a great addition to our core financial information services businesses around the world.","The global opportunity here is significant. We have a leadership team with an experience and in-depth understanding of how to make that happen, a good technology platform and working diligently right now in Australia and the UK In longer term, there are additional geographies beyond Canada, UK and Australia that we hope to take Workforce Solutions to.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue performance in the first half of 2017 saw some significant annual customer delivery shift between the first and second quarters, as we discussed with you in April. As such, to gauge performance, we need to look at the total first half versus the individual quarters. At 2% local currency growth for the first half, performance is weaker than our long-term range of 5% to 8% in our previous guidance. As we've discussed, Equifax recognized the shift occurring in the U.S. consumer market several years ago as new entrants, including those with lead generation-based business models entered the market. We've broadened our strategy to embrace those new channels and partners and the expansion into new geographies as we do across our B2B businesses and performed extremely well, exceeding our growth targets.","Our long-term growth targets reflect the expectation of a softer U.S. pay consumer market. GCS will deliver 5% to 8% growth in this environment through a four pronged approach: number one, expansion of partnerships with these new entrants as well as traditional players; number two, expansion into new geographies with paid offerings where Equifax's unique data will allow sustainable growth; number three, expansion of channels to reach consumers in the U.S. and other markets where Equifax's unique data assets and relationships provide a competitive advantage; and four, NPI, driving new products based on Equifax's unique data assets like our tax fraud product and additional credit identity protection or warning and breach products in our NPI pipeline.","We've executed well on the partnership expansion. We're making good progress on the geographic and channel expansion and also on NPI, but the progress was somewhat slower than we expected in the first half. Our confidence in the ultimate success of these initiatives, however, is unchanged. However, the slower progress has negatively impacted revenue performance in the first half of 2017. And as we go into the third quarter of 2017, we expect revenue for GCS to be likely approximately flat when compared to 2016 of third quarter. However, we are expecting to see improving growth in Q4 2017 with GCS getting back into their long-term range of 5% to 8% growth leading also to a stronger 2018.","International delivered another impressive quarter, delivering 10% local currency revenue growth with strong performance on new product initiatives that are performing well above our targets. International also delivered 250 basis points of margin expansion through both strong growth in our higher margin countries and continued focus on cost management and our ongoing program to consolidate global functions. Europe had another strong quarter with 12% local currency revenue growth. The debt management business in the UK continues to be a growth driver, as we broaden our relationship with the UK government.","Collections performance continues to be -- continues to improve, and the outcomes are ahead of our expectations. Additionally, the amount of debt placed remained robust in the second quarter, and we have a strong pipeline of additional new business opportunities with both new and existing customers. Our core financial data business in the UK and Spain also saw a good growth in the quarter, driven by Decision Solutions growth, reflecting our accelerating growth in deployments of our global interconnect and EID platforms through both expansion in existing and winning new customers.","Our Asia-Pacific business grew 4% in local currency and was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our acquired Veda business grew at over 5% in the quarter with a nice adjusted EBITDA margin performance above 35%. In the second quarter 2016 in Australia, we delivered a large onetime project that drove significant revenue in the year-ago period, impacting the year-over-year growth this quarter. We're expecting to see good acceleration of growth in the second half of 2017 starting in the third quarter with overall organic growth for the period in high-single digits.","As we announced last month, Paulino Barros has moved to city to become President of Equifax Asia-Pacific. Paulino delivered great results as President of our International business and most recently, our USIS business. We're confident with Paulino in place, we'll see successful implementation of our critical management disciplines of NPI, EGI and Lean over the coming years as well as quickly restarting our focus on M&A in that region. Latin America had another impressive quarter with 14% local currency growth. Growth continues to be broad-based and led by outstanding performance in our largest countries in the region. We continue to expand our technology capabilities in the region and we're on track to deploy InterConnect and Cambrian across the region within the next year.","Team in Latin America delivered strong results on New Product Innovation with NPI revenues more than 20% ahead of our second quarter targets. Canada had a very strong quarter with local currency growth in the second quarter of 8% and over 9% growth for the first half of the year. Team is driving improved new product innovation, accelerated by their implementation of Cambrian and those new solutions are resonating well with our customers and help us continue to drive share gain in a market where we already have very high share. Canada had several nice wins in the quarter, including a contract with a large financial institution to provide unique Lean monitoring solutions for auto loans, which helps reconcile vehicle registration data with Equifax credit reporting data to ensure the integrity of the Lean throughout the life cycle. Before I hand it over to John, let me make a few comments at the corporate level, and then John will get into the financial details.","First, our NPI portfolio continues to perform very well. The performance is broad-based across business units and verticals. NPI revenues and our vitality Index were nicely above our expectations for the second quarter and for the first half of the year. Number of products launched year-to-date were up 36% over 2016; and our pipeline of products, which we were talking about in the past, is up 45% over 2016. Both those metrics bode well for the end of 2017 and 2018 and beyond.","We continue to realize significant value on our Lean initiatives across our business units and geographies. In the second quarter and for the first half of the year, we exceeded our Lean target by more than 20%, with the portfolio of Lean initiatives for every business unit performing ahead of our expectations. We continue -- we expect continued strong execution in the second half of the year. Lean is a fundamental process to drive both revenue and operating efficiencies, and you continue to see the team's execution and focus reflected in our top line growth as well as our margin expansion that you're seeing over the past few years.","Client Lean where our teams work directly with customers at their locations this year, our Lean expertise to help our customers solve problems, has also had a great and strong first half of 2017. Increasingly, Cambrian Ignite is becoming a tool for our client Lean teams as we help our customers accelerate their ability to utilize Cambrian in their own process improvement initiatives.","Last quarter, I briefly discussed the importance of enterprise vertical and alliance strategy and its importance in driving revenue growth across USIS and Workforce Solutions. You will see continued integration of delivery channels across USIS and Workforce as we move throughout 2017 and 2018, including significant expansion of third party partner relationships. This is a significant focus of our investment in 2017. Enterprise vertical and alliance strategy is also a driver of growth in GCS, partnering with Workforce Solutions to expand customer access.","In summary, our performance in second quarter and the first half of 2016 has been very strong with first half local currency revenue growth of 11% and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. Equifax continues to demonstrate a consistent performance delivered by our focus on and continuous improvement of our critical growth processes of EGI, NPI, Alliances and Lean. Equifax has the most uniquely data in our industry, and we're building on our leadership position in the U.S. and around the world.","We're uniquely positioned to turn data into actual insights through leading-edge technology and data and analytics capabilities. The opportunities in front of us are simply tremendous, and a high level of execution gives me confidence as I look ahead to the second half of 2017 and 2018 and beyond.","And with that, let me turn it over to John for the financials, and I'll come back with some guidance and full year color. John?","John Gamble","Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As before, I will generally be referring to the financial results from continuing operations represented on a GAAP basis. We had a solid 2Q and first half, which puts us on a good path to deliver 2017. Revenue adjusted for FX was within our expectations, and adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS were very strong and well ahead of our expectations.","USIS revenue in 2Q '17 was $332 million, up 8% when compared to the second quarter of 2016. This is very strong when considering the impact of the decline in overall mortgage market increase. Online Information Solutions revenue was $233 million, up 6% when compared to the year ago period. Online Information Solutions reflect double digit growth in Identity and Fraud Solutions and telecommunications revenues. The 6% growth in Online Information Solutions represents very nice acceleration from 1Q growth despite the impact of a weaker mortgage market in 2Q.","Mortgage market increase weakened in 2Q versus 1Q, declining in the high single-digit percentages in the second quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. Total market-related revenue for Equifax -- total mortgage-market related revenue for Equifax was up 13%. We continue to expect a significant decline in mortgage market inquiries in 2017, but we now expect the decline to be somewhat less for the full year than the 15% we had discussed in our 1Q earnings release. For 3Q '17, we expect the mortgage market to be down 10% to 15% year-to-year with a significant decline also expected for 4Q.","Financial Marketing Services revenue was $61 million in 2Q '17, up 15%. While revenue performance can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter due to project-related revenues in this segment, we were very pleased with our 2Q growth of 15%, which was up nicely on a sequential basis from 1Q. Performance was broad based within the segment, and we are encouraged with trends we are seeing. We saw strong double digit growth in both our traditional credit marketing services to financial institutions as well as double digit growth in our other marking-related revenue streams, including our unique asset and wealth database. Through the first half of the year, Financial Marketing Services revenue was up 9% compared to 4% in the first half of 2016.","The adjusted EBITDA margin for USIS was very strong 51.5%, up over 100 basis points from 50.4% in 2Q '16. As you remember, selling trended data reports to the mortgage industry on August of 2016. USIS revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in 3Q and 4Q '17 will be negatively impacted as we lap the launch of trended data in mortgage. Also, the expected 10% to 15% decline in overall mortgage market increase creates an approximately 400-basis-point headwind to USIS revenue growth in 3Q '17. Excluding these impacts, we would again expect USIS revenue to exceed our long-term range of 5% to 7%. Reflecting these impacts, we expect USIS revenue growth to be low single-digit percentage in 3Q '17.","For the year, USIS revenue is expected to be stronger than we previously expected, but still slightly below their long-term model of 5% to 7%, with this again driven by the headwinds created by the expected decline in overall mortgage market activity. Workforce Solutions revenue was $195 million in the quarter, up 10% when compared to 2Q 2016. Verification Services delivered a very strong quarter with revenue of $130 million, up 19%. Growth was broad-based with strong growth in government, card, pre-employment screening, auto and mortgage.","Our enterprise vertical strategy is working very well as our enterprise sales teams across USIS and Verification Services work together to penetrate markets and deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Combined revenue for USIS and Verification Services revenue was $462 million in the quarter, up 11%.","Employer Services revenue of $64 million declined 5% versus last year. Employer Services, excluding our Workforce Analytics business, grew over 7% in the quarter, driven by nice growth in several of our tax and compliance and on boarding solutions.","Workforce Analytics, our business that helps employers stay in compliance with Affordable Care Act, was down about 40% in 2Q '17. We mentioned in our last call that employers completed tax reporting for 1095s and 1094s much earlier in 2017 than they did in 2016, benefiting Workforce Analytics revenue in 1Q but creating a difficult comp in 2Q. Our revenue for Workforce Analytics has progressed in line with our expectations so far in 2017, down a little over 1% for the first half. We continue to expect our total ACA revenue to be about flat for 2017 versus 2016. Looking forward, we expect employer to grow high single-digit percent in the second half of 2017.","The Workforce Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin was a very strong 51.2% in 2Q '17, up 100 basis points from 50.2% in 2Q '16. This reflects continued strengthening of mix as high margin Verifier continues to grow aggressively as well as good cost control. Workforce Solutions grew at 10% was very strong, but down from 1Q '17 due to the significant timing-related decline in 2Q '17 Workforce Analytics revenue. As a result, we expect Workforce Solutions' overall growth to increase in the second half. For the full year, we expect continued strengthening of Workforce Solutions revenue at levels above our long-term model.","Global Consumer Solutions revenue at $99 million in 2Q '17 was down 8% on a reported basis and down 7% on a local currency basis. As we discussed in April, 1Q '17 revenue growth was benefited by more than 5 percentage points, as the timing of an expected annual purchase of data by our reseller partner occurred in 1Q '17 versus 2Q '16 in the prior year. Adjusted for this occurrence, GCS 1Q '17 revenue was up about 7% on a local-currency basis and 2Q '17 revenue was down just over 1% on a local-currency basis.","For the first half of 2017, local currency revenue is up about 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31% in 2Q '17 and was 31.4% for the first half. As Rick discussed, revenue performance was weaker-than-expected in 2Q and is performing below our full year expectation as growth on our geographic channel and NPI growth initiatives has been slower than we had planned. As a result, we expect GCS revenue to be about flat in 3Q '17 and for the full year to be below their long-term range of 5% to 8%. However, as Rick indicated, we do expect to exit 2017 with stronger growth rates and improve the growth again in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margins in GCS will decline sequentially in 3Q and rebound in 4Q.","International revenue was $231 million, up in 2Q '17, up 6% on a reported basis and up 10% on a local-currency basis. By region, Europe's revenue was $69 million in 2Q '17, up 2% in U.S. dollars and up 12% in local currency. Asia-Pacific revenue was $77 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency. This performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our acquired Veda assets grew at over 5% in the quarter, slightly below our long-term expectation, reflecting that in 2Q '16, Veda delivered a large onetime project, which drove significant revenue in the year ago period.","As Rick indicated, for second half of '17, we're expecting growth for Veda, we're expecting growth for Veda and high-single-digit growth overall for the nine months ending 2017. Latin America's revenue was $53 million in 2Q '17, up 13% in U.S. dollars and up 14% in local currency. Canada's revenue was $34 million, up 4% in U.S. dollars and up 8% in local currency.","International's adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.9% in 2Q '17, up from 28.4% a year ago. Margin expansion was outstanding and reflects the focused growth in high-margin products as well as continued execution on a long-term project to consolidate support services. For all of 2017, we continue to expect revenue growth for International to be above their long term 8% to 10% range.","In the quarter, general corporate expense was $48.1 million. For Equifax, adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.1% in 2Q '17, up 250 basis points from 2Q '16. This was an outstanding performance and reflected positive revenue mix across the BUs and within the BUs themselves and very good cost control in the BUs and centrally. Looking forward, we expect continued significant year-to-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin but not to the degree we saw in 2Q. Revenue mix is unlikely to be as positive as the overall mortgage market weakens and lower margin GCS revenue recovers. Timing of equity compensation grants increases variable compensation expense in 3Q. Investment spending related to EGIs and other significant programs increases in 3Q. This is mostly timing effect. And also, acquisition and integration cost will increase.","Our GAAP effective tax rate was 30.9% in the quarter and includes $4.8 million benefit from the income tax effect of stock awards. Excluding this item, our 2Q '17 effective tax rate would have been approximately 32.9%. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the full year is expected to be approximately 32.5% and somewhat below this level in 3Q '17. As a reminder, our non-GAAP effective tax rate in 3Q '16 was only 29.1% due to the benefit of discrete items. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue to see significant year-to-year expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin in 3Q '17, which will drive growth and operating income and adjusted EBITDA at a higher rate than revenue. However, items below operating income, principally the tax benefit in 3Q '16 as well as higher shares outstanding as we have not repurchased shares since the Veda acquisition, negatively impacts 3Q '17 adjusted EPS growth by about 4 percentage points. In 2Q '17, operating cash flow was $225 million and free cash flow was $176 million, both consistent with our expectations. Through June, operating cash flow was $329 million and free cash flow was $229 million, up 10% and 6% respectively.","Capital spending incurred in the quarter was $47 million. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion and our leverage was 2.32 times EBITDA. We raised cash in the commercial paper market in the last week of June to allow us to repay $272.5 million of bonds maturing in early July. Excluding the additional $272.5 million in commercial paper used to prefund the bond maturity, leverage would have been 2.1 times EBITDA. As we have delevered from the Veda acquisition consistent with our plans, we will restart share repurchases in 3Q. As Rick indicated, Equifax performance in first half of 2017 has been outstanding with local currency revenue up 11% and adjusted EPS up 14%. As Rick will describe shortly, for the full year, our expectations for both revenue and adjusted EPS are improving versus when we gave guidance in February. At that time, we expected the mortgage market to be down about 15%, principally in the back half of 2017, driven by increasing interest rates. We indicated that we would offset the overall 3% revenue headwind caused by the weakened mortgage market by accelerating new product innovation, accelerating growth in nonmortgage segments of USIS and Workforce Solutions, driven by product innovation as well as improved market conditions as increasing interest rates cause an acceleration in growth of credit card and other nonmortgage markets and continued very good performance from GCS and International.","As we look at our current expectations for the full year, we expect to continue the strong performance we have shown to-date, executing on what we had committed. For the full year, we expect NPI continues to be strong. Overall mortgage market revenue decline will be somewhat less than the 15% we expected, and therefore mortgage revenue in USIS and Workforce will be stronger than expected.","USIS and EWS nonmortgage revenue will continue to be strong. We expect market conditions to continue to be favorable, but not at the accelerated rate expected earlier in the year as interest rates have not increased as expected. International growth will continue ahead of schedule. GCS revenue growth being weaker-than-expected is now expected to be below our long term 5% to 8% range for the year. Taken together, performance looks to be better than our expectations when we started the year.","Now let me turn it back to Rick.","Rick Smith","Thanks, John. Let me just give you a little color first on the third quarter and then the full year, then the operator will open up for some questions for all participants. For the third quarter at current exchange rates, we expect revenue to be between $853 million and $861 million, reflecting a growth rate of 6% to 7% with limited FX impact for the quarter. Mortgage market headwinds impact third quarter revenue growth by approximately 300 basis points. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.50 and $1.54, which is up 4% to 7% for the third quarter also with minimal FX impact.","Mortgage market headwinds impact adjusted EPS growth by over 500 basis points in the quarter. Also John mentioned earlier, third quarter 2016 had a tax benefit that did not reoccur in third quarter 2017 and that will impact adjusted EPS growth by about 300 basis points. As you know, our long-term growth model of 7% to 10% revenue growth and 11% to 14% adjusted EPS growth, adjusting for the expect mortgage headwinds. Our outlook for both revenue and adjusted EPS for the third quarter is nicely within our long-term model.","The full year of 2017 guidance has improved as we've narrowed the range and increased the midpoint, shifting both revenue and adjusted EPS toward the upper end of our previous guidance. At current exchange rates, we expect revenue to end the year between $3.395 billion and $3.425 billion, reflecting constant currency revenue growth for the year of about 9%. We're increasing the bottom end of our range by $20 million in the guidance we had given earlier, which was $3.375 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to be above 37%, which is up nicely from our previous guidance.","We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $6.02 and $6.10, which is up about 10% and up from our earlier guidance of $5.96 to $6.10, and this reflects the high level of execution by the team and the strength of our diversified business model. And this is -- just to refresh your memories, on top of 23% adjusted EPS growth we delivered last year. Within framework of our long-term model and adjusted for mortgage market impact this year, our full year guidance for both revenue and adjusted EPS is also at the high end of our long-term model.","So with that, operator, if you could open up for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.","Patrick Halfmann","This is Patrick in for Toni. John, you referenced in your prepared remarks that total mortgage-related revenue was up something like 13% this quarter, while inquiry volumes were down in the high-single digits. I believe you reported a similar level of outperformance last quarter. So I'm just wondering as we think about the third quarter, three point headwind from mortgage and sort of the guide for the back half, whether or not that mortgage guidance might be overly conservative?","Rick Smith","Patrick, let me jump in first and then John -- well, this is Rick. The performance you saw, one, we don't think is over conservative, to answer your question. Two is the performances you saw in the second quarter of outperforming the market and market is defined in many different ways, has not been a 1 quarter or 2 quarter or 1 year or 2 year anomaly, it's been long-term trend. So we continue to expect ourselves to outperform whatever the market does. We've given guidance, assuming the mortgage market that I think is pretty consistent with many economists, we expect to outperform that.","John Gamble","The big gap you saw in Q2 and Q1 between our performance and market performance, a chunk of it is trended data, right. So we had a nice growth from trended data, which started, as we said, in the third quarter of last year. And so part of that very wide gap is because of trended data revenue. But as Rick said, we'll still outperform the mortgage market as we go forward.","Patrick Halfmann","Great. And then a quick follow-up, if I could. I believe in the past, you've talked about Canada as more of a mid-single-digit grower. Given the stronger performance in the first half of this year, I'm wondering if at least over the next couple of quarters, whether or not we should expect that to be more like high single-digit grower.","Rick Smith","You get a lot of noise quarter-to-quarter and geography-to-geography. And I don't pay much attention to that. We get great momentum in NPI, great momentum in Cambrian and across many verticals. So you may see quarter-to-quarter something outperforming and some quarter is underperforming, but long term, we still felt very good about being in that mid-single-digit growth as we spoke of high margins.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Greg Bardi","This is Greg calling on for Manav. I appreciate all the color on the mortgage segment. I was just wondering if you could give a little color on how you're thinking about some of the other consumer classes like auto and cars, just given the interest rate backdrop.","Rick Smith","I think from macro perspective, with interest rates not rising as maybe the economy had expected earlier in the year, it's not as -- you're not seeing the growth at the macro level maybe in the car business as you would have expected earlier in the year. But we have a wide range -- array of customers, and we've got some that are doing extremely well. You saw the performance in our marketing services, prescreening was really strong in marketing. Auto, even though you're seeing a plateauing of new car sales in the U.S. projecting it will be something over $17 million for the year. As, we participate on used car, Greg, as well as new car. Used car continues to grow. And we talked about our EWS business being lightly penetrated with a lot of room to grow. We signed a great contract with a partner in that arena in the last 6 months. That's continuing to fuel growth. So even though new car sales are plateauing, we continue to expect place like EWS and auto to be a good growth driver for us.","Greg Bardi","And then on the fraud and ID side, you sounded pretty excited about the InstaTouch and some of the other things you're doing there. A bunch of your peers have also talked about fraud and ID as being an important growth driver. So I'm just hoping if you could give some color on what you think can be the differentiator for you guys versus the peers?","Rick Smith","Well, one, it's important to know, Greg, that we thought about fraud and ID is not just in the U.S. where we have the traditional competitors. It's in countries where we don't have necessarily traditional competitors. You go to Latin America, we plan on bringing fraud and ID we have into those countries. You think about Australia, we're really excited about bringing products like InstaTouch to Australia. So it is a global excitement that you're hearing from us, not just in the U.S. And InstaTouch is very unique. And what makes InstaTouch unique is not just the technology itself and the first mover advantage. And that's one small piece of fraud, by the way. It is also that coupled with our unique data assets that makes InstaTouch really powerful. And by the way, Greg, we also alluded to InstaTouch being a really exciting capability we're bringing to Workforce Solutions. And as you know, Workforce Solutions has the unique capability that we have in our business.","Operator","And we will take our next question from George Mihalos from Cowen.","George Mihalos","Just wanted to ask, Rick, on the financial marketing again, which historically has kind of been -- if that's strong, it's sort of a harbinger of future growth coming your way. Do you still view that sort of relationship intact, that if you have the prescreen and everything else going up that, that will lead to a bit of an acceleration, if you will, in some near-term revenue?","Rick Smith","Good question, George. So the strength, first of all, was in three unique areas. It was the portfolio management, it was prescreen and it's out IXI business, all three exhibited really strong growth. The correlation and connection between prescreen and online, and we talked about this last few years. There seems to be a slight decoupling. It used to almost be a one quarter lag between prescreen growth and an uptick in online. We're not seeing that necessarily that correlation. We're keeping an eye on it going forward. And if it does correlate, obviously, that's nice upside for our online business and USIS. We've not seen that direct correlation for the past few years.","George Mihalos","Okay. I appreciate that. And then just I might have missed it, but just your confidence on consumer coming back in the fourth quarter. It just a matter of there was a push out again of some new products, and is that the driver or anything going on in the customer base that might worry you a little bit?","Rick Smith","The confidence level, George, is extremely high, and we've got great visibility into contract-level details. And again, if you look at the first half in compared to third quarter, we saw modest growth in the first half, slight decline to flattish in the third quarter. We got that visibility. It gives us high level of confidence that fourth quarter will exit nicely in the range, and that will bode well for 2018. Okay. Operator.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Brett Huff from Stephens.","Brett Huff","Two quick ones. One, you'll mentioned that you're going to try and get back to doing some buybacks later in the year or in 3Q. On a broader question of capital allocation, how are we still prioritizing things? I know you want to invest a lot organically. But as you look around, is there anything that you're particularly more focused on now inorganically?","Rick Smith","Yes. First of all, strategically, Brett, the priority remains the same. It's investing in organic growth, it's protecting the dividend we talked about and it's investing in share repurchase and inorganic growth. As you might guess, we have been focused the last whatever it's been, 18 months or 19 months or so, on the integration of Veda and de-leveraging. So as you think about capital allocation in the back half of this year and going into 2018, John mentioned share repurchase. We're back in that arena and expect us to get back in the arena of acquisitions as well. We do a good job of that and it's tied to our strategy. We've got a good pipeline and we have the financial capacity to do so.","Brett Huff","And then second question is when you think about prioritization of sort of the growth opportunities at some -- I know you have a lot of them, but do you think -- do you see a greater opportunity of simply taking the existing products you have in your most developed markets like the U.S. and spreading them around the world to different geos? Or is it do you feel there's more growth opportunity in sort of your NPI and just generating brand new products or maybe there's a balance?","Richard Smith","Yes, let me start at a high level and drill down. Number one, if I had to prioritize a single highest growth prospect we have over the next three to five years, it's obviously The Work Number. We alluded to that, that we have had a record number of adds of employers and records to the database. We talked back, I think it was October of last year, that we had a short-term goal of getting 300 million records on that database. We have blown through that number and are over 320 million and we're on our way to 350 million. And you couple that with the penetration of different verticals, you penetrate it's get smarter in that arena and taking that then global. So Work Number is by far the number one area that I see for growth over the next five years in the U.S. and globally. Number two, obviously, NPI is always a very strong part of our growth, and that hits across many verticals and many countries. Categorically, we've talked about fraud being a very, very important market for us.","We talked about InstaTouch just a second ago, and that hits all markets. Your comment on moving products around the country, we're getting better at that. That's a big part of what we are. It's cost efficient and it's effective to do. We'll continue to move things like our OSHA platform globally, Cambrian globally. Ignite will be another area in both direct and marketplace. It excites us as we port Cambrian worldwide. And oh yes, and debt services. Debt services. Interesting point in debt services, we tend to talk a lot, and there may be some questions today about Indesser. Debt Services in Indesser that the government in the UK has been a great growth driver for us. And interesting thing is over 50% of our revenue for debt services now comes from opportunities outside of Indesser and roughly 30% to 40% of it is outside of UK all together. We're deploying debt services now in virtually every country we operate around the world, and that's a great driver of growth this year, next year and beyond.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Tim McHugh from William Blair.","Tim McHugh","You probably explained this, but I may have missed it. I guess what part of consumer underperformed in the second quarter, relative to what you had expected? I think you had said. And then as you think about 2018, can you elaborate on, I guess -- I know you said you have line of sight to specific contracts, but I guess what parts of the business just more qualitatively are you expecting better performance in?","Richard Smith","Yes. The miss, Tim, was -- I don't know if I mentioned specifically or not but it was in our direct business. And we're trying to reposition the business as we talked about, before we have four-pronged approach that Dan Adams and his team have been operating on. NPI is a very important part of that, globalization is a very important part of that, working with our indirect partners, getting new indirect partners. So it's not a silver bullet. It's a continuation of repositioning of the business that he's been on now for six to nine months. John, you want to add something?","John Gamble","Actually, the biggest area was really consumer direct business and also some of the white label areas just didn't quite show the growth that we expected. And as Rick said, we didn't see the expanded growth through channels and geographies that we had expected we would see in the quarter, and that's just lower than we thought.","Rick Smith","And Tim, to reiterate, so we have great transparency. We can look at contract level, customer level, product level, channel level and we wouldn't see replacing. We've got confidence in returning to that long-term growth model in the fourth quarter unless we saw it, and we do see it.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And then just some model questions quick. On the debt, that was, I think, fairly expensive debt. So is that just a change in kind of the absolute debt level will run at going forward? Or I guess, will you replace that? Or how should we think about the balance sheet in that regard? I mean just the guidance -- sorry, go ahead.","John Gamble","We refinanced it with commercial paper. So the debt level didn't change but the mix of debt did.","Tim McHugh","Okay. And the guidance -- the small acquisition you did earlier or at least announced, I don't know if it's closed yet, is that incorporated into this at this point?","Rick Smith","It is, but it's extremely small. It is not closed yet, to be clear. The hope is that gets closed sometime here in the third quarter, but it will be de minimis in the third and fourth quarter. More importantly, it's strategically an opportunity for Dan to get in that world of the benefits world and sell and monetize products. So long term, we're very bullish on that, I mean in 2018, but 2017, yes, it's in our guidance but it's de minimis.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gunnar Hansen","This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary. I just want to touch base. I guess going back to Veda, you guys cited the onetime project making for a tough comp last year. I guess any sense as to how big that was? And I guess, just the underlying growth in Australia and Veda in particular? And any particular product or verticals that are seeing strong growth or maybe a little more insight there?","Rick Smith","Yes, it was -- by the way, the guidance we gave in the second quarter, obviously, we have full transparency in the onetime contract we had last year. So it was not a surprise on our end. Two, we remain very bullish on Australia and Asia as a whole. It can end the year with great growth. It will have a great third quarter and have a great fourth quarter. Well positioned for next year. Economic outlook remains very good for Australia. The consensus is 2.3 4 5 6 7% growth next year. Paulino, as I mentioned, is down there if he'll accelerate the adoption of some of our platforms and products and processes. So I remain very bullish on the entire region.","John Gamble","We also said that we're going to see for the last 9 months of 2017 growth in the high-single digits, so that includes the second quarter. And that high-single digit is at the high end of the range we indicated we'd see for Veda when we acquired them. So again, we feel very good.","Gunnar Hansen","Okay. And then, I guess, just you guys, I think, in December announced the enterprise-wide agreement with Silicon Valley firm. It -- has that driven a meaningful contribution to revenues? And has that established or driven any new partnerships that you guys have been working on?","Rick Smith","Gunnar, the latter is the more important. As we talked about, it's a nice revenue contributor. But more importantly, it gives us the kind of the cache, the credibility in the digital market space, and we're seeing the benefit of that.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey","Couple of questions for you. I guess, first of all, Rick, it's good to hear that Verifier is enjoying new vertical growth. Can you talk a little bit about how penetrated you think you are at some of those new verticals and how long the runway might be for sustainable growth in that subsegment of EWS?","Rick Smith","Yes. Andrew, it's amazing. I say this all the time. It is -- one, the visibility into the long-term growth is phenomenal. Meaning we see the levers that we can pull to continue to grow. If I look out 5 years, I see significant growth over the next 5 years for that business just in the U.S. alone and it could even be longer. And then you say growth, planting the seeds we're planting in Canada, Australia, U.K. gives you confidence in growth for years to come even after that. So vertical penetration, expansion, I think there's a whole new world of things we can do in that entire employer space and HR space that is yet to be tapped.","So I'm extremely bullish. It's been hell of a run for us since we bought that company 10 years ago. On the revenue side, on the profit side is converting the model from a BPO model to a data and analytics and insight model is remarkable. And it shows through, as you know, in the top line as well as the margin expansion. So I mean, it would not be farfetched to say that in a period of time, that may be our largest, most profitable business we have in the world.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. I mean, that's exciting. And obviously, there are lots of moving pieces still around ACA. But given what you know today or where you think we are in the potential legislative process, barring, say, a full repeal of ACA, it sounds like EWS is a business that could grow above your current long-term trends for some time. Is it reasonable to expect that as we get clarity, you might be upping those targets?","Rick Smith","Right now, we're assuming that there is continued headwind around ACA. And if that changes, if there's no repeal and no replacement, obviously, that bodes well for the analytics business within EWS.","John Gamble","But as an example, for the second half an employer we're expecting to see the whole employer business to grow nicely in the second half of the year, right. So kind of high single-digit range. So we've not only seen good growth in Verifier, we're seeing good growth in employer as well, and that's with a flat FWA business.","Andrew Jeffrey","Okay. So anything short of full repeal could be an incremental positive, maybe in the way you're thinking about that business right now?","Rick Smith","Yes. I think so that would be more for 2018 rather than 2017.","Andrew Jeffrey","Right. Okay. So hopefully, we'll have clarity by then.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","John, why aren't we seeing like an uptick in the minority interest as Indesser is doing better? Or shouldn't we start to see that increase more?","John Gamble","So minority interest generally scales with the performance of our International property because we have partners in many of our International properties around the world. So what you should see -- it doesn't tie perfectly because it -- obviously, the performance of different countries varies in any individual quarter. But in general, as you see, International growing more aggressively, you're going to see minority interest continue to go up as well. And we take that into account in our EBITDA calculation.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So you're saying that there's more than just Indesser in there?","John Gamble","Absolutely. We have partners in multiple Latin American countries, in Spain, in Russia. So we have partners in many places around the world. Generally speaking, they have relatively small percentages, but yes, we have partners in many of our businesses around the world.","Rick Smith","And Shlomo, that's not new. We've had those partnerships for a long time. In many cases, long as my tenure here; in some cases like Russia where it's occurring since we've been there, but that's not a new phenomena for us.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Right. I'm just wondering, is that what we should expect though over the next year or so that we should see this line item expand as Indesser does better?","John Gamble","Well, the line item will expand in general as International does better, right, because the partnerships are broader than just Indesser, right. And the impact of minority interest is really driven by improvements in Argentina, in Chile, in Spain and in other parts of the world where we have Peru or where we have partners.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then can you give us a little bit of order of magnitude between the variance in the mortgage services line item and kind of the MBA applications index that was down like almost 18.5%? How much of that was that -- the trended data and how much of it was the fact that you guys generally are working hard to outperform the market?","John Gamble","So we focus on different measures. So as we indicated, second quarter increase was down high-single digits and we'll probably try to variance off of that. Historically what you've seen is Equifax has outperformed the overall mortgage market by 5, 6, 7, 8 points, right. So that's kind of what the historical -- it looks like historically. It moves around quarter-to-quarter, but that's been historical move. Again, as we said, we've done much better than that for the past four quarters, and it's something that's because of trended data. Also you're seeing, as Rick mentioned, a continued improved penetration in Workforce Solutions, and that continues to drive outperformance relative to the mortgage market in general. And that, we believe, has legs for quite some time as well as new products continually being added by USIS.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jeff Mueller from Baird.","Jeff Meuler","Just on the global consumer side, I guess, as the DTC component and then slower than planned on the geographic and NPI. So in terms of the -- I hear you loud and clear on the confidence for Q4. When you talk about delays, is it a delay where you're slower to get into a market? Or is it a delay where once you're in market, there's a slower rate of market adoption? And then on the DTC side for Q4, are you assuming kind of a stabilization in the year-over-year trend? Or is there some assumption that it could continue to worsen and you can still get to the growth you're talking about?","Rick Smith","Yes, Jeff, it's largely a stabilization on DTC. And really, the slowness was not as geographic expansion in new geographies, but it might be taking products into new geographies and products into existing geographies. So to be honest, that was an execution mostly around NPI within GCS. But to your question, we do expect DTC to slow, stabilize in the fourth quarter. And again, the confidence level is very high that we'll be back in that range.","Jeff Meuler","And then the Verification Services growth was phenomenal in this mortgage environment. I think that you said that mortgage grew, and I understand the growth is broad-based, but can you just confirm that that's the case? And where are you in terms of mortgage penetration within Verification?","John Gamble","Well, we indicated that we gave our growth rate for mortgage for all of Equifax, and we think we said up 13%, right. So I can confirm that's correct. And in terms of penetration for mortgage in the GCS, in the Workforce Solutions business, I think we believe we still have a long way to go, right. Our penetration continues to grow, but as we continue to add more records, the hit rate continues to go up substantially, so our opportunities to generate revenue off mortgage from the Workforce Solutions business is substantial.","Rick Smith","That's key.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank.","Kevin McVeigh","I wonder if you could give us a sense, given the success you've had on the trended data side on mortgage, does it make it an easier transition to other parts of the business, and thus, even kind of quicker acceleration, if you would, across auto and consumer credits, so on and so forth? Or was it just the power that data speaks for itself?","Richard Smith","It's a lot of it, Kevin. It's every vertical. We're excited. And to be very clear, we're excited about the opportunity to trend data. We're trending data right now in different verticals in different parts of the world. But every case has got a stand on its own merits. The KS list and the value you get. In auto, in a particular country, it got to stand on its own. The fact you've got a success in mortgage market has no real bearing on the adoption in that new vertical in that new country, but we're excited short term and long term about trended data.","Kevin McVeigh","And then, Rick, could you just remind us the mix in new versus used in the auto side, I mean given the growth and things like that. Just is it pretty similar in terms of where the revenue sits new versus used?","Richard Smith","We don't break that out, but we play in both. That's what you need to know. So we are -- any time a car is financing, whether used we're there to play on verification of income, verification of employment and credit and credit score. So we're agnostic.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Andrew Steinerman from J. P. Morgan.","Andrew Steinerman","It's Andrew. I just wanted to clarify and check on the Employer Services within Workforce Solutions. I definitely appreciate the outlook. I'm just talking about the second quarter. Was the decline solely related to ACA analytics? Or is there anything else to discuss?","John Gamble","The decline was specific to ACA analytics, right. Other than -- if you exclude the Workforce Analytics business, we had growth of over 5% and the remainder of Employer.","Richard Smith","Thank you, Andrew. Okay with that, operator, we will terminate the call. I appreciate everybody's time and interest in Equifax, and have a good day.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect."]}}
