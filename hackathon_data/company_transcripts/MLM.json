[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and a copy of the slide presentation is available on the Investor Relations section of martinmarietta.com and txi.com. An audio archive of this call will be available shortly after the call has concluded.","At this time, I would like the turn the call over to Ward Nye, Martin Marietta's President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.","C. Howard Nye","Laurie, thank you very much. And good morning, everyone and thank you, all, for joining us on short notice for this announcement.","Our planned combination with Texas Industries creates an expanded platform for growth that will benefit shareholders of both companies. Joining me today are Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mel Brekhus, Texas Industries' President and Chief Executive Officer. In a few moments I'll provide the high-level details about the transaction and then Mel will share his perspective and discuss the significant benefits he sees for Texas Industries' shareholders in this combination. Anne and I will then talk in more detail about the strategic rationale and financial benefits. And we'll also spend a few minutes discussing our fourth quarter 2014 (sic) [ 2013 ] earnings results, which we also issued this morning.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in Martin Marietta and Texas Industries' most earnings releases and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","Moving on to the announcement. Slide 5 outlines at a high level the compelling strategic and financial benefits of this transaction and makes clear how the combination of our 2 companies creates an expanded platform for growth. Together, we'll create the leading U.S. aggregates producer, enhanced by a targeted cement presence. The combined company will have nationwide scale and enhanced geographic and product diversity. We'll be well positioned for long-term growth with uniquely positioned assets, including our best-in-class long-haul network providing us expanded reach into the largest and fastest-growing geographies in the United States, including Texas and California. Furthermore, by vertically integrating across aggregates and targeted cement operations, we'll be able to leverage the complementary high-quality assets of both companies and enhance our position as low-cost and highly efficient operators. The combined company will have a disciplined management team, a strong balance sheet, enhanced financial flexibility and better access to capital, which should fuel our long-term growth as we experience rapidly improving market conditions. All of these benefits, combined with the synergies we expect to achieve from the combination, provide a unique opportunity to create significant value for both sets of shareholders.","Turning to Slide 6, you'll see an overview of the terms of the transaction. Under the merger agreement, Martin Marietta will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Texas Industries common stock in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Based on the closing market prices for the shares of both companies on January 27, 2014, and their debt levels as of December 31, 2013, the combined company will have an enterprise value of approximately $8.5 billion. Texas Industries' shareholders will receive 0.7 Martin Marietta shares for each share of Texas Industries common stock they own at closing. Based on the closing stock price for Martin Marietta on January 27, 2014, this consideration would be equivalent to $71.95 of Martin Marietta stock for each Texas Industries share. The exchange ratio represents a 13% premium to the average exchange ratio implied by the closing prices of Martin Marietta's and Texas Industries' shares during the last 90 days and an over 15% premium to the exchange ratio implied by the respective closing stock prices on December 12, 2013, the day prior to market speculation of a potential transaction. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter of 2014, subject to shareholder votes by both Martin Marietta and Texas Industries shareholders, as well as customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.","An important element of this transaction involves voting agreements with 2 of Texas Industries' largest shareholders, representing approximately 51% of shares outstanding, who have agreed to vote all of their shares of Texas Industries common stock in favor of the transaction. We are pleased to have their strong support.","Upon closing, Martin Marietta shareholders are expected to own approximately 69%, and Texas Industries shareholders are expected to own approximately 31% of the combined company. We'll operate under the name Martin Marietta Materials and will be headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina and we'll maintain a significant presence in Dallas. I, along with the rest of the Martin Marietta executive management team, will lead the combined company. We'll retain top talent across the combined company based on a best-athlete approach. In addition, Mel Brekhus, Texas Industries' President and CEO, has agreed to work constructively with us to ensure an orderly transition and smooth integration.","As you'll see on Slide 7, we're bringing together 2 highly complementary companies, both in terms of geographies, products and areas of expertise. We're combining strong aggregates and heavy building materials franchises that, together, can achieve greater scale and efficiencies to deliver value.","As the #2 producer of aggregates for highway, infrastructure, commercial and residential construction in the United States, Martin Marietta supplies the crushed stones, sand and gravel used to build the roads, sidewalks and foundations on which Americans live. With our Aggregates business accounting for approximately 88% of Martin Marietta's annual net sales; and our Specialty Products business representing nearly 12%, we produce about 128 million tons of aggregates per year to 35 states across the country.","Texas Industries is the #1 cement producer by capacity in Texas and #3 in California. Importantly, Texas Industries' aggregates operations are strategically located in high-growth markets that fit well in our existing portfolio. It offers 7.4 million tons of cement capacity and over 100 ready-mix plants, which will further diversify Martin Marietta's product and customer mix.","Mel will discuss the significant investments in plant modernization and capacity expansion that Texas Industries has undertaken throughout the last decade. With these key strategic decisions, Texas Industries has achieved leading positions in some of the nation's highest growth markets while maintaining a low-cost profile.","As a result of this combination, we'll create a market-leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials that's poised to capitalize on the strength of our combined aggregates platform, as well as the significant upside potential in both the residential and nonresidential construction markets. We're excited about the potential of joining forces with Texas Industries and look forward to quickly realizing the benefits of this transaction.","With that said, I'd like now to turn the call over to Mel, to discuss why TXI decided to partner with Martin Marietta. Mel?","Melvin G. Brekhus","All right. Thank you, Ward. Before I get into my prepared remarks, I want to thank Ward and his team for all the hard work that they've done. But more importantly, the collaborative work that they've done that has helped us bring this potential merger together. And we will continue to operate collaboratively and enthusiastically to see this merger through.","But if you will please look at Slide 9. You will see the strategic evolution that we have taken at TXI to position the company as a leader in our markets. Since 2001, Texas Industries has expanded its operations and grown by, among other things, investing over $1 billion in cement plant modernization and capacity expansion ahead of increased demand and more stringent regulations. We have replaced 2.3 million tons of older, less efficient clinker capacity and increased clinker capacity by approximately 3.5 million tons. We've made these strategic investments in order to further enhance our reputation as a low-cost producer with state-of-the-art facilities and to get us to where we are today. We believe this combination with Martin Marietta represents another step forward for Texas Industries, as we seek to continuously improve our business and maximize value for our shareholders.","If you'd please turn to Slide 9. As one entity, Martin Marietta and Texas Industries will benefit from increased scale and scope, a more diversified portfolio of products and significant exposure to the attractive aggregates business. We've long admired Martin Marietta's success and strong execution track record and we believe the combination provides opportunities for significant value creation. As Slide 9 further outlines, this stock-for-stock transaction will provide our shareholders with a tax-free exchange and allow them to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined company, including the synergies that have been identified. Additionally, by being part of a larger organization, the combined company will have greater financial flexibility and a stronger balance sheet, allowing us to provide meaningful dividends to Texas Industries shareholders and deliver a solid platform for sustainable growth.","Texas Industries' board ran a thorough and robust process, evaluated available options and concluded that the combination with Martin Marietta fulfilled our goals. We are confident that this is the best outcome for our stakeholders, including our employees, our customers, our vendors and, of course, our shareholders. I am very proud of what we have done here at Texas Industries. As we look forward to this combination, I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions that have made this announcement possible.","As I opened my remarks, I once again say, I look forward to working together with Ward and the rest of Martin Marietta management team to support this combination and to ensure a successful integration. I believe the next chapter of our company will be a great one.","Thank you, Ward, and I'll turn it back to you.","C. Howard Nye","Mel, thank you very much and I really appreciate your kind comments and the way that your team has approached this. I think we really have done something together that's in the best interest of our collective shareholders, customers and employees. And I wholly agree with your sentiment and we're looking forward to joining forces.","Taking a look at Slide 12. I want to spend a few minutes now explaining in greater detail why this transaction is right from both a strategic and financial perspective, and the substantial benefits it offers to both companies' shareholders.","As you can see on Slide 12, this combination allows Martin Marietta to continue delivering on its strategic principles of positioning, growth and performance. We want to be positioned in the most attractive markets, leveraging multiple long-term drivers of growth and continue to differentiate our performance from all others in the industry. We believe the combination with Texas Industries lines up with each of these principles and represents a very attractive investment for our shareholders.","As you can see on Slide 13, Martin Marietta is geographically diverse with respect to its net sales. Texas, one of the fastest-growing markets in the country, already accounts for approximately 17% of Martin Marietta's net sales; while North Carolina and Georgia, which are in the early stages of economic recovery, account for about 19% of net sales. Importantly, Texas Industries supports our already strong position in Texas and provides a presence in the rapidly recovering California market. Combined with established positions in key geographies, this will lead to nearly $2.5 billion in combined sales.","Slide 14 shows the combined companies' pro forma position in the Aggregates business. Last year, Martin Marietta produced 128 million tons of sand, gravel and crushed stone, making us the second-largest producer of aggregates in the country and the third-largest shipper. Combining our aggregates operations with Texas Industries, which shipped approximately 15 million tons in fiscal year 2013, the combined company would have been the pro forma #1 producer of aggregates in the United States last year. In addition, Texas Industries' aggregates operations are strategically located in high-growth markets in Texas, which highly complement our existing portfolio.","As I said before, and as illustrated on the next slide, Slide 15, vertical integration will drive value creation in selective markets. The combined company will be focused on the key benefits available from operating in aggregates, as well as cement and ready-mix, and we're confident we'll deliver value from this enhanced vertical integration.","Turning to Slide 16. As Mel mentioned, one of the exciting benefits of this transaction comes with the work that Texas Industry has already done to improve its facilities and ensure their compliance with both federal and state environmental regulations. According to the Portland Cement Association, or PCA, under current environmental regulations, there are 18 cement facilities forecasted to be closed and 7 designated for permanent closure. Additionally, there are 3 more facilities that are at high risk for closure. Combined, these facilities represent 19.3 million tons of U.S. clinker production capacity expected to be removed from the U.S. market. Texas Industries' recently upgraded and expanded facilities could be the last commissioned for the foreseeable future in the California market. Whether or not all of those other facilities close remains to be seen. However, no matter the ultimate outcome, we expect that the combined company will be uniquely well positioned in California.","Growth is another of our strategic principles, and Slide 17 demonstrates the planned combination increases our exposure to some of the country's most attractive high-growth markets. In total, the combined company will be uniquely situated with top markets and states that account for approximately 70% of projected U.S. population growth between 2012 and 2017. Martin Marietta is strategically located in Texas, as well as other high-growth states across the Southeast and in other growing markets, while Texas Industries is strategically located in Texas and California.","Moving to Slide 18. You can see why we are so enthusiastic about our pro forma position in Texas. Texas is the #1 consumer of aggregates and cement in the United States, and the combined Texas operations you see illustrated in Slide 18 will represent 34% of pro forma sales in the combined company. The company will have an unmatched asset base in key markets in Texas, including Dallas\/Fort Worth and Austin. Our optimism is supported by analyst expectations that Texas will expand at an above-average pace in 2014 and beyond, supported by broad-based economic drivers, including housing and nonresidential construction, energy and related manufacturing.","As you see on Slide 19, the PCA reports that Texas demand for cement currently exceeds capacity, and that gap is only expected to grow over the next 4 years. Texas Industries maintains a leadership position in the state and we believe the combined company will be well positioned to serve this key market.","With this combination, Martin Marietta will once again gain access to California, which we believe is at the early stages of a significant recovery. Slide 20 details many of the reasons we believe in the potential of this market. The state is the eighth largest economy in the world and it is the #2 consumer of both aggregates and cement in the U.S. construction, behind only Texas. Between 2013 and 2017, PCA projects a compound annual growth rate in Southern California's cement consumption of 13.4%, and a 12.5% compound annual growth rate in Northern California over the same period.","Anne is now going to take us through the financial benefits of this planned combination. So with that, we'll turn it to Anne.","Anne H. Lloyd","Thank you, Ward. Ward has talked about positioning and growth, and we will now focus on how this planned combination also delivers against performance, one of our key strategic principles.","On Slide 21, I want to begin with a high-level overview of the significant financial benefits that this combination will provide shareholders. Importantly, we expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to Martin Marietta's earnings per share in 2014, assuming refinancing of Texas Industries' outstanding debt at\/or around closing of the merger and excluding one-time costs.","In the first full year of ownership, EPS accretion is expected to reach mid- to high-single digits. The combination will also provide meaningful additional growth opportunities that will drive revenue and EBITDA growth in excess of stand-alone projections. As I will outline on the next slide, taking into consideration the benefits from acquired net operating losses, as well as noncore real estate and synergies that we are confident we can bring to bear, we believe the run rate multiple of this proposed transaction will be inside 8x EBITDA within 24 months of closing. Finally, the combination will also help Martin Marietta increase our return on invested capital over the next several years, particularly as run rate synergies take hold.","As outlined on Slide 22, we expect to achieve $70 million of annual synergies by calendar year 2017. Through a nearly even split of SG&A savings and operational efficiencies, including incremental aggregates volume, incremental cement volume, ready-mix improvement and purchasing. This translates into $28 million in run rate synergies at calendar year-end 2014, representing 40% of total projected annual synergies. That number jumps to $57 million in run rate synergies or approximately 80% of total projected synergies through calendar year 2015. Our estimates exclude material real estate sales and any potential utilization of net operating losses, which I will highlight next.","From a balance sheet perspective, Slide 23 outlines our industry-leading leverage position. Both companies have undrawn credit facilities and there are no significant debt maturities until 2018. From a market perspective, we expect the combined company will maintain strong existing credit ratings and have pro forma leverage of less than 3x EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. Furthermore, we have an opportunity to immediately reduce the cost of debt on Texas Industries' existing $650 million in notes.","The combined company's financial strength and balance sheet structure, combined with further action to reduce the cost of capital, will help us retain significant financial flexibility for continued growth. We expect to rapidly delever the combined company, driven in part by utilization of TXI's NOL, totaling over $400 million on a pretax basis as of May 31, 2013. We expect full utilization of these NOLs over the next few years. In addition, we have identified nonoperating real estate assets that we may divest.","Finally, on Slide 24, we outline the ability of this leadership team to reduce cost and maintain a lean cost structure going forward. We believe this proven track record will be critical as we work to integrate our operations and achieve the expected synergies from this transaction. Further, we have supported value creation by maintaining a stable dividend program, even as the economy experienced the worst downturn in recent history. We look forward to providing the same dividend to Texas Industries shareholders and see that as another key benefit of the combination.","Before we conclude, I want to take a minute to discuss our earnings results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2013, which we also announced this morning. In the interest of time, we're going to keep our remarks about earnings concise. I refer you to our separately issued press release for additional detail, including commentary on trends and developments in our market.","We reported fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $0.77 per diluted share, an increase of 67% over the prior year quarter. Consistent with the trends experienced throughout 2013, our results reflect private-sector construction growth, pricing improvement in the aggregates product line and exceptional performance from the Specialty Products business. These drivers generated an 8% increase in consolidated net sales which, coupled with our disciplined cost management, led to an incremental consolidated gross margins for the quarter of 69%. Further, these factors contributed to a 380 basis point improvement in our consolidated gross margin.","The Aggregates business reported a 7% increase in net sales over the prior year quarter. Aggregates product line pricing, which increased 3.4% despite headwinds created by product mix, was a significant driver of this sales growth. Please refer to our press release for additional details on aggregate volume, pricing and margin.","Our Specialty Products business continued its strong performance and delivers quarterly records for both net sales and earnings from operations. Net sales of $58.1 million created -- increased 15% over the prior year quarter.","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Ward to discuss our 2014 outlook.","C. Howard Nye","Anne, thanks for that. Looking ahead to full year 2014, we continue to be encouraged by positive trends in our business end markets, especially the private-sector employment and construction. We anticipate growth across the nonresidential, residential and public sector and ChemRock and Rail end markets in 2014, as highlighted in our Q4 2013 earnings press release. Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 4% to 5% compared with 2013. We also expect aggregates product line pricing to increase 3% to 5% over 2013, although this increase will not be uniform across the company. Aggregates product line direct production cost per ton are expected to decrease slightly compared with 2013. Net sales for the Specialty Product segment should range from $225 million to $235 million, generating $85 million to $90 million of gross profit.","To conclude, we are encouraged by numerous macroeconomic indicators of increased construction activity for 2014. We believe the private sector will continue the strong growth noted in 2013, which should lead to increased public-sector activity. Additionally, we expect the trend of increased state-level funding of key projects to continue during the period of federal funding uncertainty. We're well positioned to serve these opportunities, to build on our momentum and enhance long-term value for our shareholders.","Before taking your questions, let's quickly discuss the map to completing this compelling transaction on 28. Moving forward, we'll file the appropriate materials with the SEC and work cooperatively to receive the requisite rules to file definitive materials and schedule the shareholder votes. As mentioned earlier, both Martin Marietta and Texas Industries will seek shareholder approval, and we've already received voting agreements from Texas Industries' 2 largest shareholders, constituting 51% of shares outstanding. Along the way, we'll work to obtain customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions necessary to complete the combination. Throughout the process, we'll also do our best to ensure a smooth transition for our stakeholders and it will be business as usual for all Martin Marietta and Texas Industries customers.","Moving to Slide 29. I want to conclude our call by reiterating how truly excited we are about this value-creating strategic combination, which we strongly believe is in the best interest of all Martin Marietta and Texas Industries stakeholders. The combined company will provide significant shareholder value, benefit our talented employees and lead to enhanced offerings for our customers. We look forward to becoming a market-leading supplier of aggregates, cement and heavy building materials with a nationwide scale and enhanced geographic and product diversity and to capitalizing on this unique opportunity to create value for both sets of shareholders.","Thank you, all, again for joining us today to discuss this announcement. We look forward to working with the Texas Industries team to complete the combination. I'll now turn it back over to Laurie to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Chris Olin of Cleveland Research.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","I wanted to just start with your demand guidance. And I understand kind of how you get to the overall number. But I was just wondering, if you look at this public demand driver, I guess you're guiding closer to low-single-digit range. Is there a way you could look at it by region? And I guess I'm getting at, is the outlook muted because of kind of your concerns in the Midwest?","C. Howard Nye","Chris, here's how I think about it. Let's go through end use. I would look at infrastructure and say that we're looking for slight growth in infrastructure next year. I think we're going to see, obviously, more of the TIFIA money coming through. I think that's going to be very helpful. If you look at the states in which Martin Marietta has a significant presence, I think we see good activity in Texas, we see great activity in Colorado, very steady activity in Iowa, and we see growing activity in the Eastern United States. In nonresidential, again, we see that up mid- to high-single-digit growth next year. We think that continues to be a pull behind what we've seen in energy and otherwise. But let's remember, we've seen double-digit growth in residential this year. We're seeing that across almost all of our geographies. The usual tale that we would see on nonres coming behind residential has served to be consistent. So if we're looking slight growth in infrastructure, mid- to high-single-digit growth in nonres, double-digit growth in res and low single-digit growth in our ChemRock and Rail segment, that's what leads us up to the 4% to 5% growth. Does that respond to your question, Chris?","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","Yes. Yes, that's fair. Also on the pricing, I was curious how much of the pricing outlook is affected by mix? Will it be a considerable headwind?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, I'm not sure there's going to be a huge mix issue relative to next year. I think a lot of it's going to be dependent on how much new construction you see on the infrastructure or on the commercial side. What I would tell you is the more construction we see on commercial, the better. Because that tends to be a higher-priced market area for us. But new construction will take more base and that can be your swing factor relative to mix.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Just last question, regarding the deal here. I'm just curious why the interest in cement assets now. I was always under the impression that, that was one of your businesses that you were less interested in. I was just curious if you had any thoughts behind that.","C. Howard Nye","We are interested in markets that we think are going to be attractive near term and long term. And I'll tell you, somebody commented to me one time that they thought Texas was going to be one of the great countries to do business in over the next 20 years and we think that's entirely right. And we think combining these businesses and having that type of leading position in a state and in a geography that we think is going to be extremely exciting is the right way forward. So what we're looking for in this, Chris, is just what you would imagine. We're looking to build value.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","Just as a quick follow-up. People that have owned Martin Marietta stock have been very interested in the Aggregates business. And clearly, as you highlighted in this presentation, this diversifies you. It makes you more vertically integrated. When you look forward, can you give us a better feel or a sense for how you think about the percentage of earnings coming from Aggregates itself versus downstream operations might be? And how -- well, let me start with that and then I'll follow up.","C. Howard Nye","That's fine, Arnie. What I'll tell you this is an aggregate-centric company. Let there be no mistake about that. What we've talked about is market positions where we're 1 or 2, and market positions where we feel like we need to be positioned for continuing growth. And if we're looking at a market like Texas, we felt like this was an important structure for us to have in that market. But if you come back and take a look at the pro forma business, it is still a very aggregate-centric business and I expect it will continue to be that and grow. Keep in mind, it's an aggregate-centric business with the Eastern U.S. and the Southeast business still down. So as we continue to see places like North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia go through recovery, what you're going to see from a percentage of earnings perspective will continue to be an aggregates-driven business.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","As a follow-up to that, your operating margins in the Southeast have been higher than your gross margins in the West. Obviously, with dramatically higher exposure to the west, how should we think about your outlook for margins in the next year or 2 on a consolidated basis?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, you will clearly see margin growth in this business as we see aggregate volume come back to the business. You can take a look at what we put up for the quarter. And part of what I'm concerned about is a spectacular fourth quarter is going to be lost somewhere in this news of a spectacular transaction, as well. When you look at the 69% that we put to the bottom line in the quarter that tells you what we're doing in a period of time that, frankly, we didn't get a lot of volume help. We've got some pricing help. But we did get some help from other parts of the country. Again, Southeast, North Carolina, in particular, that really helped drive that business, Arnie. So if we can put that type of incremental margin up in a flat-volume environment, you can imagine what's going to happen when the volume hits, and the volume's coming.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. Again, if I can just clarify. Think you mentioned that -- appears you're paying about a 20 multiple on current EBITDA. But I think in the prepared remarks, you indicated on an adjusted basis, looking out 18 to 24 months that drops to about 8? Is that correct?","Anne H. Lloyd","That's correct. Our run rate multiple is inside of 8x within 24 months of closing, assuming that we deliver on the synergies, utilize NOLs and then maximize the value of the real estate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Just first, a basic question on the structure of the deal. Why all equity and why no debt included as part of this transaction?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, it made good sense for us from a Martin Marietta perspective. It keeps our balance sheet in good shape. As you can see, we delevered through this in a very attractive way. I'll let Mel respond from his shareholders' perspective in a moment, but I think the tax-free nature of the deal makes a lot of sense. The other thing that it does, Kathryn, is it keeps this combined entity in a very attractive place to continue to look to grow strategically and do bolt-on acquisitions. Again, you know what our long-term strategic plan has been. And this is exactly what we're doing. What we're announcing today is consistent with what we've been talking about since 2010, when we pulled our strategic plan together. But, Mel, I'll let you take the other half of that, if you will.","Melvin G. Brekhus","Yes, Kathryn, I would echo what Ward said. And I want you to understand and others to understand that, from our perspective, with this stock-for-stock tax-free transaction, we get a very fair value for what we have built over time and especially the last 10 or 12 years. But more importantly, our shareholders get an opportunity to share in a value enhancement that will occur as we move forward. And that's really exciting to me and to our board and, I hope, to our shareholders.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","So with that in mind, you made some comment about keeping some dry powder essentially for bolt-on acquisitions. Does this take out the possibility of repurchasing your own stock at some point in time in the next 12 to 18 months?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, I won't speak necessarily to definitive time tables but I'll tell you what I said to you before, depending on where we are from a leverage perspective and otherwise. Look, we like Martin Marietta a lot. We know what we're getting when we buy that business as well. But if we have the opportunity to go and do some very sensible bolt-on acquisitions that will make sense for this business, not just 1 or 2 years but truly generationally, that's the type of value that we're going to be aiming for, Kathryn.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. Is this also a beginning of a focused West Coast expansion effort? Or is this more of a one-off? Maybe -- because you picked up the Colorado asset as part of the asset swap. You're now increasing exposure in Texas and gaining a foothold in California. Maybe discuss a little bit more about your Western expansion efforts?","C. Howard Nye","Really, our Western expansion efforts are consistent what we've done in the East, Kathryn, and that is we're looking for leading positions. And what we're doing with this transaction in Texas is truly putting a stake in the ground on a wholly leading position in a host of different markets, including where we sit in Dallas\/Fort Worth and giving us a nice entry to Austin, as well. I think you've actually been out and seen those Denver operations. We took down a formidable presence along the front range and what this does for us in California, honestly, it gives us optionality. That's the primary principle that I would outline to you. We have optionality in California on growing that business or doing other things with that business as well. And we're going to have our eyes wide open. The primary thing that we want to do, Kathryn, is build value for shareholders and we believe we can do that. I think we've done it very effectively in Colorado. I know we'll do it effectively in Texas and we're going to see exactly how we want to go ahead and move forward with a number of very attractive options in California.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","And with the California assets, would you be willing to JV the cement ops in order to pick up aggregate assets?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, I'm not going to lay out all the different cards that spell out what our strategic options are, but there are many. And we are -- we like to think we're creative people and I'm confident we will find a good solution one way or the other with California.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Okay. And finally, and I'll get back in the queue. Could you give a little bit more color on the asset sales, the properties? It may be too early to say what the potential incremental value is, but just helping us get a sense of the relative magnitude. Is this more like a $100 million-type transaction or a $300 million or $500 million-type transaction?","Anne H. Lloyd","Kathryn, it's not $300 million or $500 million. It's probably in the $100 million range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So, Ward, you gave us some volume and pricing guidance for the stand-alone Martin Marietta for '14, as you always do. Can you give us any metrics on kind of what you expect for the TXI business, as we look into calendar '14? And as you guys expect it to be pretty quickly accretive?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, obviously, I think you could take a look at those Texas markets and California and probably get a better feel for that. We're in a funny place right now because, I think, coming out and giving specifics on TXI business, is really not where I need to be as we're sitting here at this moment. But I think if you go back and take a look at what's happened this past year in DFW, what's anticipated with heavy highway work there, what's going on with population demographics in DFW and what appears to be a very strong return in California, I think directionally, all those markets look very, very attractive. And I did say in my prepared remarks that you're looking at a market that many are anticipating will be sold out from a cement perspective. So I'm not trying to be clever on it, Trey. I just -- from that perspective, I'm happy to talk specifically about Martin Marietta but talk about trends relative to TXI. And the trends for both are outstanding.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then also on -- can you give us -- and maybe this is for Anne, what NOL value you're assuming to get to the 8x EBITDA multiple within 24 months? And also if you could, give us some ideas of assumptions in terms of cash flow that you're getting in that math as well?","Anne H. Lloyd","Trey, once again, I think it's a little early to be giving guidance in that regard. But as I indicated in our opening remarks, we think the NOL value is over $400 million. That would be recognized over the next few years. And obviously, we gave you some indications that we believe that was in -- inside 24 months that we're trading at 8x -- or that the deal would be valued at about an 8x multiple. So that should give you some insight.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Ward, as you take the reins here, how do you expect to approach additional cement capacity increases in TXI's existing footprint? Specifically, as we look at the Midlothian asset there, that plant and the potential for expansion there?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, again, that's going into some specific asset that Mel and his team still have responsibility for. The one thing I'll tell you, as you think about that market and I alluded to it in my comments, don't forget our long-haul network, Trey, and how important that can be when you tie it back into those cement assets. Again, we're the #1 mover of stone on both BN and UP. And having that type of rail access and a more robust distribution network in Texas, we think really makes that combination awfully exciting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Congratulations. First question is, Ward, could you let us know on how much of your aggregate assets in Texas now can be consumed internally with the new cement and ready-mix plants you're picking up?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, Garik, that's something in the fullness of time I'm happy to give you much more detail on. But obviously, if you take a look at where our aggregates position is going to be in the DFW market or otherwise, it's going to be very attractive and you'll like the numbers.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, I guess this is a follow-up on the Texas market. Do you anticipate any sort of HSR risk? Any sort of meaningful asset divestments as a result of combining aggregate or ready-mix forces?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, we obviously look at that issue very, very carefully. We understand the market well. We understand the HSR process well. If we thought there was a serious issue there, we wouldn't be doing what we're doing here this morning.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, is it fair to assume that there may be some assets, though, that would have to be divested?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, as we look at it, we just don't see any material HSR issues and we feel very confident, Garik.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, and I guess just my last question is, just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the comments around year 1 accretion for 2014 and also in year 1. Is this primarily coming from the anticipated debt refi and the interest expense savings associated with -- I know that you're going to have some cost synergies as well. Is that mainly where the accretion is going to be coming from? Or are you anticipating revenue synergies off the bat coming through as well?","Anne H. Lloyd","So you have, as we indicated, we had a run rate synergies about $28 million through the end of 2014. We do expect the refi will drive a substantial portion of the savings on top of the synergies. And that is -- also, it excludes the one-time cost as you would imagine.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Right. Okay. So it's really coming from refi. If I had a rate quarter, it would be fair to assume refi first and then cost synergies second?","Anne H. Lloyd","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was curious, Ward, when you look at -- I think you listed 8 reasons for the deal in your press release. When you think about those reasons, I was wondering if you could kind of rank the most important to least important or maybe just the top 2 most important reasons for the transaction. Because when I think about it, it doesn't seem to me that, just alone being the largest aggregate producer really gives you any real benefits being close second or close third. And when I think about the synergy opportunities, those to me don't seem huge, when I think about the combined company being able to generate in excess of probably $1 billion in EBITDA by the targeted timeframe.","C. Howard Nye","You know what, Garik, I guess my...","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's Adam Rudiger.","C. Howard Nye","Adam, I'm sorry. Adam, my comment would be that the aim isn't about being the biggest. The aim is about being the absolute best. And what I believe is having these market positions in Texas and California and then using the optionality that we have in California to drive our business, if we need to, in other directions, we think it's really very powerful. I'm not sure that I would rank any of those in any particular order. Again, we have a lot of conviction around the synergies. When you put a multiple to those synergies, it's pretty powerful. And part of what I think we'll be doing, too, is seeing what else we can do with this business once we get it. I think the distribution network is going to be incredibly important to the Aggregates business, as well as to the cement business. And from where we sit, we think there's incredible value that's being built here. And again, my aim is to build the finest aggregates company in the world. If it happens to be one of the biggest, that's great, too. But we're about shareholders.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, so it really sounds to me like it's the geographic exposure that really is attractive for you.","C. Howard Nye","That's -- I would certainly agree with that.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then second, just real quick question on the NOLs. Is there any -- are there any issues with the change of ownership in terms of the ability to monetize those?","Anne H. Lloyd","We've taken a look at that, as you would imagine, Adam, and believe that we'll be able to realize the value over the next few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ward, can you please talk about your integration plan in a bit more detail? Once you do get the regulatory approval, especially on the aggregate side, just talk about the perspective of bringing aggregates folks to run the business of with -- at least on the aggregates footprint side.","C. Howard Nye","Obviously, we've got a very seasoned team in Texas, as does Mel. And what we're going to do is go through exactly what you would anticipate. We're going to have a best-athlete approach. We're going to make sure that we have the finest talent that's deployed in that business. We're going to take what we feel like is going to be a market-leadership position in the state of Texas and look to drive value from it. And the nice thing is when you [indiscernible] you'll see from both sides of this, we have a problem of riches from that perspective, and that's a nice place to be.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And any structural reason on why the price per ton on the Aggregates business on the TXI footprint would be meaningfully different from yours longer term?","C. Howard Nye","It's hard to see why it would be meaningfully different. We're picking up nearly 800 million tons of aggregates in Texas and Oklahoma in this transaction. So when you look at what it does to our reserve base, it's putting us nicely over 13 billion tons. And 13 billion tons of permitted reserves in the United States feels awfully good where I'm sitting.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Mel, can you give us an update on the pricing landscape in Texas and California cement markets? And just remind us how long are you contractually bound to existing cement prices? And what rate of cement price increases you're anticipating over the next couple of months?","Melvin G. Brekhus","Yes, we -- things haven't really changed since our last teleconference regarding that, Jerry. We have price increases that are occurring in Texas as we speak and more that will occur in April. We have price increases in California that are going into effect also in this first quarter of the calendar year. But more importantly, price increases that will occur in the April, May range. The business that we have under contract, as I explained in the last teleconference, is primarily the business that we have as a result of the tremendous amount of public works in -- ongoing in Texas. And I also would add that, that business, while it is under contract, the vast majority of that work does have escalators in it. And the other portion of the business that is under contract, if you will, is not longer than 12 months. And we also have the option to not ship that product if we choose not to. But we are choosing to ship it. But it's not going into our core market. So we aren't handcuffed by pricing. So long answer, Jerry, and sorry for it being so long, but pricing trends in Texas and California are positive.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Mel, the magnitude of price increases that you're expecting in the market in March and April?","Melvin G. Brekhus","It's about $8 in Texas. I think I'm pretty sure I'm right on this. About $8 in Texas and $5 in California.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, Mel, obviously you've added a lot of capacity, a really good point on the CapEx curve over the past couple of years. Any incremental opportunities to augment capacity? Or have you delivered on everything that's reasonable to execute?","Melvin G. Brekhus","Well, we've delivered on the major capacity additions and that -- the combined Martin Marietta and TXI assets will certainly benefit from that. There's always the potential for incremental tons in the cement business. We have, as someone pointed out earlier, really only one significant opportunity and that's to make some modifications at the Midlothian plant, to add some capacity. But as Ward and I have discussed, that capital would be spent if we can get the return on it, if the market calls for it. And only under those conditions would we be spending that capital. And it's not significant compared to the $400 million plus capital we spend when we build a greenfield cement plant. So most of the spending is behind us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace of Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So one of the things that we spent a lot of time talking about, Ward, and also Steve Zelnak, who I'm assuming is on the line, is kind of returns. And the focus of the company historically has had on shareholder returns measured more by EVA and kind of returns on invested capital, not kind of stock performance. And one of the arguments we've talked about in the context of downstream assets is greater cyclicality, greater capital intensity and greater volatility and, ultimately, lower returns. And I recognize that there's growth aspects to being in Texas and that TXI is a very unique asset. But just the first thing I wanted to ask you, in the vein of all those prior conversations, just what's really changed? I mean, again, we've always known Texas is the best state to have exposure to. But I guess when we run the numbers, this -- your invested capital is going to be $2.6 billion before kind of one-time costs that I'm guessing are going to approach $150 million, $200 million. And I'm guessing even at full benefit of pretax synergies and full benefit to the restructuring TXI's undergoing, that the return on invested capital's something approaching 6% or 6.5%. So can you just start by addressing how you think this affects your return profile as a corporation?","Anne H. Lloyd","Ted, as we indicated in the opening comments, we believe that our actual return on invested capital will actually grow at a faster trajectory as a result of the combination. The ability to deliver against the synergies, the ability to realize the net operating losses, the ability to generate value from excess real estate, all of those factors just compose -- be part of that return consideration. And also, as Mel just indicated, TXI has made significant investment in capital that, really, it's time to get out and let's let the market harvest that return.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","The deal will close in Q2, you expect. How soon thereafter might you try to do the debt refi?","Anne H. Lloyd","Our plan would be to do a debt refinancing at\/or near the closing of the merger.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And Anne, little bit of a detail question here, but do you have any thoughts or guidance you can offer about where the tax rate might shake out? When -- with the combined entity? I mean, I know that's a tough question. But I mean, directionally, I would think it would be meaningfully lower than what you guys are reporting. Is that, at least, a fair way to look at it?","Anne H. Lloyd","That's probably a fair way to look at it. But in all candor, Jack, that's probably not appropriate for us to speculate on that right now. We'll continue to look at that and refine it as we move closer to a closing.","Operator","The next question comes on the line of Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Congrats. I know this is lot of work. Can you just talk about the aggregates market in North Texas and what your pro forma market share there looks like?","C. Howard Nye","We'll certainly talk about the aggregates market in North Texas, and what we'll say is there's obviously a great deal of infrastructure work there. And as I indicated before, the population dynamics in North Texas continue to be some the most attractive in the United States. There's a Wall Street Journal article, I guess, last week, outlining the top 10 housing growth markets in the United States. I want to say that Houston was #1 on that list. I think DFW was #3 on that list. As you recall, Todd, DFW really lagged the rest of Texas in the recovery because you had simply more energy activity in South Texas, Houston and parts of San Antonio than you did at DFW. So from where we're sitting looking at DFW right now, we love the infrastructure work, we like what's going on in res, we like what's going on in nonres, and we think that's going to be incredibly attractive going forward. And coming back and looking at the market, it's a dynamic market. And we'll just leave it at that.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Keith Hughes of SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just one on the NOLs. Want to make sure I understand. You're expecting $400 million of NOLs within the next 24 months, getting the transaction price down, is that correct?","Anne H. Lloyd","After this, we think we'll be able to utilize over $400 million in NOLs on a pretax basis over the next few years.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as one questioner had before, usually there's some limitations on that in terms of how quickly you can realize those in mergers. Is there something unusual about these or something unusual about your position? And then second question is, part of the realizing those -- the assets that was said earlier which creates gains and then you can offset those?","Anne H. Lloyd","No, we've done an evaluation of the potential limitations as built into our understanding of the realization pattern that we believe we'll have on those net operating losses. And obviously, any time you generate taxable gains, you can also typically offset those with operating losses if you follow all the rules and regulations.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to return the call to Ward Nye for any additional or closing remarks.","C. Howard Nye","Laurie, thank you very much for turning it back to us. Couple of observations. One, we feel like this is an incredibly exciting time for Martin Marietta Materials and for Texas Industries. We think this combination is going to build considerable shareholder value in the near and long term . And I would ask you, please, to don't forget about what I think are some pretty special earnings for the Q4 this year. And I want to make sure that I give some real thanks to our team who helped make that possible.","Thank you, all, very much for your time today. We look forward to speaking with a lot of you very soon, I'm sure. And we'll talk to you again when we're done with Q1 and this year. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's call and webcast. You may now disconnect."],"13838":["Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. You may begin.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on slide two, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws, in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially.","Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Also as a remainder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information, on our website, and in our SEC filings.","As set forth in this morning's release, Martin Marietta delivered exceptional, record-breaking performance. These results validate the earnings power of our business model and demonstrate how our efforts are translating into enhanced shareholder value.","In the third quarter of 2016, we expanded margins and set new records for quarterly net sales and profitability. Despite some notable headwinds that I will address later, we achieved record-setting performance due to several attributes that differentiate Martin Marietta: our commitment to safety; our strategically positioned assets placed amidst, geographically, in some of the nation's fastest-growing regions; our ability to achieve continued and consistent pricing gains for our valuable products; and our relentless focus on cost containment. All of this led to record net sales of $1.038 billion, and a gross margin of 28%, a 210 basis point improvement over what had been a record-setting prior-year third quarter.","Notably, our profitability growth was achieved in all business lines, demonstrating steady economic recovery across our geographic footprint and product categories. Overall, we earned a record $2.49 per diluted share for the quarter. The profitability growth translated into an increase in operating cash flow of nearly $95 million and a $75 million increase in earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization \u2013 or EBITDA \u2013 for the quarter. In fact, the year-to-date September 30, 2016, EBITDA of $742 million is within $9 million of the EBITDA generated for the entirety of 2015.","Of moment, we believe we're in a more durable construction-centric recovery across most of our markets. We're confident in our ability to both grow top-line revenues, further increased profitability and cash flow, and importantly, continue to enhance long-term shareholder value. Widespread pricing gains contributed significantly to our results. Aggregates product line pricing increased approximately 9% over the prior-year quarter. Nearly all markets in Texas achieved double-digit pricing growth, which helped lead to the West Group's 14% increase in aggregate average selling price. Consistent with our expectations, aggregates pricing in our Colorado market, up 9% over the prior-year quarter, is now beginning to trend with or ahead of the corporate average.","The Southeast Group and Mid-America Group reported increases of 7% and 5% respectively. The ready mixed concrete business, with operations primarily in Texas and Colorado, delivered a 6% average selling price increase on a per-cubic-yard basis.","Aggregates product line pricing strength more than offset the quarter's volume headwinds. Consistent with our commentary at the 2016 half-year mark, we've seen the fourfold continuing effect of delays in Department of Transportation projects, particularly in Texas; declines in railroad ballast shipments; abnormally wet weather in many markets; and lastly, slower energy-related demand for construction materials.","For comparative purposes, it's important to remember the third quarter of 2015 benefited from volume tailwinds following months of historic rainfall in many key Martin Marietta markets. By contrast, during this year's third quarter, particularly in August and September, important markets such as Texas, the Carolinas and Iowa experienced precipitation rivaling or exceeding the rainfall seen in the second quarter of 2015, as best illustrated on the maps on slide five. These weather events, together with the second quarter's significant rainfall, inevitably led to severe flooding in some areas, making heavyside construction activities oftentimes impossible.","This circumstance was exacerbated on the eastern seaboard of the United States in October, as Hurricane Matthew left behind approximately 13 trillion gallons of water, nearly 1 billion gallons of which partially filled our Benson, North Carolina quarry. Matthew was the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in the Bahamas, with the storm's eyewall literally passing pass through our Freeport operation. While some of our East Coast facilities experienced flooding, sporadic power outages, and minor equipment damage, we were able to slowly and systematically resume sales at the vast majority of our effected locations, a testament to the resiliency of our operational teams.","As is typical of natural disasters, emergency repairs to homes, businesses, and transportation networks are vital in the early days and weeks post-disaster. Permanent repairs to roads and other structures typically take months or years. In this regard, the United States government has approved the early release of federal highway funds for emergency road repairs in North Carolina.","The personal impact of these storms on our employees and communities is not lost on us. In our home state of North Carolina alone, there are many who continued to experience the devastating effects of flooding. In fact, 34 counties have received disaster declarations for public assistance, and more than 17 Eastern North Carolina Counties have disaster declarations for individual assistance. Many families will likely remained in emergency shelters through the upcoming holiday season. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by Hurricane Matthew, from the Caribbean through to the Southeastern United States. We stand ready to provide help in terms of materials, and support those who need it so that our neighbors can get the relief that they need to start anew.","Our management has proven to be quite adept in dealing with unforeseen events, and we move quickly to remedy situations as best as we can. Yes, there will be short-term dislocations and sometimes there will be delays in moving our products to customers, but we see that situation for what it is: temporary. Our business is built on long-term growth potential, and today, we are encouraged by the trends indicating strong underlying demand for our products and future growth of our business.","This optimism is anchored in positive macroeconomic facts, including that employment growth nationally, a catalyst for construction activity, added 8 million jobs during the past three years. We expect infrastructure growth to be bolstered as funding from the $305 billion FAST Act begins to meaningfully impact construction projects in 2017 and beyond. Additionally many states, notably Texas and Georgia, continue to approve alternative funding sources to finance much-needed infrastructure projects to support growing populations.","In addition to improvements in infrastructure spending, we see broad positive trends in non-residential growth, despite some markets experiencing a slowdown in energy-related demand, and the omnipresent varying interpretations of construction start data. For example, both Texas and Georgia are still attracting large corporate headquarter relocations, which is fueling construction activity. In fact, Dallas leads the nation in non-residential construction growth, with Atlanta not far behind, ranked number four. Similarly, we're particularly pleased to observe positive trends across our markets in North Carolina and South Carolina, with increased investment, notably in office, retail, manufacturing and industrial development. We believe construction start data is being affected by the natural ebb and flow of megaprojects through the construction cycle.","The residential marketplace for Martin Marietta continues to slowly, steadily, and importantly, broadly recover. Dallas still leads the country in housing growth. It's notable, however, that we're seeing a changing, but nonetheless predictable, evolution in many cities throughout the United States. Specifically, there is an emerging trend in many of our markets toward an increase in more entry-level, single-family housing activity. This is a natural progression, as multi-family vacancy rates are low and corresponding rental rates are high. This circumstance leads to more families transitioning to traditional homes, and thus encouraging developers to open and pursue new subdivision work.","By its nature, single-family housing is considerably more aggregate intensive than is multi-family construction. We see this trend in important Martin Marietta cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Raleigh, and Austin, just to name a few. Furthermore, while all of the specific data points are anecdotally important, it's notable that we do not see evidence of saturation or excessive speculative building across our specific geographies. Rather, we believe our markets have room for continued growth and we're well-positioned to capitalize on this increased construction activity.","The ready mixed concrete product line is benefiting from both strong demand and steady pricing growth. This combination led to a 12% increase in Heritage net sales. Including the results from a July acquisition in Central Texas, net sales increased 26%, reflecting significant contributions from large ongoing energy-related projects in Texas.","Our pricing strength and relentless commitment to cost discipline, the latter being one of our core foundational pillars, is evident in our gross margin trajectory. The aggregates business gross margin expanded 120 basis points, led by the Southeast Group, which achieved a 530 basis point improvement. Our aggregates product line gross margin was 32%, an increase of 50 basis points. Our aggregates-related downstream operations reported a gross margin of 19%, an increase of 390 basis points.","For the third quarter, the cement business generated $60 million of net sales and $30 million of gross profit. Again, this is despite facing project delays and unusually wet weather in Texas. Excluding the results of the divested California cement business from the prior-year quarter, which provides a same-on-same comparison, operational improvements and better pricing led to a 570 basis point expansion in the business's gross margin to nearly 50%.","The 2015 impact of the now-divested California cement operations is detailed on slide seven. The business's third quarter results reflect $2 million of kiln maintenance costs. Fourth quarter expenses are forecasted to be $10 million.","The Magnesia Specialties business delivered another record quarter with net sales of $60 million, an increase of 5%. Lower natural gas and kiln outage costs led to a gross margin of 38%, an improvement of 400 basis points over the prior-year quarter.","Lastly, it's important to note that on a consolidated basis, we achieved an incremental gross margin of 91%, considerately above our internal target. We clearly have a host of trends that will positively affect our top line, as well, as a diversity of geographic regions and product categories that provide us stability in terms of our sales. Our aim is to always translate any growth into profits and cash. Our focus on controllable costs led to a reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales to 5.4%. Our consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $240 million, compared with $179 million in the prior-year quarter.","Our business is generating significant cash, with operating cash flow increasing 30% through the nine months ended September 30 compared with the prior-year period. Accordingly, we have both the means and the strategic plan in place to undertake value-enhancing acquisition activity, as well as fund capital investment in our business, each critical to our near-term, and long-term strategy.","That said, we're also appropriately focused on returning cash to shareholders. Based on our confidence in the outlook for our business and cash generation, Martin Marietta's Board of Directors recently approved a 5% increase in our cash dividend that was paid in September. Our annualized cash dividend rate is $1.68 per share.","Together with our ongoing share repurchase program, as of September 30, we've returned nearly $900 million to shareholders since the beginning of 2015. Over the same period, we've reduced our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from nearly 2.5 times to 1.9 times at September 30. At the quarter's end, our ratio was in line with our target. During the quarter, we also extended our trade receivables borrowing facility and increased the borrowing base to $300 million.","In today's earnings release, we updated our full-year 2016 guidance. The revisions reflect the project- and weather-related delays, most notably in the southwest and the impact of Hurricane Matthew. We thus lowered our aggregates product line volume guidance. Revisions to cement guidance specifically reflect a higher percentage of shipments to our own internal ready mix concrete business, reflective of our recent Central Texas acquisition and the previously discussed near-term headwinds, particularly pertaining to South Texas.","Overall, we expect strong pricing trends to continue for the full year, and record consolidated pre-tax profitability. We believe overall construction markets in our geographies have broadly stabilized, and anticipate steady volume growth in 2017. Pricing momentum is expected to remain robust, and we will benefit from leading positions in high-growth markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and the Carolinas.","As we look forward to the final two months of 2016 and beyond, our profitability outlook is the strongest in years. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity is underpinned by strong employment gains in our top markets and concurrence by third-party forecasters. Of our key states, Florida ranks second nationally in growth, while Texas ranks third, Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth.","Our longer-term outlook is consistent with those of Dodge NPCA, which forecasts growth in construction starts for the remainder of 2016 and the next several years. The Dodge Momentum Index, which measures the initial report of non-residential construction projects and tends to lead non-residential construction spending by one full year, increased over 5% in September to 129, signaling additional growth in what we view as a multi-year recovery. The notion of slowing growth in residential construction in the United States has been influenced by a decline in multifamily development, with the decrease largely concentrated in a few metro areas such as Miami, Houston, and New York.","Growth in the entry-level single-family portion of residential construction remains positive. Dodge currently forecasts single-family starts to increase 7% in 2016, followed by 9% growth in 2017, as compared to a multi-family decline of 5% and 2% respectively. Infrastructure activity should accelerate as the FAST Act and other state funding initiatives in key Martin Marietta markets drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads and bridges.","To conclude, we're very pleased with our record performance in the third quarter, and we look forward to completing a year of significant accomplishments. We foresee additional growth over the next several years, driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan. We remain committed to our core foundational pillars: world class safety, ethical conduct, operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction, and sustainability. By doing so, we will be true to our aim of increasing long-term shareholder value.","If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is open.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, Ward and Anne.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","How are you doing, Trey?","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hi, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Doing well. You know, the weather's been definitely a challenge for your guys this year, and Ward, you mentioned Hurricane Matthew obviously coming through some of your key markets. Can \u2013 and that you have tried to address that in your guidance. Could you, could you talk about kind of how we should be framing that up for the 4Q? What the impact that could have had on the fourth quarter, understanding that October is a very important month for the quarter? Just how that hurricane's impacting you in the guidance?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Sure, Trey. We'll try to wrap that up for you. As I said, we had about 1 billion gallons of water that founds its way into our Benson quarry. Remarkably, that quarry is still operating from some upper benches, and perhaps even more remarkably, we've removed about half of that water from that quarry since that quarry was hit with that. And all of that started hitting the Bahamas around October 6, worked its way up at East Coast.","Looking at precise volume impacts, I got to tell you, it's hard to sort that out, but here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. If we look over the last several years, in October, in the markets or the divisions that were affected by this storm, what we typically see per traditional work down here (21:06) volumes that could be going in those markets of about 200,000 tons.","So if we're starting the clock on October 6, when Matthew hit the Bahamas \u2013 and consider there are a lot of communities in Eastern North Carolina that are still very much dealing with storm and its aftereffects \u2013 the range of volumes could be in that 2 million ton-ish type of framework. And again, this represents about 30% of a typical October volume from those affected areas. So it's hard to put science to it, Trey, but again, we tried to look at that, sort out what we believe the effect will be, and we think that's not a bad way to think about it.","You raised a very good point, and that is, October's an important month. It's an important month for the aggregates industry, it's an important month for Martin Marietta, because typically you have what we're seeing here in North Carolina today. It's temperate, it's dry. And clearly Mathew did not permit us to start the month under that normal recipe, but that's how we handicap it right now, Trey. Did that help?","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely that was helpful. And then we've definitely been seeing volatility in non-res starts recently. Could you talk about how you look at this, how you look at the starts data, the choppiness we've been seeing there this year? And what that means for you, as we move into the next year in your geographic markets?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Sure, I'll try to. I mean, we look at the starts too, and what's odd, Trey, is the way that construction starts are \u2013 actually the score is kept on those. Because the stats, as you know, typically include a 100% of the total cost of a project in the month of the start. So what happens in the stats is it completely ignores that construction spending covers a period of months or years after the start. So here's what happens with those. If we look at the first half of 2015, my recollection is there were around 13 different projects across the United States valued at a $1 billion or more. So there was a $9 billion L&G project in Texas, there was an $8.5 billion petrochem plant in Louisiana, and I think there were two different office starts in New York, at in excess of $3.5 billion.","By contrast, if you roll forward, take a look at 2016, and you're looking even from the January to July period, as opposed to 13 in the previous year, there are only 4 valued at a $1 billion or more. But here's what happens. As 2016 progressed, you see a growing number of those large projects reach the start stage, and you see the delta in starts suddenly start to close. So as we're sitting here looking in 2016, total construction starts in 2016 are estimated to be up 1% to, let's call it $676 billion. But they're expected to grow an additional 5% in 2017.","So again, as we're looking at this year that I think has been impacted by a number of very different issues relative to weather, relative to the timing of starts, number one, we are not concerned about what we see this year; and number two, as we're looking at what the third-party forecasters are saying, relative to non-res next year; again, that's part of what gives us the confidence that I tried to portray in my opening comments.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. Last one from me. I know you guys aren't getting into a lot of detail here on 2017, but it does sound like you're looking for all of your end-markets to be up next year. Can you talk about maybe high level, how we should be thinking about things as far as relative strength geographically, and also markets that might be more challenging next year for you? And then kind of with that, the timing of the FAST Act and then the tough comps in 1Q, how the \u2013 how we should be thinking about kind of the cadence as we look into next year? Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Right, thank you, Trey. I'd tell you what I'll do. I'll go through what I usually do in this call, and try to give you an overview what we're seeing on a market-by-market basis. Before I jump into that, I do want to tag onto what you just said, and here's what I'd say in that regard. Q3 last year set a high bar for Q3 this year. And volume didn't equal what we did last year, profitability exceeded what we did last year.","Equally, people need to remember the construction industry across the U.S. is going to have a very difficult Q1 compare. We had remarkably warm and dry weather on a compared basis last year \u2013 or this year in Q1, which means the entire industry is going to have a tougher comp in Q1 next year. Remember what we've always said, too; in a lot of years, the last two weeks of March either make or break the first quarter. So I would caution people just to think about that from a rational perspective as we go into the year.","If I look at our business in summary fashion and go from west to east, and start in the Rocky Mountain division, I would tell you the economic outlook there continues to be very good. Private sector growth remains strong. We're putting a lot of energy to work in that marketplace. The DoT program in Colorado is very healthy. In fact, one of the biggest issues CDOT has is having enough bidders on different projects. The only real headwind in this division are ballast (26:38) volumes. And we've talked about that, and clearly they have been affected as the railroads have had more issues relative to energy throughout the year. Their profitability outlook, I think, is excellent; their ready mix business is performing at a very high level, as is their paving business. One thing that I think is important to say about that business is, I think they are in a relatively early innings as far as maturity. I don't think they're even in the seventh innings stretch yet in Colorado.","Midwest, and really we're talking in that context about Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, this has absolutely been our most consistent market. Their downs are not very low, and their ups are really very steady. Presently, Iowa, which is our largest market in the Midwest, is going absolutely on all cylinders. As we go into 2017, we think there'll be more DOT money flowing through. We think there is a continuing positive non-res outlook in that marketplace driven by data center activity that continues.","And the other thing that we're seeing, and this has been a story that you heard about several years ago but you're going to hear about it more, I think, for the next several years, it's a reinvigorated wind farm market. And those are very, very aggregates-intensive. The other piece of that market that strikes me as really quite good is, they have a very healthy residential market.","So the only headwind we have in the Midwest is you are seeing lower farm net incomes. I mean, to give you a sense of it, we're watching that move from several years ago at about $80,000 to more like $18,000, I mean that's a big fall. What I would tell you, too, is 15 years or 20 years ago, our market in that marketplace would have absolutely, positively followed ag, and that's not what it's doing here today. And again, I would say that marketplace is similar to Colorado, I think it's probably in a sixth- inning-type phase.","The Southwest in cement, you've really got a divide to a degree. You've got a North Texas economy that absolutely remains one of the best in the nation. Infrastructure is very strong; we talked about the fact that res is leading the nation, as is non-res. The bulk of the I-35 corridor remains very, very positive from Dallas to San Antonio \u2013 and San Antonio, and what you're seeing in pricing there, to us, is a predictable, but a very good story.","I think one of the issues that they are going to have in North Texas is finding enough people to do the work. And I'm not talking about us, I'm talking more about contractors, subcontractors, materials suppliers and others. I think as you look at that market in North Dallas, it's going to be tight next year. And frankly, our volumes, which were very high coming into this year, are even higher from a backlog perspective going into next year.","I think if you get a little bit farther south in Texas, clearly Houston is feeling the effect of an energy downturn. And we have seen some of that in our business. I think it's important to remember, as you think about Houston and Texas overall, 45% of our aggregates volume are in Dallas, 30% are in Central Texas and San Antonio and Austin, about 15% are in Houston. So do we feel some headwinds in Houston? We do. From our perspective, that's really not the big driver of our business. So again, we think that's likely to be a good, steady, stable marketplace. Remember, TxDOT is going to have a very healthy budget, we believe, for the next decade, and about 50% of our volumes in Texas find their way to some form of TxDOT.","Here's the important piece of it, Trey, and that is what we're seeing as we come across the Mississippi. Because the Mid-Atlantic, which really encompasses North Carolina, Virginia, and South Carolina, is much healthier. We're seeing volumes up in that marketplace. We think we're going to continue to see volumes up in that marketplace.","It's notable to see that in Boulder, Colorado, today, a handful of years after 500-year-event flooding, they still have $35 million that they're putting to flood repair in Boulder, Colorado today. That gives you some sense of the type of investment I think we're likely to see, not for a year or two, but maybe for the better part of a decade in parts of Eastern North Carolina. There were considerable parts of I-95 that were literally underwater, and that's clearly not a good thing for highways. From our perspective, we think there's going to have to be a lot of maintenance and repair there.","As we look at the Southeast in Georgia and Florida, those are two of the best economies in the United States today. Plenty of room to grow in the Atlanta market, and part of what we're seeing is we believe we're going to see much more work along I-4 next year. I-4 was suffering from about six months' worth of delays this year. So again, if we're looking at where parts of the country are as far as innings are concerned, I think that one's probably in the third or fourth inning.","And finally, in the Mid-East, which is really what we have in Indianapolis and Ohio and West Virginia, you know what? In Ohio and West Virginia it's having a tough time. I mean, I think that's a fair observation. Energy has made that market tough. At the same time, as we look at what's going on in Indianapolis today, it has been and it continues to be a very stable market. Good infrastructure work, better asphalt and better ready mix concrete work in that market than we've seen for a while. And we have seen a remarkable absorption on warehousing space in that marketplace as well. So as we look at that, it's probably deeper in the innings, I would give that probably a seventh inning from a deepness perspective.","But that gives you your march, literally from East to West \u2013 or West to East, I suppose \u2013 and a sense on where we are in each one of those. I'm sorry for how long that was, but I do think that's an important march.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Absolutely, and thank you for all the detail and insight. There, Ward. It's very helpful as always.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","All right, Trey, you take care.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","You too.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is open.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. A two-part Texas question. First, if you could give a little bit more color on your Central Texas acquisition. And then second, could you just maybe give more color on project delays that you discussed in the quarter, how much do you believe were driven more by weather, or sheer project size, so megaproject size, or is there something else we should take into consideration for those project delays in Texas? Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Sure, Kathryn. Let's talk a little about the acquisition that we made. We purchased the remaining portion of Ratliff Ready-Mix. Ratliff was a company that TXI historically had a joint venture relationship with, so this is something that's been on the radar for a while. We picked up about 1.1 million cubic yards, they've got 23 plants, and really it's in that golden triangle, Kathryn. It's on the I-35 and the I-45 corridor. So if you're looking at it, it's really in a couple of tranches. You're looking between DFW and Austin, and you're looking between DFW and College Station. So this actually fits an important niche for us in Texas.","As we come back to your question on delays, and again our primary delays are going to be in North Texas, as you may recall, in Q2, at half year, we had indicated that we came into 2016 with about a 3.5-million-ton backlog of TxDOT work and only 600,000 tons had shipped against that backlog. What I would tell you is, again, in Q3 there was very limited activity on those projects, but we did start to see some movement later in the quarter. I mean, here's one way to think of it, back to your question with more color. North Texas project delays, we've got 20 major projects there in the backlog, one dating back \u2013 get this, Kathryn \u2013 to the fall of 2012. Four finally started in September of 2016 and three began in October of 2016. Eight of the 20 have not yet begun shipping, and we have an infrastructure backlog now of about 5.4 million tons.","The other thing that's important for you to glean is TxDOT has hired several hundred additional people, and we think that's a moment, and we think that's a moment because I think there's a clear understanding within TxDOT that what they're faced with are administrative delays. We think that they are eager to remove those. So I think we will see nice movement on that in 2017. As I've said, what we've seen in 2016 in Texas has been an anomaly relative to that DOT. It hasn't necessarily been that much of an anomaly relative to other state DOTs, but it has been relative to Texas.","So, I've tried to help you on Ratliff, and give you the additional color in North Texas in particular. Is that responsive, Kathryn?","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yes, it does help. Just the one follow-up, and you, I believe you answered it in a previous Q&A, but we were thinking about Hurricane Matthew, how to frame it. Really wanted to get a better sense of similarities or differences of your experience in the Colorado; obviously there's a lot flooding in Matthew, but is there something that was unique about Colorado that \u2013 so Matthew impact wouldn't necessarily be as good as of a proxy?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? Not particularly. In fact, what I will tell you is, the flooding hit the Rockies then it had someplace to flow.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yeah.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","The difference is this: flooding was coming back in rivers, and it was \u2013 so you had rivers backing up in Eastern North Carolina. And you had rain in Western North Carolina fighting its way to the east. And it simply stayed there. And it stayed there for a very long time. As I said in my commentary, we're going to go into the holiday season and still have people living in shelters in Eastern North Carolina. So my sense is, Kathryn, that from an impact and dollar and cents perspective going forward, it's likely to be more impactful in Eastern North Carolina than it was in Colorado.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Helpful. Just for your cement business, and understanding it's primarily Texas business, but could you \u2013 there've been some, a few changes in the competitive marketplace in Texas. How has this impacted pricing in the near-term? How will it impact it in the mid-term? And any other color on your thoughts on overall capacity utilization as we look forward to 2017 and 2018?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I think that's what I would say is severalfold, Kathryn. As we look at that Texas market, you still have a market that's broadly sold out. So I mean, let's start with the notion that you still don't have enough domestic production to meet domestic needs. Clearly there has been some sort of transaction. South Texas at Argos we understand is not importing material into Houston any more. At the same time, what I will tell you, Kathryn, is we see two very different things, and back to your point, our Texas cement business isn't primarily in Texas, it's wholly in Texas. So that's all they have.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yeah.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","What we're seeing in Midlothian is a very healthy market. And what we're seeing there relative to volumes and what we're seeing relative to price, is it's a pretty good place. Volumes and price at Hunter have been more challenged, and at the same time what we have certainly spoken to our customers about is an $8 a ton price increase next year. And we have some confidence around that. So that's where we are looking in that marketplace for next year. And we feel good about where we are, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. And I'm going to get out of Texas, and maybe hit another region. Just would love to get a little bit more color on the primary drivers for your Mid-American group margin expansion?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","What's happening there is we're just getting some more volume, Kathryn. I mean, their cost structure is good, but they are simply getting more volume. Remember North Carolina lost about 40% of its volume from peak to trough. So what's happening is you've got a Charlotte market that's relatively healthy; you've got a Charleston, South Carolina market that's relatively healthy; you've got a Raleigh market that's getting healthier; and we're seeing more infrastructure work in the Triad than we've seen for years. So, when you are continuing to get good pricing in that marketplace \u2013 and in large part that's what we're seeing \u2013 and you're adding even incremental volume to it, it's very powerful.","That goes back to that notion, Kathryn, as the East begins to recover, it's disproportionately impactful to our business. The Southeast is important in that; candidly, portions of the Mid-Atlantic are even more important in that.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","And Kathryn, just you give some context, you saw that aggregates volume was down for the whole quarter for the company as a whole, we actually saw volume activity up in double digits in those areas of the Mid-Atlantic.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hello, Jim (sic) [Jerry] (40:02).","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ward, can you talk about the price increases, actions that you announced to the market or thinking about for aggregates for 2017? You in the past have spoken about the need to structurally reprice the markets in Colorado, Texas and Florida, and I'm wondering if you've announced significant price increases to kick off in 2017 on that path?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what, we'll give you much better guidance on that when we come out in February with full-year results and give you a real forecast for 2017 at that time. I think what you've heard us say in the past, though, is a completely fair way for you to think about it. And by that I mean, will you see consistent good pricing across the enterprise? Yes. Will you see the Western United States on a percentage basis outperform at East? Yeah, I think you will. And will we continue to see Colorado get better? I think, the answer to that is yes.","And part of what, candidly, I loved about this last quarter, that's exactly what you saw. I mean those are commentary \u2013 very constant views that we've been offering for a couple of years. And as you'll recall, we said probably two years ago, guys, it's coming in Colorado, just give it time. And here you finally saw it in this quarter. So what I would say is we'll give you more color on that in February, but if you just stick with that general theme, you're going to be fine.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And in terms of guidance for the year for the aggregates product line, just to make sure I understand your comment around cadence forward, so you mentioned the tough compare in the first quarter of 2017. I think the implied guidance for fourth quarter volumes is year-over-year growth, so it sounds like we've lapped a bunch of the weather headwinds, and I just want to confirm that that triangulation of the path is correct. So fourth quarter volumes up year-over-year, and then we'll see how the first quarter plays out, but the comps are tough?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Jerry, I think you got it.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And in terms of the downstream business, you had a really nice positive revision for to gross profit outlook for the year. A chunk of that I would imagine was acquisition, but can you talk about the organic improvement in unit margins, and what are the drivers?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know, what I would say is clearly some of that's going to be acquisition, but most of it's what we're doing with our internal business. And here is the way that's working, Jerry. I mean, our asphalt and paving business in Colorado is a very good business, and they continue to see nice year-over-year improvement in that marketplace. Our ready mix concrete business in Colorado is a good, solid, mature ready mix concrete business.","Here's what's happening. We said that you should expect our ready mix concrete business in Texas to continue to get better. And over time, you should see it performing the way that we're seeing our business in Colorado perform, and if you look at that business, that's what's happening. The cost structure's better, we're seeing much better pricing activity in that business, and here's the other piece that's helping there. You're seeing some headwinds in aggregate volume because you've got more brand new projects in parts of Texas, and you have to be working with wet soils.","But when you've got concrete, and some other gets to be on more industrial or more mature type projects, concrete can actually go. So here's the odd thing, we were seeing internal aggregates to our ready mixed business actually better in third quarter. We're seeing stone going down on road projects coming down in the third quarter, which tells me the underlying business is good, but what you're seeing in Q3 on the downstream businesses is just the better performance that we were expecting to see.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb from CJS Securities. Your line is open.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Congratulations on a record quarter.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Craig.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Just back TxDOT a little bit, because it does move a lot of your volume around. At this point, it sounds like they're gearing back up, but do you have enough visibility to say that Q2 volume really accelerates, or how should we look at that?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I guess what I would say is this. I mean, we're looking right now at a record backlog in Texas, and TxDOT has committed to at least $66 billion over the next 10 years. So keep in mind, Craig, even when Prop 1 was at its absolute peak, spending from 2010 to 2015, those fiscal years for Texas, was trending at about $5.2 billion. If we're looking at it right now, Prop 1 and Prop 7 should provide about $2.5 billion by 2018, rising to $3.1 billion by 2021. So if we're sitting here right now, we're looking at what we feel like is going to be probably a plus-$7 billion program in 2017, very healthy on the out years, going into the year with some of the largest backlogs that we've ever had.","So, again, as we're looking at TxDOT and looking at a marketplace that 50% of our volume finds its way into infrastructure, we feel very confident, both in the near term and the long term there. I've got to believe Texas DOT is going to find its way through these administrative delays, so that's one reason I wanted to give the metric that I did early in the dialogue about the fact that they've hired several hundred more employees.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yes, and Craig, if you take a look at those big projects, I mean, as Ward indicated, several of them started late in September, some more started in October, and based on our conversations with the Texas DOT, if you look into 2017, looks like a pretty uniform distribution of those projects happening throughout the various quarters of next year.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then on a broader note, the FAST Act spending across your markets, that's supposed to kick in Q2?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I'm sorry. Say that first part again, Craig, I didn't hear you.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","How do \u2013 when will the FAST Act spending kick in across all of your markets?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I think by the time we get to half-year next year, FAST Act ought to be pretty well flowing through all these markets. And again, I think you need to remember too, there are going to a number of these markets, for example you're going to see better spend in Georgia next year, you're going to see better spend in Iowa next year, you're going to see probably modestly better spend in Indiana next year, probably modestly better in North Carolina next year, still a record spend in Florida next year. So I think by the time we get to half-year next year, you're going to have a pretty good effect from both the federal and the state side in almost all relevant geographic markets.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And just a last quick question. Ballast, is it still down like 20% type decline?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. Ballast is still down. I mean, if we look at where ballast is, I mean clearly the Class 1 railroads, with what they are not moving relative to energy, is pretty considerably off. And what I would say is, the railroads have done what you would expect any major industrial company to do. And that is, they pulled back on maintenance and repair, and at the end of the day, you can only do that for so long.","And what I would say as well is we're not going to see a host of other people come in and put quarries on rail to meet that demand. We're going to be there, we're going to be ready for it, they are very good customers of ours, we want to supply their needs, and they are going to have some needs. But from a ballast perspective right now, it is one the more challenged areas of our business. I guess, the good news is, it's one of the smaller areas of our business.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot guys.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Armstrong from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Absolutely.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","The first one is, back on to Texas, could you break out your estimate of the tonnage impact of the weather, versus the delayed projects? And on Texas, you mentioned the \u2013 they have hired significant number of people, but do you think they've hired enough to catch up on the announced projects, or do you think they \u2013 that there's probably still more to go?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I think they've probably hired what they need to do to try to catch up. At the same time, I'm not completely inside baseball, so we're going to have to see what happens...","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, we also know \u2013 we also know that they have a budget request for even more hires. So it'll be interesting to see how that gets resolved.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","But...","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","But back to your question. If we're looking at really what we're looking at relative to headwinds in Texas, I mean, clearly, you've got energy sector headwinds that probably \u2013 this isn't just Texas, this is beyond that \u2013 probably 700,000 tons that are attributable to that. We mentioned earlier in the year that we were doing a transition from New Braunfels Quarry over to what will eventually be our Hunter Aggregates Facility, that's probably 600,000 tons. And if we're looking at just pure ballast sector as well, that's probably another 300,000.","And if we're looking at other headwinds and tailwinds, and this is principally answering your question, what does TxDOT Weather mean? It probably means, about a 1.2 million, relative to tonnage. So I think that probably gives you a pretty good bridge.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, that helps. And then just lastly, have you seen any rebound in the energy sector, as oil prices have started to come back, or is it you still think it's going to be lackluster for the time being?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","We have not seen a remarkable snapback yet, but what's remarkable to me is you do see more just early, early, early activity, once it starts peaking over $50. I can tell you the energy companies are really hoping it gets to about $65. I think if you see oil get to that $65 level, you're going to see pretty good activity there. So in the back of our mind, that's really a marker that we have. But if I told you we were seeing much right now, that wouldn't be correct.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Perfect. That helps. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, James.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on how you're thinking about incremental margins going into 2017. Clearly had strong performance here in the third quarter. How sustainable is this above 60% trend that you've been delivering on? And as you look at the different cost buckets moving forward, what are you seeing?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","So Garik, are you saying that the 90% worked pretty well?","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I guess what I would say, Garik, is what we've talked about was averages, right? And we said, when we saw our volume fall 80 million tons, we thought that for the first 40 million tons of recovery in our Heritage business, we would see it on average at 60% incremental margin. And clearly that's what we're seeing. We're seeing it plus that.","Here's what's happening. You are getting the incremental margin boost because you're seeing a shift to more in the East. And again, here I've got something that we've been very transparent on, and we've spoken about for years. Because we said, we couldn't even hit the 60% all by itself, if we were just counting on a Western recovery all by itself. So if you believe, as I do, that we are in early innings in the Southeast, and in relative early innings in the Mid-Atlantic, then I think we're going to be certainly above that target that we've said.","Now, do I think we're going to show up every quarter with 90%. I'd like to say that I thought we would, but I think that would be a little bit ambitious, so I'm not encouraging you to go and model that. But again, I think if you just come back, think about that average on 60%, and keep in mind, pricing's probably doing better than what we thought it was going to do as we went through this cycle, so maybe last a little bit longer than we thought it would when we said that first 40 million tons. So I would tell you, it has the capacity to endure. I think geographic mix is our friend. Clearly pricing has been our friend, and our cost profile is very attractive. So I think we remain pretty resilient around that.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Garik, just to give you some color on capacity, if you look at those, kind of the Southeastern markets, those are just barely ticking above 50% of prior period peaks, although pricing there is still incredibly strong. And then if you look at \u2013 through the Carolinas, those markets are probably between the 65% and 70% of prior peak, so they still have some of that operating leverage room to go. And again, pricing's, just like the quarter, pricing just falls directly through.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. So, if we think about potential buckets of inflation for next year, whether it's labor or energy cost, the message is that the leverage plus the pricing should more than offset to continue...?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah, Garik, that should be. I don't think there is anything up that's going to remarkable. And keep in mind, in fairness energy has been the industry's friend for the last several years. I think energy is going to continue, on a compared basis, to be the industry's friend. When we get to that point that energy is not the industry's friend, what you'll recall is historically, energy has been an impetus for pricing as well. So I don't see anything that I would think would be rocking your model from a material perspective on inputs next year.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","So the one thing I would say that potentially could be deflationary as we move into next year, is we have made some good investment in mobile equipment to help with the repair and maintenance costs on the business, and are beginning to see trends of that \u2013 of decline in the per-ton cost of repair and maintenance. So I think we would expect to see some future benefit into that, into 2017, Garik.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. A quick follow-up question, just wanted to clarify on volume. If we look at the 2016 volume guidance for aggregates, backing into a 4Q projection of about 3% to 7% volume growth, just want to be clear that this does incorporate the initial impact from Hurricane Matthew. There's been a lot of discussion about the event on the call today, recognizing it happened in October, which is the most important month of the quarter. So I just want to make sure...","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","...that my facts and figures are correct?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Your facts and figures are correct.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Good luck.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Garik.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is open.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, Ward, Anne, thank you guys for taking my question. A quick question on the pricing side, is there a way to kind of split out how much of that was mix, be it either regional or product mix, kind of when we're thinking about just the pricing environment overall?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I'll tell you, we look at that very carefully every quarter, and I'm delighted to tell you that whatever the number was, it was immaterial. So what you're seeing tends to be what it does now.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, good news. And this is kind of more of a hypothetical, but lots of discussion out there now about some form of fiscal stimulus. To the extent that whoever becomes President could get something passed, let's say in the first 100 days, what would be a realistic sort of timeframe to where projects would start moving forward, and we start to \u2013 you all would start to see volumes as a result of that?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","That's hard to say. I mean, I think you could go back over a usual highway bill and look at the rhythm and cadence on that, and say it takes probably 18 months for something really to start finding its way in a meaningful fashion. So I wouldn't expect it to be immediate, but I would expect it to be pretty impactful to our business, if that happens. I think one of the big issues that we need to keep in mind is, looking at employment across the United States and sorting out those states that even when you put the stimulus in, who's going to be able to put workers out there who can put that down? And the good news is, there are some Martin Marietta states where we think that can very much happen right now.","But here's part of what what's different, I think it's interesting, Stanley, and it's a clear recurring theme that we're hearing from contractors, and that is, they're busy. And they haven't gone and hired a bunch of new people to come to work for them, because they're busy. If they've got a heavy financial incentive to go and accelerate a project, they will. If they have a strong financial disincentive to get something done, they'll follow that as well. But I think there are a lot of contractors, who're just as busy as they want to be. They're making good money, they don't want to overextend their businesses, and if they have can good multi-year backlogs and just continue to work that in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, yeah, I think they're pretty pleased with that.","And if you're seeing what we did in this quarter with down volume, if we see just good, steady slow volume in this business, based on the enterprise that we've built, I think it's very powerful. And I think additional stimulus from whoever the next President is could be very powerful in this business. Do I think it's a 2017 event? No. Do I think it could be a mid-2018 event? Yeah, probably so.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, guys. Thank you very much, and the best of luck.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Stanley.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Hi, good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Good afternoon, Brent. How are you?","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","I'm doing well. Thanks. You made an \u2013 Ward, you made an interesting reference to single-family versus multi-family, and kind of differences in concrete intensity, I think, particularly coming down to subdivisions. And obviously seeing that dynamic shift on a national basis, but was kind of thinking about your larger MSAs, Dallas, Denver, Atlanta, so on, are you seeing that dynamic develop at an equivalent pace, or even more?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","No, we are. But here's the way I would think about it if I were you, Brent, the West has already seen that happen, to a degree much more than the East has. So in my prepared commentary I think I mentioned Austin as one of those. But what you heard was then also somebody said Atlanta, and I said Charlotte, and I said places like Raleigh. So now we're seeing the Eastern United States go through that same transition, frankly, that we saw the Western U.S. doing 18 or 24 months ago.","So directly to your point, if we're building a multifamily facility, really it's going to take stone on the base and concrete that's going to go on the pads. If we see new subdivision work, until those roads and streets are accepted by a local municipality for maintenance, everything that we're selling on the roads, everything that we're selling on the sidewalks, everything that we're selling on the utilities, everything that we're selling on the lot, counts as residential. So when we see that type of turn hitting a city like Charlotte right now, and Atlanta right now, and Charlotte right now \u2013 by the way, all still in very early stages of that \u2013 it is much more aggregate-intensive, and we think it's much more powerful.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Sure. No, it is interesting. On Georgia, I didn't catch from your comments that you had necessarily seen much of an effect from infrastructure work yet, most of the growth was coming from some of the other sectors. Is that accurate?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I believe the best is yet to come in that state. Remember a couple of things here. One, they had the tax initiative that they referred to as TSPLOST that really ended up hitting three different geographic areas in South Georgia several years ago, which has given that part of the state a good, steady infrastructure ride. What we believe is going to happen is, with the new $900 million that came through the House bill last year, we're going to see more overall Georgia DOT work, it's going to be more impactful in 2017 than it was in 2016 \u2013 and by the way, that's what we thought 2016 was going to be \u2013 and we think we're likely to see more of that in the early phases in North Georgia, read Atlanta, than in South Georgia. So I think your take is right, Brent.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then, it's obviously hard to detect any concern from you about Texas. You just did another deal in the market, it looks like, and I guess the question is, do you like the size of the business or platform you have there today? Do you want to be careful about the proportion of exposure you have to Texas, and kind of still look for some more fillers like the one you just did?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. I guess what I would say is, we're looking to grow our business in places that we have good, leading positions on, and we can do value-enhancing acquisitions. So the one that we just finished in Texas was really one that, given the JV status, we were going to do anyway. But keep in mind, Stanley, it fits entirely \u2013 I meant Brent \u2013 it fits entirely in that marketplace that means a lot to us, and that's the golden triangle.","So where we bought that business is exactly where our strategic plan dictates that we would buy it. The other thing that I would tell you is, if you're looking at Texas and how that stake's going to grow between now and 2050, you're going to have 70% of the population in Texas living in the golden triangle.","And remember, when you're looking at that, you're looking at a space that's roughly the size of Pennsylvania anyway. And we will have, and we do have, the leading position in that marketplace. That said, do we want to grow in the Eastern U.S.? You bet, we do. Are we looking at transactions potentially there? We certainly are. Do we think we did the right transaction in Central Texas and North Texas with Ratliff? We believe we did.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","And Brent, I do think, as we indicated earlier, the activity, the growth we're beginning to see in the early innings, where I think you characterized it as in the third or fourth inning, coming into the Carolinas, as we see the volumes come back there, I think the mix of the business actually will rationalize out a little bit more than the skew that it has been a little bit more to Texas, just simply because the Southeast and Carolinas have been down so long. So that's part of what I think will be the balancing and diversification of our model.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Does that help, Brent?","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Absolutely. Thanks so much, and best of luck here closing out the year.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks a lot. Catch you soon.","Brent Edward Thielman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you and our next question come from the line of Mike Betts from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Thank you very much. Yeah, just three quick questions, if I could, from me. First one just to help with the model building. Ratliff was a joint venture. Were you consolidating half of the 1.1 million cubic yards, or was it off not being consolidated at all beforehand? Secondly, Ward, I think when you talked about the reduction in guidance in the cement business, you talked about the higher proportion of internal sales. I would've thought you kind of transferred those across at market price, or am I misunderstanding your point you were making there? So maybe just a bit more explanation on that point.","And then, there were no share buybacks in the quarter. Maybe you're able to comment on why that might have been the case, given what the share prices did? Was it because you thought you may have to reduce the guidance, and therefore it wasn't appropriate to do it? You able to say anything on that? Thanks.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Mike, I'll try to say something on the all three of those, how about that? Here's what I would on the Ratliff piece, no we weren't consolidating anything.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","No. it was a nonconsolidated entity, and all of its tonnage would've been included in external tons, so then now they've included in internal tons.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Relative to transfer ...","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. Relative to transfer pricing, Mike, your question, we transfer at market. So I can answer that directly to you.","And relative to the share buybacks, what I can tell you is, we have this bad habit, we joke about it, we try to do exactly what we say we're going to do. And if you think back to what we said, we wanted to maintain that debt-to-EBITDA ratio of two times, but we've also said that our first priority are doing the right transactions. So if you look at where we ended the quarter, and if you look at the transaction that we did, and if you look at where it left our ratio, it was exactly where we said we wanted to be. So what I will tell you is, if people are listening to our words, there should be no surprise on that. So that was the driver of the lack of share buybacks in Q3.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay. And then lastly, are there any other major joint ventures that you have that could be in a similar situation to Ratliff?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","No. There are not any other major ones that I would anticipate having a similar conversation around.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Understood. That's great. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Ward Nye for closing remarks.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks again for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings call. We are excited about the future of Martin Marietta, and we're in a very advantageous position through our superior geographic locations in markets that continue to experience strong employment growth.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's first quarter earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on slide two, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially.","Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","In addition, and as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information, which is also available on our website and in our SEC filings.","As you read in this morning's first quarter 2017 earnings release, Martin Marietta performed very well with diluted earnings per share reaching $0.67. Our bottom line was driven by our ability to set records or near records on a number of key financial metrics, among them, net sales, consolidated gross profit, earnings from operations, net earnings and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization or EBITDA.","To remind you, the first quarter of 2017 is being compared against last year's unusually favorable first quarter operating conditions, and notably, significantly eclipsed all other historical first quarter results for the company prior to 2016.","This year's first quarter can be summarized as follows: We translated strong top line growth into solid profitability and cash flow generation. Our results are even more impressive when you take into account that during the period, we accelerated production and maintenance costs to better position Martin Marietta for anticipated robust market condition in many of our geographies.","As significant as we believe our headline numbers are, we think you'll be more interested into delving into where these results are coming from, and the quality more so than the quantity of the numbers. Further, we typically regard the last several weeks of the first quarter as a springboard for following quarters and, as we will address later, future years.","These strong results are no coincidence, but rather, the product of our team's thoughtful strategic planning process, placing us directionally and geographically in the right places with the right people and resources and at the right time. This vital coalescence of planning, disciplined operational execution and commercial performance provided our business with a remarkable financial outcome in what has always been ours and the industry's least profitable quarter of the year. Thus, Martin Marietta now safely, operationally and otherwise, enters the beginning of the 2017 construction season fully prepared to meet increasing customer demand as the durable economic recovery continues across our businesses.","Against that backdrop, it's not surprising that our disciplined execution resulted in the following for the first quarter: record net sales of $792 million, record consolidated gross profit of $147 million and near-record earnings per diluted share of $0.67. Additionally, our growth translated to near record first quarter EBITDA of $148 million and operating cash flow of $74 million. These first quarter results reinforced our outlook and expectations for a vibrant 2017 construction season.","Our full year 2017 guidance, which we reaffirmed in today's release and is summarized on slides seven and eight, reflects our confidence in Martin Marietta's ability to continue to capitalize on the country's macroeconomic momentum and deliver volume growth, strong pricing and expanding margins across the enterprise.","Broad pricing gains throughout our aggregates-led Building Materials business contributed to our record first quarter performance. Aggregates product line average selling price increased more than 5% over the comparable prior-year period, led by the Southeast Group's 10.3% increase, the Mid-America and West Groups reported increases of 4.4% and nearly 3%, respectively.","The ready mixed concrete business with operations primarily Texas and Colorado delivered a more than 3% increase in average selling price per cubic yard and our cement (05:34) increased 2.5%. We're particularly encouraged by the price gains in cement as these are ahead of our announced April price increases.","The pricing increases combined with the quarter's solid shipments enabled us to turn in such outstanding first quarter performance. Shipment growth was seen in our Southeast Group and Rocky Mountain division as each delivered double-digit aggregates product line volume growth with increases of 16% and 15%, respectively. We view this performance as particularly notable.","Remember, our Rocky Mountain division was one of the earliest regions of the United States to enter an economic expansion while conversely the Southeast is accelerating beyond recovery into expansion. We believe this underscores both the durable nature of the construction expansion in Colorado as well as its natural and expected broadening to Martin Marietta's important Southeastern markets.","In the Mid-America Group, the Mid-Atlantic division, which includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, reported a volume increase of 1.5% against a challenging year-over-year comparison. South Carolina drove performance in the quarter as that state continues to benefit from its own early phase of economic expansion. Further, South Carolina's strength alone nearly offset this year's more normal winter weather patterns experienced in the Mideast and Midwest divisions.","Additionally, we saw volume increases in the continued vibrant Dallas-Fort Worth marketplace as well as a pickup in shipments in Houston. Volumes predictably declined in South Texas as we experienced an interim period following 2016's completion of several significant energy-related projects. As a reminder, new large energy-related projects are planned for later this year and next.","We see further encouraging signs in Texas. The overall energy sector is in recovery, and importantly, the North Texas market remains consistently good. Accordingly, our March 2017 cement shipments were at the highest level since our acquisition of these strategic assets in mid-2014. Moreover, shipments represented the highest level for March in the Texas cement operations since 2003. The strength of cement volumes led our operational team generating the best March financial performance for that business during those same periods. When coupled with the Portland Cement Association's, or PCA, forecast, calling for multi-year growth in Texas cement shipments, we believe March's results serve to reinforce our confidence in PCA's positive 5-year outlook.","To complete the discussion of the Building Materials business, our ready mixed concrete and asphalt product lines reported volume gains for the quarter with particular strength in Colorado. Collectively, our Building Materials business generated $125 million of gross profit. The Southeast Group led gross margin performance with a 120 basis point expansion over the prior-year quarter, driven by the previously mentioned average selling price and volume growth together with solid cost control.","The Building Materials business' first quarter results reflect $4 million of kiln maintenance costs and the cement product line. We also accelerated certain operational preparations in our aggregates product line including grain, equipment maintenance and repair as well as increased production where possible to increase our readiness for the remainder of 2017.","In addition to our impressive Building Materials business' early results, the Magnesia Specialties business also delivered a record first quarter with net sales of $63 million, reflecting an increase of more than 6% compared with the first quarter of 2016 with growth in both the chemicals and lime products volumes. Gross margin was over 35% despite higher natural gas prices and increased contract service expenses.","To summarize our first quarter discussion, it's fair to say that we believe our financial and operating results are a harbinger of things to come as our multi-year outlook remains optimistic. The fundamental drivers of the broad-based construction recovery including sustained employment growth in key Martin Marietta metropolitan areas remains firmly in place and our operations are well prepared to meet increased product demand.","As we've often noted, job growth in our key markets is a critical metric since it serves as an important catalyst for overall construction activity. The United States added nearly 2.4 million jobs during the trailing 12 months and positive employment data from Martin Marietta's top states further solidifies our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and beyond, with Florida ranked second; Texas, third; Georgia, fifth; and North Carolina, seventh in overall job growth for the trailing 12 months ended February 2017.","Importantly, job growth in these key markets is accelerating faster than the United States average. Job growth is also important because it serves as a stimulant for construction activity for all end users: residential, nonresidential and infrastructure. The residential marketplace, which accounted for 22% of our first quarter aggregates product line shipments, is benefiting from continued economic recovery, particularly in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas and Florida. We see no evidence of these positive trends reversing and consequently, it's our belief that we will witness steady, multi-year residential demand growth.","Overall, housing starts remain well below the historical average of 1.5 million per year. Further, important Martin Marietta metros continue to outperform the national average with cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Denver and Raleigh leading the country in new permitting activity. We're also encouraged by increasing levels of single-family housing permits in many of our key metro markets, with Dallas, Atlanta, Austin, Tampa, Orlando and Charlotte, comprising the top six performers nationally. By its nature, single family housing and related subdivision development activity are considerably more aggregate intensive than our multifamily construction.","We also see broad positive trends in non-residential growth. North Carolina, Georgia and Texas, continue to benefit from improving economies, consistent job gains and large corporate relocations, all of which fuel construction activity. Consistent with this data, as of March 2017, the Dodge Momentum Index was at an eight-year high, signaling continued non-residential growth.","Turning to infrastructure, we remain confident that the benefits of federal, state and local funding increases, including those in the $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, will have positive impacts on infrastructure construction activity in 2017 and beyond.","Critically important examples of these state and local-led initiatives include the record Florida Department of Transportation budget of nearly $11 billion, the emerging impact of Georgia's State House Bill 170, which is expected to double their state-level transportation construction investment and Colorado Spring's local 2C sales-tax initiative, adding tens of millions of dollars of incremental infrastructure investment in that community.","As a reminder, the 2017 guidance we provided in February and reaffirm today does not reflect any benefits that may be gained from potential legislation, increasing federal infrastructure investment, nor does it include any benefits gained from actions taken to reduce businesses' regulatory burden. In fact, while we're encouraged by the emerging bipartisan views articulated in Washington regarding the need for substantial investment in our nation's infrastructure, in the near term, we believe the pace of highway construction activity may actually benefit more from regulatory relief.","The ability for states to bring projects forward and expedite large project approvals should generate increased product demand in both the near and long-term. In line with our stated capital allocation priorities, we invested $102 million of capital in our businesses and returned $127 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 458,000 shares of our common stock, together with our quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share.","As a reminder, since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015, we've returned more than $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Further, we have 14.6 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization.","Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 2017 was 1.9 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant. As we look forward to the remainder of 2017 and beyond, our profitability outlook is the strongest we've ever seen. Our expectation for increased levels of construction activity across our three primary end use markets is underpinned by employment gains in our top markets and consistent with third-party forecasters.","Our longer-term view is consistent with those of Dodge data and analytics and the PCA, which both forecast growth in construction starts for 2017 and the next several years. These trends support our confidence in the durability of what we view as the ongoing multi-year construction recovery. Again, consistent with the full year guidance we provided in February, we expect aggregates product line infrastructure shipments to increase in the mid-single-digits.","Nonresidential volumes are expected to increase in the low to mid-single-digits. Residential shipments are expected to increase in the mid to high-single-digits and ChemRock\/Rail shipments are expected to be stable. On a consolidated basis, we expect to deliver another record year with net sales ranging from $3.750 billion to $3.950 billion, a further expansion of gross profit and increased EBITDA ranging from $1.050 billion to $1.130 billion.","Additionally, in this morning's release, we increased our capital expenditure guidance range from $350 million to a range of $400 million to $500 million as we anticipate the acceleration of certain capital projects to further prepare our operations for increased demand for our products. In conclusion, we not only delivered strong first quarter results, but we also made timely investments in our business and set the stage for us to continue to capitalize on the additional construction demand we see across the vast majority of our markets throughout 2017 and beyond.","As the construction recovery broadens, we're well-positioned to deliver increasing shareholder value from our network of quarries, distribution yards and plants. Martin Marietta remains focused on the careful execution of our strategic plan and wholly committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, ethical conduct, operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction and sustainability.","If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thank you for taking my questions today. The first quick question on volumes. Could you help us walk through the volume flow through inter-quarter and how this compares to what would be a typical calendar Q1?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Kathryn, what we're delighted to say is this finally does look like a more typical Q1. So if we think about what happened last year, we came out of the gate very strong in January and February and things started pulling back modestly in March. That's exactly the opposite that we saw this year. We saw that both in aggregates and in cement as well. So what we've said for a long time, Kathryn, and really I've captured some of it in the commentary that we published today as well, the last two weeks of March usually make or break the quarter.","And what we saw this year was frankly, we were considerably behind in January. You would expect that. We closed the gap, but we're still considerably behind when we finished February and then, really, we finished that March in March. So if we think about the way just on the cement side \u2013 and you can take some of this and extrapolate it to the aggregates side. In Texas, cement volumes were down in January 14% for the overall marketplace, for us down 7%, for the overall marketplace down 12%, for us down 17%. Then in March, for the overall marketplace, up 17%; for us, it was up 20%.","So if we think about the two places in particular that we saw a pop in aggregates in the first quarter, it was really twofold: one, Southeast because in large part we're getting ready for what we believe will be a very busy year in Florida this year; and two, in the Rocky Mountains. They had a very good quarter in the first quarter. And part of what I was really excited to see in that is we put up good pricing numbers in the first quarter despite the fact that actually Colorado, which you'll recall as one of our lower-priced states, actually came out of the box disproportionally good on volumes. So that's the way the quarter built, Kathryn, both from an aggregate side and the cement side.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you. I want to shift to margins. Could you walk through some of the greatest drivers for some of the margin compression we saw in Q1? And in particular, it'd be helpful to better understand how much was more related to just lower volumes, just from fixed cost leverage, if volumes being flattish in total versus higher cost in that preparation for the spring construction season that you mentioned in your prepared commentary.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Sure. Kathryn, let me start with the notion that we're firmly committed to what we said. We're going to hit 60% incremental margins on average as we recover the first half of volume from that 80 million ton decline that we saw. So let's start with that. If you look at what we're anticipating through our guidance, what we're expecting is almost a 200 basis point improvement in our full-year consolidated gross margin as we look across the business for the full year.","As far as the first quarter was concerned, really two different things drove the margin performance. Number one, we saw a $6 million increase in personnel. And what does that mean? It means number one, we've got some businesses operating this year in the first quarter that we didn't have operating last year in the first quarter.","Number two, we have been working more hours as well because frankly, we're trying to put material on the ground because here's the high-class problem, Kathryn. I think there are going to be certain markets this year that we're going to see stone shortages in. So the importance to put material on the ground, we think was important.","That was $6 million. We had an additional $4 million in grading. And what does that mean? It means we're opening up reserves, so we can be in a position to access those reserves and process it as efficiently as possible. So that's $6 million and $4 million; that gets you to $10 million.","We also had $2 million in higher freight costs. That was principally moving material from South Georgia by rail into Florida as we anticipate that economy being really quite good this year. So if we back out those $12 million on increased personnel, contract grading and higher freight costs, we would have been right there at the 60% incremental gross margin. So I think that addresses your question specifically.","One other item of note that I'd like to say is we grew the top line by $58 million or $36 million or 62% of that growth was from ready mixed concrete and two-thirds of the ready mixed concrete was growth from new acquisitions, meaning the Ratliff transaction that we did in Texas last year. So what I think you've seen us do with ready mixed business is as we've taken them through our process, as you have seen those margins get better over time.","So I think the effect was two-fold. One, what was the investment? And that's the way that we see it in the aggregates business to be ready for the rest of the year, and then you did have a little bit of an early shift on ready mixed. So again, our confidence in what's going to happen with those incremental margins is still very high. But I hope that responsive, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yes, that is. And then final question, and you touched on it just briefly in your response, is just more on product availability. Something that we are hearing more consistently, we've heard in spot markets last year, but more consistently is a potential of a tightening of clean stone supply as we head into the spring construction season. Could you just maybe share some comments? Are you seeing that? And what have you done to prepare for this possibility? And when was the last time you even have seen this happen?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Okay. We'll start with the concept; it's a nice problem, right, Kathryn? It's been a long time since we've had that issue. It's probably been in decade-ish since we've that issue. Do I think we're going to see that in some markets this year? The answer is yes. Do I think it's likely that portions of Colorado will see it? Yeah. Do I think it's possible portions of the Midwest, meaning parts of Iowa, will see that? I think so. Is it possible that you may see that in parts of the Mid-America Group as well? So the East Coast of the United States. I think so. So if we're looking at potential shortages later in the year, I would suggest it's probably in those three different divisions. And again, if you're asking what we're doing in advance of it, I think it goes right back to these numbers that I went through with you in the answer to your second question, and that is we're putting stone on the ground, we're investing in people to make sure that we're in the ability to meet that market need as much as we can as we go forward.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thanks so much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. Just have a question first off, on your guidance. Just given the strength in volume, particularly later in March, which Ward, you indicated is usually instructive for full-year momentum. Just wondering as to the thoughts behind maintaining your volume guidance at this point as opposed to potential upside just given how demand accelerated as the quarter progressed?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah, I guess, our sense on that, Garik, was we just want to remember that we're three months in. So our primary view is let's come back and see where we are at half-year. And then if it's appropriate to adjust our guidance at that time, we certainly can. But again, if you're gleaning from my comments and from the release that at least sitting where we sit right now, we have a very favorable outlook for the year, I think that's entirely right. But I think we saw a lot of folks get excited last year after Q1 and probably get a little bit ahead of themselves, and we didn't want to do that this year.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. I wanted to shift to pricing. If you could just talk about two regions that were both above and below your, I guess, consolidated results, the Southeast Group and the double-digit pricing gains in the West Group, which had low-single digit pricing gains. Was there any mix impact in either of those two regions that stand out? I'd just like to get some thoughts on those two markets.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, I guess, a couple of things. One, I think both those markets from a pricing perspective are in a pretty healthy place. Number two, we did indicate we were sending more material into Florida this year. And of course, that's going to be freight impacted material because in large part it's moving by rail, going into that marketplace, so there would be some push there, but very, very small, Garik. So I don't want you to get ahead of yourself on that.","The other thing that I would say relative to the West is twofold. One, I mentioned in my early comments that there's a lot of activity in Colorado, so if we pause and say, okay, if you've got good activity in Colorado, great market for Martin Marietta, but still one of its lower-priced aggregates market. So you are going to see a little bit of an optical headwind on West pricing there. Number two, and this is fascinating; we actually saw volume actually go up modestly in Houston, which I think is a good sign because part of what we had believed is that Houston has found bottom in that marketplace.","At the same time, I did indicate in my commentary that we saw less going into South Texas. And again, that was driven by the roll-off of some of those very large LNG plays last year. Again, we think there's more in the queue, and we think that's coming later this year, probably more of an impact next year. But again, when you're talking about South Texas, those two are freight adjusted movements that are going there. So there is some modest mix in those. I think the last piece I would call out to you is we did have more April 1 price increases this year, particularly in portions of Texas. So again, as we're sitting here looking at pricing, Garik, of the things that I have some degree of latent concerns about, pricing is not on that list.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, thanks. And my last question is just on the increase in the CapEx guidance. Could you help us understand where specifically the increase is coming from? And how should we think about CapEx long-term given the step up in 2016?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah, I guess I would say this. I'll tell you what it is. I won't tell you necessarily where it is with great precision. The big thing that's driving it, Garik, is real estate. We have the opportunity in some places that are important to us to make some generational purchases of land. And obviously in the business that we're in, making sure you control your future through having land in the right places is strictly important to us. So there are a handful of real estate transactions out there that really drove the big change in that.","What I would say going back to your broader question on where we will be overall through a cycle, remember the way that we typically talk about CapEx. Stay-in-business CapEx and DD&A are numbers that are relatively even with each other. So for us, let's call it $275 million, $280 million worth of DD&A and stay-in-business CapEx.","Obviously, as we went through the down cycle, we pulled back on CapEx. You saw us spending CapEx below DD&A for a number of years. You should expect us to be above DD&A for a number of years, particularly in this type of environment because if we're entering a phase that we may have issues keeping enough stone on the ground, again, that's a nice issue for us.","From a capital expenditure perspective, if we ignore what we just discussed on the land, much of what we're doing is addressing rolling stock right now because fixed plant, as you recall, we had the capacity in old Martin Marietta before TXI to put 205 million tons of stone on the ground. So we can put that through our plants very, very quickly and very easily, but making sure we can hit stone starved areas, and a good example of it is what we're doing in Northern Colorado with the rail yard that we're putting in the marketplace right now, is important for us.","So some of it's land, some of it's tied to distribution and some of it's tied to rolling stock. But hopefully, that gives you a sense through a cycle. I think if we ignore the real estate issues, Garik, I think that range that we'd given you before of around $350 million is right in the sweet spot.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Helpful. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Garik.","Operator","Our next question comes from Blake Hirschman with Stephens, Inc.","Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Ward and Anne.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hey, Blake.","Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.","My first question, you and some of your primary competition have spoken optimistically about the M&A pipeline and the likelihood that activity might begin to ramp here. Just wondering if there's any update today that you could provide us with.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what I continue to think that this is a year that there will be a lot of conversation. And it makes sense. Again, we've spoken about the fact that while the cycle's nowhere near what we would've seen previously as peaking, it's clearly a lot better than it was seven or eight years ago. So I think there are closely held family businesses that are thinking about generationally where they want to be in their business. And I think there are others who are thinking about whether this is or is not a good exit point. So, obviously, we're interested in growing our business.","But, as you know, we're very consistent with our planning process. Where we are matters a lot to us and assuring that we're putting ourselves in the right markets, and as I said in the prepared commentary, with the right people and the right resources, is vitally important to us. So it's not just any transaction that we're going to be looking at. We're looking at what we feel like are the deals that are the right deals for this company that make us better, not necessarily bigger. But I continue to believe this is a year that you could see some fairly significant transaction activity potentially.","Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then on the ready mixed side of the business, how do you think about the margins on that piece through the cycle? How do you look at the material spreads there? And should we expect that the material spreads will continue to expand with increasing input costs like the cement and aggregate costs? Thanks and good luck.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, thank you very much. Number one, we anticipate the ready mixed business, as it continues to mature in our portfolio will get up into that nice mid-teens type margin area. That's what we anticipated. That's the type of March that we're seeing. So I think as we look at that business, we're very comfortable with where we are. And again, keep in mind, our ready mixed business is really driven by two markets, in particular. It's what's happening in Texas and it's what's happening in portions of Colorado.","And remember, our ready mixed business is really only in two places, realistically, in Texas. It's a North Texas, Dallas-Fort Worth market and some in Central Texas and then up and down that front range in Colorado. So again, we're very careful about where we want to be in that vertically integrated business. As far as pricing commentary, because that's clearly been a nice driver for that business, what we're looking at in the marketplace, particularly in Texas right now, is a $6 to $8 a cubic yard price increase and we're seeing that in large part across all different end uses.","So again, we feel very good about where that market sits today. One of the things that I think it's fair to say, we are considering a price increase for both ready mixed and cement, again, in October, again, anticipating very, very busy markets in that end use for the balance of the year. So, Blake, I hope that helps.","Blake Hirschman - Stephens, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you, Ward.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hey. How are we doing, Jerry?","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Doing well, thanks. How are you?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Not bad.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ward, you spoke about improved volumes in March and I'm just wondering if you could talk about how broad-based that is. Obviously, you cited Texas with very good numbers. What proportion of your markets would you say were up year-over-year in March? And then if you can comment, the numbers that you cited in Texas for cement. Is that representative of your volumes in March in aggregates in Texas as well?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. It would move around a bit. Here's what I would say. If we look across our spectrum for the quarter, I see a lot more green than I do red. So let's just start with that. But clearly March was an important month for us. If we think about the way the different markets are performing in Texas, what I'll tell you is North Texas is clearly the most healthy market in that marketplace.","Back to the commentary that I was offering a few minutes ago in acquisitions, why where you are matters. Remember, 45% of our aggregate volume in Texas is in North Texas. So if we're going to have a market in Texas that's performing well, we'd like it to be DFW. So what I would tell you is the DFW market is strong. We think if it has a normal weather year this year, it will be very strong. Remember, I was talking about October price increases, again, in ready mixed in that marketplace.","As we look at the Central Texas market, that's really driven by what's happening in San Antonio and Austin, again, a very healthy marketplace. That's about 30% of our volume. If we look at the marketplace in Houston today, that's about 10% of our volume. And Houston, as I mentioned, we actually saw a volume pickup in the first quarter and we're pleased by that because again, we think Houston has found bottom. We did see South Texas lower.","And again, I'm not concerned about South Texas. I think what we're in is exactly what we described. It's an interim period. And I think given some of the large projects that we see coming in that marketplace in non-res in the latter part of 2017 and, frankly, more impactfully, into 2018, yeah, I think we're in a nice place from a volume perspective there. What I'm particularly excited about is what we're seeing in Georgia and Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina, because remember, Jerry, part of what we've said for years is when the bottom right-hand corner of that map for us gets healthier, it's disproportionally important.","And going back to one of the conversations I had with Kathryn early on in the call, some of those markets in the East we think we may see some stone shortages this year. And again, that's a very, very different point in the cycle for those markets that we've seen for a decade. So if we're seeing that type of activity here as we wrap up Q1, it's a nice place to be, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And, Ward, in terms of other pricing actions that you're considering, so you mentioned the Texas market should be supportive of price increases for aggregates and potentially in the East. Can you talk about other markets as well and the cadence of potential pricing actions this year? I think last year, you folks didn't push pricing over the course of a year, so you probably have some relatively easy pricing comps in the back half. Is that right?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, I think we'll clearly come back and talk to you more about that at half year. There are a number of markets this year that the price increases really didn't hit until April 1. So I think to the extent that they're mid-years, they're likely to be even later in the year than they typically would have been because some of the ones really didn't start this year until April 1. So I think that's probably a conversation when we're having the next one of these calls, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, guys, for taking my call \u2013 question. Going back to the Southeastern market, I mean, obviously, great growth there. Where would you guess we are in recovery to quote a normalized sort of a market within that piece?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I would tell you that we're still early in that. I mean, it's always interesting. Despite the fact that we live in basketball territory, we usually think of things relative to innings. And if we're looking at where we are on the Southeast, I think we're probably in the fourth inning. And by the way, that's a game that can play extra innings down there as well, so I'm not sure fourth is really that late.","And think of it in these terms, Stanley. Georgia and Florida today are truly one of the best economies in the nation, but I think each one has plenty of room to grow. I mentioned in the opening comments that the House Bill 170 benefits in Georgia should visibly emerge this year. As in other markets, what we're seeing right now is increased non-res activity and investment in distribution and warehouse facilities so along interstate corridors and airport hub locations. So if you're thinking about what you're seeing in that whole corridor from Atlanta, down into the Orlando, Tampa area, it's doing exceptionally well with that.","But there's some other things that strike me right now. For example, Alabama is actually considering raising its gas tax to begin addressing years of under investment in that work. But critically, what we're seeing in both res and non-res work in Georgia is very strong. And what we're seeing on I-4 work in Florida. Remember, that felt some degrees of delays last year. So from our perspective, with an $11 billion DOT budget in Florida, a doubling of the DOT budget in Georgia, res in both those states that's performing very well, and in Georgia we care about that because we'll sell stone to it.","In Florida, while we may not sell stone to the res market, what it's doing is keeping others very much tied up in res and we can come back and really feed that large infrastructure market that's largely what we do. So, again, if you think back to a Georgia market that saw, say, 70% of its volume go away from peak to trough, if you think back to cycle, that's one reason that when we talk about innings, we're still talking very early in the innings, Stanley. I hope that helped.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","No, yeah and I agree. Switching gears to on the pricing piece, you had the March cement numbers were very, very good. Can you talk about the confidence that $8 per ton out there? Do you think that there was some pull-ahead trying to beat that increase, or just give your thoughts on the realization of that $8 as we're looking at the rest of the year?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? I think you're going to see realization work in different ways in that marketplace. And do I think the $8 works very well in Dallas-Fort Worth? Yeah. Do I think it's going to be a little bit less than that but not remarkably less than that in places like Waco and Austin and San Antonio and Corpus? Yeah, probably so, probably closer to that $5 to $6 area. I think parts of East Texas will likely see that $8 number. And I think one of the markets that will be tougher this year on cement will continue to be Houston.","But again, if you think about where our cement plants are, one in Midlothian and one at Hunter outside San Antonio, San Antonio and Dallas are the markets that will principally drive what we see in cement. And again, we see something there that's really very healthy. And we're back to the concept of I think those types increases that I just went through with you stick. And again, we're looking to come back and have a series of conversations about doing something, again, in October.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. And the last question, you mentioned something about the regulatory relief. If we think normally kind of an 18- to 24-month period following monies coming to the system, the excitement around the regulatory relief, is that that more projects will come to fold or is it that the duration of the vetting process gets curtailed down? Kind of thoughts around that, if you could, please.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I think the answer, Stanley, is yes. And I think what you end up are with less project delays, I think you end up with less project costs. And I think you end up with less opportunities for frivolous litigation. I actually had an opportunity to speak before a House committee here about a month or a month and a half ago and spoke very directly to some projects that I felt like had suffered from those very types of maladies. And I think to the extent that we see some degrees of regulatory reform around those, I think we can actually see more projects coming forward and more projects being put to work on the ground, which will need our products. So that's the way we look at that. I do genuinely believe that a highway build is important. But if we get regulatory reform right, it can be equally as impactful.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yep. Great. Well, thanks guys and best of luck.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Stanley.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, hey. Good morning, everyone.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hello, Timna.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. Just taking a step back, there was two things I wanted to think though regarding catalysts for the company going forward. One is really if you could remind us about your exposure in the energy paths in U.S. land stories, of course, progressing nicely forward. And I just wonder if you could remind us where you're seeing business there, or options for growth.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, as we look at what's going on in the energy patch right now, what I will tell you is our Q1 shale volumes were 315,000 tons. That was down 134,000 tons from prior year. And here's what I would tell you: we have put up just about record results in many respects in Q1, and I can tell you what was going on relative to energy in Q1 was almost immaterial to our business. So to the extent that we see things happening like they are in the Permian, and they start to get better across some of these other basins, they can be pretty impactful to us.","I mean, if I look across the spectrum at what was going on in Haynesville, the Barnett, the Heyworth, the Eagle Ford, et cetera, the only one that actually saw in our group any positive change was actually what was going on in Haynesville and I view that as actually a very good sign. That's more of a gas than it is a wet play. So if we're seeing that type of recovery, we think it's actually pretty important.","What I would tell you is I think normal shale demand should be 2 to 2.5 times the current levels. In other words for (44:04) 4 million tons a year. So if we think back to where it was last year, we finished full year 2016 at 1.4 million tons. We had finished 2014 at 7.4 million tons. So what I would tell you is if we go back to where it was in 2011 at 4 million tons or even in 2015 at 3.5 million tons, that, to me, feels more like it.","The other thing that strikes me that's different today is in the Eagle Ford, you've got profitable new wells with a WTI at 48 and existing wells are profitable at $29 and shale generally across the U.S. is profitable at $55 for a new well and $38 for existing. So if we think about the footprint that we have and our ability to move by rail, as that marketplace recovers, we should clearly benefit from that. But frankly, we haven't felt that yet.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is it possible that you're (45:08) market share opportunities given that the rig count is already doubled off the bottom? Is there a reason why you wouldn't have seen some improvement so far on that?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I think the big issue is, the big place that you're seeing that right now is in the Permian, and that's in West Texas, and that's really a play that's of the moment for us, Timna.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you, okay. And my other question was just I felt like it was topical to revisit the highway, the gas tax on a federal level. Do you believe that any of the high-level conversations there are going to be able to progress given some of the Republicans' stalwart opposition to any new taxes? Or do you think that we're going to need to continue to follow the state-led initiatives to raise gas taxes in lieu of the inaction of the federal side?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I guess I would say two-fold. Number one, I do think we will continue to see state action. So I think if we look at what's happened in Indiana this week, if we look at different conversations around gas taxes in states like South Carolina and Alabama. I mean, let's face it, Timna, if we're talking about raising gas taxes, South Carolina and Alabama would not have been at the head of the class on that conversation 25 years ago. So to the extent that we're seeing that, I think we continue to see it.","It's nice to see that the President articulated yesterday that he's open the prospect of a gas tax. I do think there are going to be some portions in the Republican caucus that will struggle with that. At the same time, what I would tell you, Timna, is I think there has been more constructive conversation about different ways to fund this long-term over the last six months to eight months, than we've seen for a long time. I do believe there's more broad consensus around the need for investment in infrastructure across the aisle than we've seen in healthcare and in some respects, in tax reform as well.","So I think when this comes up to bat, I think the likelihood of getting something that is serious relief and investment for the industry is there. I think the vehicles may be several-fold. I think the easiest way to address is gas tax. Do I think that's going to be the only way it's address? I don't. That's my quick take on it, Timna.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for all the disclosure and the CEO letter was a welcome addition. Thanks again.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you very much, Timna.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Hi, Ward.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Craig, how are you?","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","I am doing well. And your ready mixed operation had a terrific quarter, driving a lot of the overall quarter. What was the organic volume growth there?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, what the organic volume growth really wasn't that great. If we look at really what happened there, on a prior year variance, what was really driving was what we had in Mid-Central and the Mid-Central is really where that Ratliff business is. So if I look at what Mid-Central did prior year, we're up about, I want to say, it's 706,000 cubic yards in the marketplace all by itself. So really what we had was, from a revenue perspective, a much better volume heading out of what used to be the Ratliff business that we bought last year.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. So the organic volume (48:23) single-digit, is that...?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Again, we're talking first quarter of the year so you're never going to see huge volumes in ready mixed in Colorado. And so yes, it was exactly where we thought it would have been, but for what it came in relative to Ratliff.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then cement, I think I heard a mixed message of you had a terrific March, and that may be representative strength going into the remainder of the year. But was any of that increased volume related to the price increase that's coming in April?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","No, I don't much think so, Craig. I think what we saw was just a more normal, regular roll through the year. Here's the way that I really describe what we've seen so far this year. If I think back to 2015 or back to 2016, I think a wet second half in 2015 and perfect weather early in 2016 really created work early in 2016 that was wrapping up the 2015 construction season.","By contrast, I think what we've seen this year through the slow, steady, more normal built in the first quarter is we're building toward a very healthy 2017 season. So I don't look at what happened in March and right now, feel like I see something that feels anomalous. Right now what I'm seeing is something candidly, Craig, that just feels normal. And we've been waiting for something that looked more normal for a while, even if you think back to our commentary over the last couple of years on weather.","We've said we don't need great weather. We just need weather that's more normal. I think that's what we're seeing right now as we talk about these Q1 results.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then I think there's weather in Dallas right now. Are you guys seeing anything to upset that weather wise?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I guess, what I'll say is I don't think I'm telling state secrets when I say that April I think has been wet for a lot of the country. At the same time, you haven't seen us move anything on guidance either. So, I think, look you can watch NOAA, just like I can, and you get a sense of what's going on out there. But again, if we look at what the underlying demand is for the balance of the year, we feel very good.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And you talked a little bit about infrastructure legislation and the potential for a federal gas tax. Any progress with the BOLT Act?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","That process is going about the way that we would have anticipated. We have a lot of people who have signed on to support it. The money from across industries to make sure that members of Congress understand that I think has been extraordinary. I think it has good, broad, uniform support. And going back to the commentary that I was offering to Timna, that's part of what I'm speaking to when I say I think you've seen a host of innovative and different thought processes coming forward, and those are some of the reasons that I feel confident we will see some degree of regulatory relief relative to infrastructure and investment moving forward. So yes, BOLT has I think reasonable progress behind it right now, Craig.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","All right. All right. Thanks a lot, Ward.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schrier with Citi.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm taking a look at your capital allocation. And I'm curious to see if this \u2013 the increase in your CapEx guidance affects the way you're thinking about, whether it's buybacks or your M&A activity, whether you're putting more money into the ground versus buying back your shares?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, I guess what I would say, Scott, is we've always said that our priority is doing the right deal first. So if we find the right transactions, and we can get the types of returns on the right transactions, those will be our number one priorities.","Number two, making sure we can really grow this organic business in the right way. Again, I'm not wanting to talk specifically about what the real estate deals are because I think in a competitive world, that's just unwise. But I can tell you if we had investors looking over our shoulder saying, these are what we're looking at, I don't think they'd have any problem with that whatsoever.","And the other nice problem that we have, you see what cash flow looked like, you can see what we did during the quarter in share buybacks, and you can see where we are relative to our ratio. So I think our capital priority allocation and strategies remain entirely the same. I think if there's in fact one thing that I think we have been remarkably consistent on it's that portion of our story.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then I want to follow up a little bit more on the comments on the stone shortage. So it sounds like, if I'm understanding it correctly, that you might be able to push pricing maybe toward the higher end of your guidance. But right now, you're keeping your EBITDA guidance and gross profit guidance the same. And I recognize it's only one quarter. But, one, is there opportunity you think to maybe exceed some of the pricing side of things? And conversely, is that going to be offset by any constraints, whether we see tightening, whether it's on rail and the labor supply? How do those coalesce in this equation?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. I guess I would say the following. If we think about the areas that I mentioned earlier, that I think you could see some stone shortages. We did talk about Colorado and one thing that's important to remember that, again, that's one of our lowest priced aggregate markets. So if we see pricing opportunities there, and I'm not sure what they can look like, again, you're just talking about moving a marketplace up closer to a corporate average. We also spoke about what could be potential shortages in the Midwestern United States and the Midwestern is typically right at the corporate average, just to give you a sense of that.","And as we come back and talk about portions of the Mid-Atlantic, they tend to be above the corporate average. So what's interesting, as you go through it and think about it, Scott, is you have markets that I think could be tight this year, one of which is below, one of which is spot on and one of which is modestly above. So depending on what degrees of short we may or may not see, that's going to drive as much of that as anything. So that's the way that I would encourage you to think about that.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And are you seeing any issues from labor possibly having an impact on volumes?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","For us, not so much. We're not seeing significant issues outside of portions of Texas where labor is tight, particularly North Texas. Labor is getting tighter in portions of Georgia right now as well. And part of what we tried to this year, if you look at the costs that were up in the first quarter, some of that was driven by the fact that we wanted to put more material on the ground. We were also able to keep some of our people busy throughout the winter, which I think right now is an awfully helpful thing for our people and places us, I think, in a better strategic position relative to head count and personnel.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Great quarter.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Adam, very much.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Hey, Ward. On the Q4 call, you said a normal Q1 would be kind of 5% to 7% of full-year gross profit. Based upon the Q1 just reported and the guidance, it's 13% to 15% this year. I'm just wondering if that tends to suggest that the full-year guidance is conservative.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, I guess, Adam, what I'd say is we'll come back and take a look at that at half year and see where we are. Look, if we look out for the balance of the year, if we have normal weather, and we don't have some big shock to the overall U.S. economy from something, we're in a very attractive place. Part of my commentary said, I think we're in the most attractive spot that we've been maybe in this company's history.","So I do think it's too early based on one quarter to do much relative to the guidance. And we do want to be careful and thoughtful around that. But as I indicated as well, when we finished January, we were considerably behind. When we finished February, we were considerably behind. Mind you, behind prior year, not necessarily behind plan. And then we were behind when we got to the halfway point of March and then the afterburners kicked in. So again, it depends on how that rhythm and cadence goes for the rest of the year, but it should be an attractive year, Adam.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then I wanted to ask on the infrastructure side. If I look at the Census Bureau construction put in place numbers for highway and street, it's down 2% on average over the past 12 months. I'm just wondering if that's indicative of what you've seen in your states. And if I'm hearing you correctly, that headwind turns into a tailwind later this year.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, I guess what I would say, Adam, if you think about our different states, and let's just march through the top ones, I mean, I don't see anything slower with TxDOT. And if anything, what I see is TxDOT really having gotten through, maybe not all the issues they had last year in putting work out, but a significant piece of it. So do I think there's going to be good infrastructure work in Texas, our largest state by revenue? Yes. Do I think there's going to be good infrastructure work in Colorado, up and down the I-25 corridor? Absolutely. Do I think those transactions that we did last year in Southern Colorado or in Colorado Springs for that 2C sales tax initiative, will do exceptionally well in infrastructure? I do.","If we come to our third state by revenue and look at North Carolina, do I think we're going to have a better infrastructure year in this state with activity building, for example, on I-77 throughout the year and I-85? I do. If we go to our fifth largest state by revenue and really take Florida and then flow in \u2013 I'm sorry, Georgia, then flow into Florida, again, I think we're going to see the real impact of House Bill 170 this year in Georgia and I think, look, we've got an $11 billion record DOT spend in Florida. And then if we go up to Indiana, and keep in mind, by the time we rack up those states, we're over 70% of our revenues. And Indiana is just looking at ways and they've just passed a way to put even more money into infrastructure.","And remember, our marketplace in Indiana is really driven almost uniquely by Indianapolis. So if I'm looking at what's going on relative to infrastructure, highways, bridges, roads and streets, and I'm looking at our geography and again, back to this notion of where you are matters, I like where we are relative to public work, but I got to tell you, I like where we are relative to private work as well. I don't think I'd want to trade our portfolio with anybody today.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Great. Okay. Thanks, Ward.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Norfleet with Alembic Global.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good afternoon, Ward and Anne. Congratulations on a great quarter.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Rob, thank you.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Just quickly, Ward, back on the cement question. So you guys have been consistently at about a 21% market share. And I know you've said that that's a good place to be, but do you see some opportunities to increase market share, especially in the North Texas market?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","We're very comfortable with where we are in that marketplace. And look, we're looking for efficiencies in that marketplace. Clearly, we've got a large vertically-integrated presence there as well. Okay?","I like the way that business is working. I like the leadership that we have there throughout the State of Texas, in every component. But let's face it, that cement business, that very strategic cement business that we bought at mid-2014 has probably done what anybody would have thought and several percentages better. So again, Rob, we're very peaceful with that.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay, great, and just my last question deals with on the infrastructure side. We're hearing a lot from civil contractors as well as design engineers of the emergence of P3 partnerships and it had become a larger funding source for infrastructure-related work. How do you see this funding mechanism playing out as a viable option for projects?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what, Rob? I think it plays out just fine in large metropolitan areas. And I think it plays out not as well in the flyover states. And here's what I would say on that. Can you build more toll roads in Florida? Yeah. Can you do it in Georgia? Yeah. Can you do it in parts of North Carolina or New York or Chicago or other big cities?","I think when you're looking at P3 in those places where you have to get some degree of return back, and it's typically driven by tolls, I think it works remarkably well. I think if you're looking at Des Moines and Omaha and parts of Middle-America, I think it gets considerably trickier.","So I think we're going to have to have a very different conversation around what is investment and what is funding. And I think P3 is going to be driven by investment and I think you're going to see that disproportionately on each coast and along the Gulf, and I think you're going to have greater funding needs on everyplace in between.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rohit Seth with SunTrust.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the guidance, you mentioned a lot about that already, but is it fair to say the first quarter was ahead of your internal plan at the end of March?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","It's fair to say that at the end of March, it was ahead of plan. I think that's an entirely fair observation.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And could you provide any colors on April?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? I'll tell you more about April when we come out at half year. I did indicate, I guess, in my earlier commentary that I don't think we were giving away the store when we said some parts of the United States, it's been wet. But at the same time, you haven't seen us do anything to take down our guidance either. So, more on April when we're together with you at half year.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you. Okay. And my next is on the resi construction. I know it's earlier in the year and you had a good start. I just wanted to get a sense of how you think about the rest of the year connecting that 20%-plus growth and then your high-single digit growth on the guide.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","From where we're sitting right now, I look at two different things. One, I look at permitting activity and I look at starts. And what I would encourage too to remember is, if we're looking at permitting activity outside of New York and New Jersey, permitting activity is really very attractive right now. So if we're looking at the type of activity that we're seeing in housing in places like Dallas, Raleigh, Denver, Minneapolis and Atlanta, and keep in mind we've got seven of the top 10 metros in our footprint, including those top five players.","If we look at single-family permits, Martin Marietta metros account for seven of the top 10, including all of the top six. And if we're looking at multi-family, our metros account for six of the top 10, including Denver at number one, Dallas at number two and Raleigh at number three. What I think could be at the moment here, is you are going to slowly see, and we've seen this trend move from west to east, you're going to see a trend of less multifamily and more single family. And from where we sit, that's important because single family's clearly considerably more aggregate intensive than is multifamily.","So if we're, again, looking at where we are, and you think back to those leading states, and you think about population dynamics in Texas and Colorado and Georgia and North Carolina and South Carolina and then you say okay what will housing look like in those states given those population dynamics, we think that's going to be attractive, and we think that's going to be attractive for a while. And it's one of the reasons that we talk about housing relative to what does a 50-year average look like, because we're still looking this year at something that's going to be well below a 50-year average. But economists vary on this. And I've heard economists say that we're heading toward 1.4 million, 1.5 million, or maybe 1.6 million [starts] in this cycle, but clearly, we don't anticipate being that over 2 million in the cycle, and frankly that would not be a healthy place for the United States to be, but where we're building right now, we're very comfortable.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And was there an increase in the lot development you're seeing relative to just homebuilding?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","There is. So the way that we've seen that roll over time, Rohit, is we would see multifamily come back first, we would see single-family infill come after that and then we would see relatively large purchases of land for subdivision activity, and that's what we're seeing particularly in the Carolinas and Georgia right now. That's what we were seeing in Texas three and four years ago; that's what we're seeing in Colorado today. So again, we're now seeing that type of housing activity spread to that bottom right-hand corner of the map that we keep coming back to. Because what's happening is the southeast is returning with a rhythm and a cadence consistent with what we had anticipated we thought we would see. And whether it's infrastructure, non-res or res, all of that's important to us in that marketplace.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got you. And then on Georgia, more specifically Atlanta, we had the I-85 bridge collapse down here. And I think the GDOT froze some construction activity. Do you think it's going to impact your second quarter or is it too little?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? I think it's probably too early to tell. But I don't think that's going to be at the moment.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then, the last question on the FAST Act, it looks like Congress is going to fully fund the transportation budget. And I'm trying to think about how FAST Act rolled out last year, how the incremental dollar from the 2017 budget is going to play out this year. How do you guys think about all that?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah, I think the primary way we think about that is you're going to have a much more mature Act ahead of you this year, and you're going to see construction activity on things that were being bid last year. So, again, I think you just go back to the normal, as we've said before, the normal rhythm and cadence of the percentage rollouts after new highway build, I think that's what we're going to see at the national level. I think the swing factor for us will be what we're seeing at the state level because there's so much amped up activity in key Martin Marietta states.","Rohit Seth - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks. That's all I had.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ward for closing comments.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you again for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings call. As you can tell, we're optimistic about the future for Martin Marietta, and we believe we're well poised to deliver great results in 2017 and the next several years.

I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ward Nye, President and CEO. You may begin.","C. Howard Nye","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As you saw in our press release, our third quarter 2013 results delivered double-digit growth in both net sales and earnings per diluted share. In a few moments, I'll provide the details for the quarter, our outlook for the balance of this year, as well as our preliminary thoughts regarding 2014.","But first, as a reminder, today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our earnings release related to our third quarter 2013 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available both on our own and the SEC websites.","Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website. Now for our discussion.","I'm pleased to report that our results represent a record in terms of sales for any third quarter. Our consolidated net sales of $600 million were up 12% over the prior-year quarter. This growth was driven by volume and pricing improvements in the aggregate product line and a new third quarter net sales record for the Specialty Products business. The ability to leverage higher net sales, together with our company's inherent cost-containment culture, resulted in gross margin improvement and a net earnings per diluted share of $1.54, a 13% increase over the prior-year quarter.","Our strong overall performance reflects gains in all of our product areas. Specifically, our Aggregates product line shipments increased 8.1% over the prior quarter, driven by strong private sector construction activity. Notably, 3 of our 4 end-use markets, which, together, comprise slightly more than half of our Aggregates volume, reported double-digit growth in shipments over the prior-year quarter. The nonresidential market led the way with a 19% increase, with growth in both the commercial construction and energy sectors. In fact, the strength of domestic shale gas production led to a 27% increase in shipments during the quarter. Estimated full year 2013 production at the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas is 1.4 million barrels. We expect this trend to continue as annual oil production at the Eagle Ford is expected to double in the next 5 years, reaching 3.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per year by 2025.","The residential market continued to benefit from year-over-year improvement in housing starts and permits, experiencing a 15% increase in shipments, highlighting the resiliency of the ongoing housing market recovery in our key markets.","Lastly, the ChemRock and Rail market experienced higher ballast shipments and reported a 13% increase in aggregates volume.","We achieved solid third quarter results despite headwinds in public sector construction. Ironically, the public sector infrastructure end-use market, traditionally a strong market, is experiencing a temporary period of stagnation, and shipments to this market were relatively flat compared with prior-year quarter. This stagnation can be traced to governmental disputes, primarily at the federal level, where budget and deficit disagreements and sequester have led to uncertainty regarding future federal highway funding levels beyond the September 2014 expiration of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21. As a result, states and municipalities are reluctant to commit to large-scale infrastructure projects.","While we still expect several of our key states, notably Texas, North Carolina and Florida, to benefit from the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA, component of MAP-21, the pace of these awards has been slower than expected. To date, only 2 TIFIA awards have been made, likely further delayed by October's government shutdown. That said, we're cautiously optimistic that this stalemate in Washington is transitory in nature as most Americans want safe and efficient transportation infrastructure. Realistically, though, we're not counting on any meaningful impact from TIFIA before the second half of 2014 and, more notably, in 2015.","As we look forward into 2014 and through the next construction cycle, we believe growth in private sector construction and increased TIFIA awards will lead to increased earnings. Additionally, when there's more clarity on federal funding, infrastructure spending should stimulate complementary public sector construction and, subsequently, our earnings potential.","As noted, aside from federal level concerns, we are encouraged by actions taken at both state and municipal levels to advance investment in the growing infrastructure needs of their citizens. As an example, voters in 3 regions in the southern part of Georgia approved the 10-year special purpose local option sales tax to fund transportation improvements. This tax went into effect at the beginning of the year, and we anticipate the pace of the projects funded by this initiative to accelerate going into 2014.","By further example, infrastructure activity in Indiana is a case study in innovative financing to meet state transportation needs. In 2005, former Indiana governor, Mitch Daniels, launched a 10-year transportation plan, known as Major Moves. Funded principally by the long-term lease of the Indiana Toll Road, Major Moves committed billions of dollars to infrastructure improvement. As Major Moves reaches its 2015 expiration, the Indiana Legislature continues to invest in infrastructure. In the recent 2013 legislative session, $215 million was targeted to new road funding from the dedication of a 1% sales tax, together with highway budget changes. Additionally, $400 million of general fund appropriations are being set aside for Major Moves 2020 trust fund to expand highway projects that enhance the movement of goods. Thus Indiana's vision and implementation of infrastructure investment as the pillar for economic growth provides a solid foundation in our Indianapolis market, as well as a model for others to emulate.","We also expect a significant reconstruction effort along portions of the front range in Colorado in response to recent flooding. The cost to repair and rebuild roads, bridges and homes is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. At the moment, many of our employees and customers were impacted by this disaster, and we've been working where we can with our friends and colleagues, as well as local communities, municipalities and the state of Colorado to assist in this massive recovery effort.","Our pricing momentum continued during the quarter, with each product line at the Aggregates business reporting increases. The Aggregates product line achieved pricing growth in each reportable segment, leading to an overall price increase of 2.3%. Pricing was strongest in the Mid-America Group, led by the Carolinas and Indiana markets. Our vertically integrated business has also achieved pricing growth, with the ready-mix concrete and hot mixed asphalt product lines reporting increases of 7% and 1.6%, respectively.","Our Specialty Products business continued its strong performance, delivering record third-quarter results with net sales of $55.8 million, an increase of 13% over the prior-year quarter. Sales growth reflects the increased sales of dolomitic lime provided by our new kiln capacity that became operational in the fourth quarter of 2012.","On a consolidated basis, gross margin was 23.8%, a 70-basis point improvement over the prior-year quarter. We've leveraged net sales growth into a 140-basis point expansion of gross margin for the Aggregates business. All 3 reportable segments achieved margin growth, led by 200-basis point increases for the Southeast and West groups.","Margin growth for the Mid-America Group was led by the Mid-Atlantic Division, where an 8% increase in Aggregates shipments, once again translated into incremental gross margins exceeding our publicly stated expectations.","Gross margin improvement for the Aggregates business was tempered by a 2.6% increase in direct production cost per ton for the Aggregates product line. The primary drivers of the increase were 2 atypical expenses, 1 related to the Colorado flooding and the second to specific workers' compensation matters. We also saw increased repairs in certain districts.","Gross margin for the Specialty Products business was 35.7%, affected by planned maintenance costs at the Woodville, Ohio operation and higher cost for coal when compared to the prior-year period.","Selling, general and administrative expenses were $37.1 million for the quarter or 6.2% of net sales. The increase of $5 million over the prior-year quarter was partially attributable to higher pension expenses and a planned information systems upgrade that was completed in October. This investment in first grade information systems provides an important tool for our managers and has helped to allow us to differentiate ourselves from others in our industry.","Consolidated earnings from operations were $100.8 million compared with $91.5 million in the prior-year quarter. In July, we completed the acquisition of 3 quarries in the Atlanta, Georgia market. The transaction added more than 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves and enhanced our position in this key rebounding market. As we previously stated, our goal is to have a #1 or #2 position in markets with near and long-term attractive economic drivers. This transaction is wholly consistent with that strategic objective.","For the first 9 months of the year, we generated operating cash flow of $165.6 million, an increase of over $40 million.","In addition to the Georgia acquisition, we invested $102 million in capital projects while maintaining our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At September 30, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.06x, in compliance with the limits under our debt covenant.","As we head toward 2013's conclusion, we're encouraged by positive trends in our business and markets, especially private sector employment and construction. For the full year 2013, we anticipate Aggregates volume to the nonresidential end-use market will increase in the mid-single digits, given that the Architecture Billing Index, a leading economic indicator for nonresidential construction activity, remains at a strong level. Residential construction is experiencing growth not seen since late 2005, with seasonally adjusted starts ahead of any period since 2008, driving our residential end-use market to the high-single digit volume growth.","By contrast, the weather-related slowdown in Aggregates shipments experienced in the first half of the year, coupled with government austerity and the hesitancy created by the uncertainty of federal highway spending, leads us to expect Aggregates shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to be down in the mid-single digits for the full year.","Our ChemRock\/Rail end-use market is expected to be flat for [ph] 2012. Cumulatively, dependent on fourth quarter weather, we anticipate Aggregates product line shipments will be flat to slightly up compared with 2012 levels.","We also expect Aggregates product line pricing to increase 2% to 4%, although this increase will not be uniform across the company.","Aggregates product line direct production cost per ton are expected to be slightly up compared with 2012.","Our vertically integrated businesses should generate between $335 million and $355 million of net sales and $18 million to $20 million of gross profit.","Net sales for the Specialty Products segment should range from $220 million to $230 million, generating $81 million to $85 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices are 2 key drivers for this segment.","SG&A expenses, excluding costs in 2013 and 2012 related to the information systems upgrade as a percentage of net sales, are expected to remain relatively flat.","Interest expense should remain consistent with 2012. Our estimated income tax rate is 26%, excluding discrete events.","Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $155 million.","While still early, we started to frame our initial outlook for 2014. Based on McGraw-Hill Construction's recent economic forecast, together with our own market view, we expect shipments for all Aggregates end-use markets to increase compared with 2013. Infrastructure market shipments should increase slightly. We anticipate the nonresidential market will experience mid- to high-single digit volume growth, with continued strength in both the commercial component and the energy sector. We expect shipments to the residential market to have double-digit growth based on the trend in housing starts. Finally, we expect the ChemRock and Rail market to increase slightly.","To conclude, we believe significant upside exists in our markets and Martin Marietta has demonstrated an ability to translate this improved macroeconomic environment into increased sales, earnings, earnings per share and cash flow. As noted, our future confidence is underscored by the growth of private sector construction activity that's spreading geographically. Nonresidential growth is predicted to accelerate, especially as more states and municipalities get support and votes from their constituents to make infrastructure improvements, thus providing what is typically a greater proportion of more aggregates-intensive projects.","We're also cautiously confident that public sector activity will begin to grow and then expand as the overall economy recovers. Historically, infrastructure investment has been an area of political consensus. And while we've not factored any meaningful growth in federally funded infrastructure programs, all told, we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and thereby enhance long-term value for our shareholders.","Thanks very much for you interest in Martin Marietta. The operator will now give the required instructions. We'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","Ward, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned atypical costs. Could you expand a little bit on what they were and discuss the impact it may have had on your margin?","C. Howard Nye","Absolutely, Arnie. Really, it may fall in several key buckets. I guess, number one, we can look at some money that we spent typically bringing the acquired businesses that I spoke to in Atlanta really up to the type of level that we would expect. We spent a little bit over $3 million doing that in that market. If we take a look at what happened in Denver, you heard me reference the historic flooding that occurred there. We spent around $800,000 in repairs and other things in Colorado","along the front range attributable to that single event, but I'll tell you perhaps even more notably is we think the profit impact for the quarter was probably $2 million down for us in Colorado, around $0.04 per share. So that's notable all by itself. And then lastly, and this one was odd for us, Arnie, we had about a $2.6 million debt on workers' compensation. As many of you have heard me say in the past, safety is the core function here in Martin Marietta and we've had 2 incidents earlier in the year that were serious that are atypical for us. And it's not the way that we do business, and it's not the way we like to go about doing the things that we do, because it affects people's lives. It also affects your bottom line and that had about a $2.6 million effect. If we go back to and really take those atypical items and then I try to outline, Arnie, what we would see is cost per ton would line up more with about 6.54 [ph] this quarter versus 6.56 [ph] in the prior quarter. So you can actually see, they had a rather profound effect on the cost to the quarter.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","And then my other question, if you will, on the asphalt tons to external customers, that was down 14% in the quarter. Is that more just driven by highway work or was there some other factor, weather or some other factor that may have caused that big a drop in asphalt tons?","C. Howard Nye","I think what you hit is the weather piece of it, Arnie. Remember, we picked up a much, much bigger piece of asphalt paving when we bought the assets in Colorado. If you go back to prior year, what you'll see is our asphalt tonnage was around 3.2 million tons, external was around 1.6 and internal around 1.5. So when we're watching asphalt tonnage go down, it's really the flooding that's in Colorado that hit that in the most profound way. So if I step back and simply measure it, what I can tell you is, on a year-to-date basis, 58% of our asphalt tonnage has been in Colorado. So when you've got that kind of a headline number in that market that has a 500-year event, it will certainly hit that percentage pretty hard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","First question is on pricing. Ward, you've offered a preliminary view for 2014 of volumes. Just wondering how you're beginning to think about the rate of pricing growth for next year?","C. Howard Nye","Garik, that's a fair question. Obviously, you've heard us say in the past how we feel like once we get some significant volume growth, pricing on a percentage basis, we believe, will start to follow that volume growth on a percentage basis as well. And I think that's very much what we've seen this year. What I like about what we've seen in this year, in particular, Garik, is we're looking at a very, very flat year. And the types of pricing that we thought we'd see, frankly with more volume, and I think we would've had it but for the Q2 weather effect has actually held up very nicely. And I think to underscore that, and I think this helps you build toward next year. You are looking at 2.6% pricing up in the quarter. But if you really go and take a look at the mix effect that we had, it really would have a great handle on it if it was more normalized, because what I will tell you is we saw some big jumps in the quarter in base and in sand and in screenings. And we actually saw some pretty notable drops in riprap. So in other words, we're selling more lower-priced products and less higher-priced products. Remember, too, that during the last call, I spoke to the fact that we had seen midyear price increases in around 11% of our markets versus really that 2% in the prior year. So when you take what I feel like has been the type of growth that we've seen this year and the mix effect that we've seen, I think when you come back and try to start modeling yourself on what that's going to look like next year, hopefully, that's giving you some direction. We'll obviously talk in much more detail about the pricing when we come out with the full year results in February. But I think that should give you at least an eye on it.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Just a follow-up on the mix effect. As you look out over the next, call it, 2 to 3 quarters, should we think that the mix effect that you saw in Q3 is going to continue, just given the timing and the size of the projects carrying a lower mix in backlog is going to persist?","C. Howard Nye","I think you might see some of that. But I think you might see some of that for good reasons, and here are the good reasons that I would go to, Garik, and that is, if I'm really looking at some of the major projects that we either have or that I think we're coming up. There is the moment [ph] . I'd really break it down into 2 different buckets, and I'll give you a drive across the geography, but I think this helps you get a mix piece of it. And right now, in Dallas, there's $5 billion of highway projects that we think will be there in 2014. That's up from $3 billion in 2013. To put things in perspective, the North Carolina's DOT budget is $3 billion. We're talking more than that just in DFW. I think when we go back to what we talked about in Colorado, I mean, the numbers that I'm saying coming out of Colorado are in excess of $400 million relative to just the work that has to be done to repair the flooding. That doesn't have anything to do with the RAMP program that's there as well. Even as we suddenly turn and come Eastern Mississippi and take a look at $1.2 billion of upgrades at the Orlando airport, or the I-4 project in Florida, all these will be starting, in many respects, with base and they're working their way up. Same issues with a $1.2 billion light-rail program in Charlotte, a lot of work at Douglas Airport. And then -- that's just in infrastructure. If we come across and look at what's going on in nonres, we're seeing considerable work in a number of geographies right now. What Boeing is doing in South Carolina is of major significance. Both MetLife and Citrix are coming here to the Triangle. What we've seen as far as data storage in Nebraska and Iowa has been absolutely amazing. I mean, big, big projects at Facebook, Google and Microsoft. And in Iowa, by itself, MidAmerican Energy's announced a $1.9 billion wind investment in that state. The reason that I go through that, Garik, because if you've got that degree of new projects starting, I think you can expect to see a higher degree of base going to a number of those. But the good news is, you're also going to see, during the fullness of those projects, clean products going through as well. So I think that's just important color for you to have as you think about the pricing trends and what the volume mix may be.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Just one final question on residential construction. Your volumes into the residential end market lagged the broader market in the third quarter. You're expecting double-digit growth into residential next year, which would imply that the gap between your shipments and broader housing starts would narrow. Is that a fair assumption? Should we think that the residential volumes for you in 2014 will look closer to what housing starts do next year?","C. Howard Nye","Garik, if you think back to it, I mean think of it in this terms. Residential housing segment for us at its low, let's call it 7-ish, 6%, 7%. Res for us at peak back in 2006 was around 21%. For the quarter, this quarter, res was around 13%. For the same quarter last year, res was around 8%. But here's what I think is happening, Garik, as we look at res. You've seen mostly a large explosion in multifamily residential over the last, let's call it, 18 months. You're seeing more and more single-family residential right now. You're seeing considerable lot absorption. And what's going to end up having, I believe, is you're going to see more and more single-family housing and you're going to see more subdivision development. Remember, part of what I discussed before, relative to housing is, we would end up being a laggard in housing this time because you have so many subdivisions that have the infrastructure built into them, that in the early phases of it, it would be about sticks and bricks. And what we have right now is western construction is not so much about sticks and bricks, but it's starting to be more about subdivisions. And now what we're starting to see, and I think certainly in the markets here in the East Coast anecdotally, you'd notice as well, it's becoming more mature and we are seeing subdivisions. So I would expect to see res go up, but what I would tell you, in normalized time, I wouldn't really expect residential to be much more than 14%, 15%, 16% of our volume anyway. So when we're getting in that 13% frame, that's not a bad place to be. But we will get the knock-on effect in nonres from it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So if I look at your guidance for the rest of this year, it looks like you brought the resi volumes -- that residential volume set is down a little bit. Did something shake out of the quarter there?","C. Howard Nye","Yes, I think we just brought it on a smidge. I think part of what we're trying to sort out, too, Todd, is really what can we expect in some of the markets that has had better residential activity. I mean think about Colorado right now. I mean, that's one of the markets on res that's doing considerably better than others. And I think part of what we're trying to sort in our minds is how long can we expect that season really to last in that type of market. So we're just trying to measure that out very carefully right now.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","In Atlanta where you guys picked up the quarry, I mean how is that market developing? Is it starting to pick up?","C. Howard Nye","No, it is starting to pick up. And we actually saw some decent volume growth there. Kind of the biggest single issue in a market like Atlanta is it fell so far. I mean, we're operating in the teens as far as recovery on volumes in that market right now. So it's just a very volume-challenged market. But we are seeing North Georgia getting considerably better. What I can tell you for example from the Lafarge quarries that we picked up during the quarter, we sold almost 380,000 tons of material from those quarries just in Q3. And what you will have noted in the comments that I had is I did refer to Atlanta as a rebounding market and I do think that's where it is. Again, we're seeing good -- a lot absorption there and we're seeing much better volumes. It's got a long way to go. But the nice thing about the Southeast right now is a little bit of volume in that market is really very, very powerful. And you can see that a little bit of volume, actually, from a changing gross margin added 200 basis points to that market right now. So yes, it's getting better and we think it will continue to get better. We don't think it's going to get explosively better, but we think it's on the right trajectory right now, Todd.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Switching to highway side. Your comments on TIFIA that only 2 projects have been approved from the, I guess the latest bill for '13 and '14, but you're looking for the volumes to pick up significantly in the back half of '14 and then even more in '15. What needs to happen between now and then for that outcome to occur?","C. Howard Nye","They need to start running projects, Todd. It's inconceivable in so many respects that we're sitting here today and 2 projects that've been led [ph] . And, by the way, they're both in Chicago. As we sit here and simply do our topside math, there are $46 billion worth of applications that are in right now, $46 billion. If we come back and take a look at the Martin Marietta markets, it's nearly $16 billion worth of work that we're going to have a very, very good and legitimate shot at right now. I guess my sense is we're probably going to see 2 or 3 more TIFIA projects, probably come out before the end of the year. But everything that we're hearing tends to indicate we're going to start seeing it come out in much more healthy chunks as we go into the New Year. But what has to happen, Todd, is they need to put some contracts out there and get it done. As I'm looking at the list that I have right now, I see there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 projects right now under review. And again, as we've said, only 2 of them had, had the credit agreements actually executed. And again, this is under the new TIFIA projects as you noted.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And final question, this is probably for Anne. Anne, looking at the SG&A in the Aggregates segment, I guess it's been running right at $28.4 million a quarter, really, all year. Is that a good run rate to think about?","Anne H. Lloyd","Yes, that's not an inappropriate run rate. Because most of the excess costs have been at the corporate level with whether it be our information systems project or other initiatives that we've been working on. So the aggregate SG&A should stay relatively constant.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Nothing seasonal in the fourth quarter there?","Anne H. Lloyd","There shouldn't be anything seasonal, not when it comes to that type of -- there are some per capita charges that go through there, but it's not materially consequential, Todd.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if we think about the $6 million-plus corporate line, is that coming in with the end of the IT project?","Anne H. Lloyd","That should come in as we move into 2014 with the end of the IT project as well as some other initiatives that we had going on this year.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So maybe kind of continue at that run rate in the fourth quarter and then start coming in first quarter?","Anne H. Lloyd","That's not an unreasonable assumption.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research.","Christopher White","This is Chris calling in for Kathryn today. Just one question. I wanted to follow-up a bit on Colorado if I could. Can you tell us what type of overlap Martin has in those areas that are expecting a lot of the rebuild due to the flooding?","C. Howard Nye","If you think about putting all the flooding lies, I mean it was truly in Denver Metro and principally north of there. I mean, some of the worst flooding was in Boulder. If you're at our single largest quarry in that market, specification aggregates, you are looking right into Boulder. So what I would tell you is we're in a very good place to be able to supply those projects. The other thing that I like about it, Chris, is we've got good, hard rock in that market. A lot of what's being fed in that market, the farther north you go are from Louisville deposits. And some of the Louisville deposits I think were probably hit pretty hard with that flooding. So I think it's twofold. Number one, I think we'll have a nice place to be very helpful and supply materials going forward. And I do think in many respects, there's going to be some depletion plays that will benefit us from Boulder.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just had kind of a big picture question. If I think about people investing in Aggregates stocks the last few years, really the biggest question seems to have been, besides pricing power, just when the volume is coming back. And so we're seeing a little bit signs of that and there's reasons to be a little more optimistic. My question was, outside of simply volume recovering to the industry, what kind of opportunities are you looking at or do you see or should we focus on for you to continue to drive value in the underlying business? I'm just trying to understand just beyond cyclicality what the opportunity is.","C. Howard Nye","I think it's 2 different opportunities. I think the opportunity number one is where you position your business relative to markets. You've heard me say in my prepared comments that our long-term aim is to have a #1 or #2 position in markets that we think have near-term and long-term economic attractiveness. So if we pause and reflect on what that means for us, as we look at the swap that we did last year, Denver, Colorado for the River business, we think from our business, that was really a very constructive thing for us to do. We think that added considerable shareholder value. I think you can and should expect us to continue to look for swaps and to engage in asset exchanges on a tax free basis. It's a very efficient back of transaction to improve our market position. So I think that's one thing you can expect. I think as we turn our attention here to the corporate office, as part of what Anne was saying in response to an earlier question, is we had made some investments here in different functions. Part of what we're talking about regularly is functional excellence in this organization, in the corporate office, throughout our business as well. And we think that we can continue to get better, faster, cheaper at everything that we do. Part of what we're sensitive to, pricing, to your point, Adam, has been a great story. But we're still selling the product for less than $11 a ton. And at the end of the day, when that's the world that you operate in, you better be good on cost, because if you aren't, you're going to be out of business. So improving our markets, moving our business the way that we need to and being focused on functional excellence in addition to the volumes are the types of things that I think you should headline for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just a few questions real quick. Ward, could you touch on the progress with midyear price increases that you had this year and how it compares to some of the traction you've gotten, say, like in last year, for example?","C. Howard Nye","Yes, absolutely. Trey, as you would recall, during the last teleconference, we spoke about the fact that we were seeing double-digit markets with midyear price increases on them. And we also said that as a practical matter, you're only going to capture a portion of that in the back half of the year because you're going to end up protecting customers on larger jobs on which you quoted them. So the midyear price increases that we discussed during the last conference call are in place, and they're going forward, as you would imagine. The primary thing that, that does, I believe, is it raises the bar on what your pricing can be going into the New Year. Obviously, we haven't given you any pricing guidance yet for '14, and we'll do that very, very early in '14. But the midyear price increases that we discussed were far more -- they're wider and more in dollars and cents than they were in the previous year, and we think that bodes well for next year in particular.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","How did that compare, Ward, to 2012? You said double-digit markets, what was that in '12?","C. Howard Nye","In '12, it's 2. If we go back and recall, we have gotten midyear price increases in San Antonio and we've gotten midyear prices in Houston, and that was really good. So you're talking double digits versus 2 markets last year. So it was a dramatic change year-over-year.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Anne, on oil and gas, I mean, obviously big for you guys this quarter. What percent of your overall shipments go into what you would consider oil and gas?","C. Howard Nye","Here's the way you can think of it, Trey. Last year, we sold a little bit over 6 million tons to these different shale plays, and we think it will be slightly up versus where it was last year. What's fascinating though is to watch the way the movement works between these different plays. What I would tell you, Eagle Ford for us is clearly the single largest one, and we're looking at tonnage there that's relatively flat. Now, when we were having this conversation at the beginning of the year, we thought it would be relatively flat in Eagle Ford. I think people were dismissive of that. But now as we've come back and taken a look, part of what I really like to see is the plays like Marcellus, they've gotten much better this year. We're seeing about 0.5 million tons up year-over-year into the Marcellus. And then we also have a new entry into the [indiscernible] play, which is more in Oklahoma, and we think we're going to pick up nearly 200,000 tons there. So year-over-year, last year, slightly over 6 million. This year, a smidge more than that. But keep in mind, the thing that we haven't really seen yet, we're about to see it, is going to be the follow-on effect of DOT linings to come back and start to cure these roads, particularly farm-to-market roads in South Texas that have been destroyed by this heavy traffic. I've seen some bidding activity literally just this week on that. So that's been a very quiet issue that's been out there, but we know it's been building, and I think that's something that you're likely to see the knock-on effect out as we go into 2014.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Ward, I know you don't have a crystal ball but you're pretty well plugged in, what's your best guess or gut on kind of what we could see coming out of Washington as we approach the expiration of the current highway bill? Do you think that there's a chance we could get another short-term build put in place? Do think we'll be in a similar situation where we'll see a series of CRs or where do you -- what's your best guess on how that could shake out?","C. Howard Nye","Trey, you're right. I mean, that's a crystal ball that I wish had because I could do something else, not that don't love this. Trey, I guess I think of this. I think there's more consensus around at this time than there was last time. Let's start with that notion. At the same time, for me to sit here and suggest to you that I think there's going to be a single [indiscernible] from MAP-21 to the next highway bill, I just don't think it's genuine, because I don't think Washington can do that, frankly. Do I think they'll go through 9 CRs like they did last time? No, I don't think they'll go through 9 CRs. But I think Barbara Boxer is taking a very constructive role in the Senate to try to push this along right now. At the same time, we've got new leadership in the House and I think Congressman Shuster is taking a very, very productive approach on that. I think the bipartisan spirit that we're starting to see around highway funding is a very different conversation than we were seeing 2 years ago. So my sense would be, Trey, do I think we'll have a CR or 2? Yes, I think we probably will. Do I think we'll have 9? No, I don't. Do I think we might see more than a 2-year bill? Yes, I think we probably will. So again, if that's worth what you're paying for right now, Trey, I guess that's probably where I would be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A couple of just housekeeping questions. You went through some of the transient items, $3 million in acquisition, $2.6 million on workers' comp, $800,000 on Denver. Can you just help us understand where those costs actually flowed through? Was the $3 million a P&L cost that flowed through Aggregates?","C. Howard Nye","It was the Aggregates line of product production costs.","Anne H. Lloyd","Yes. It's primarily a direct production cost. Almost all of it is costs, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And Denver would've been there, too, so you're looking like $3.8 million of add back?","Anne H. Lloyd","Correct.","C. Howard Nye","Yes.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And what about the workers' comp?","Anne H. Lloyd","Same thing.","C. Howard Nye","Same thing.","Anne H. Lloyd","All production costs.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And you called out some transient costs in Specialty Products. I think it was maintenance work on the kiln.","C. Howard Nye","Yes, that's exactly right. It's about $1 million, Ted. That's the quick way to think about that. We've taken a #4 kiln and #7 kiln and had some work also on #6 kiln all during the quarter and [indiscernible] spent about $1 million.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So when you add those back kind of incremental look like, what we would've expected and kind of what you've been putting up?","Anne H. Lloyd","Yes, and then you also look at coal. Coal is about $1.5 million. As we get that $2.5 million in the Specialty Products business, that's really completely reconciled prior third quarter to this third quarter.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, and I realize you're not giving the '14 guidance, but you're going to start getting decent volume absorption, knock on wood that we get this kind of like mid-single digit or better volume growth. Is there any reason to think we won't see the incrementals that you've historically talked about in Aggregates of being 50% to 60% in 2014?","C. Howard Nye","Ted, the biggest single driver that's going to be if we get the growth across the business. If we get it widespread across the business, I don't think there's any reason that you shouldn't expect to see that. Yet again, if the West continues to be disproportionately better than the East, it's more challenging, because the Eastern markets tend to be higher priced and more profitable. But if we really see these Eastern markets start to get some traction, and we are starting to see places like Charlotte get well and we're starting to see places like Atlanta get better, if we see that type of trajectory, I think what you're saying is right in the target zone.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then on your 2014 framework, I recognized you cited a couple of different sources for perspective. Where would you have the -- I guess where would you see the best upside risk or biggest concern? And where's your confidence greatest among those kind of 4 end markets that 2014 is going to look better than '13?","C. Howard Nye","As we come back, I think the places that I have the most resilience around, we've got a good looking backlog at least as a projects that I'm looking at are nonres in potential -- I mean, in particular. So I think we'll continue to see nonres grow and I think we'll see that growth across the United States. And again, I tend to believe, Ted, that on the housing piece of it, where we are again, primarily a Southeast and Southwest company, the type of housing growth that we're going to see particularly as we start making that transition from less multifamily to more single-family, I think those 2 places add up a pretty good punch. And again, when you come back with nonres at 30% of the business and you come back at res, let's call it 13%, 14% of the business. Again, I liked what I saw in trajectory in ChemRock and Rail. I was seeing balance volumes going up with BN [ph] , with UP and with Kansas City Southern. And with the type of footprint we have there, suddenly, we're well over half of our volumes right there in those 3. And I have a -- and I feel pretty good about that, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And the last thing I'll ask, I promise. When we look forward to SG&A, I mean you mentioned about IT upgrades over in October. If you can help us understand what that kind of year-over-year benefit looks like next year? And then when we just think about headwinds and tailwinds, I'm guessing the pension expense should be down next year, we're kind of estimating $5 million to $10 million tailwind for you.","C. Howard Nye","Here's the way to think of it, Ted. I mean we've really been spending about $1 million a quarter on the information system. Really, if we come back and look at Q3, it's probably about $1.5 million, and we're bringing in for landing here so as we ramp that up. The pension expense, if you got a good sense of what discount rates will be at year end, that's going to be really your driver on what that's going to look like. And again, as we look at this year, we had $1.5 million for the quarter professional expenses tied back to that notion of functional excellence. And those are all costs that I wouldn't think would be repeating into next year. And the fact is, we anticipate getting benefit from those investments next year.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I recognize that none of us are, like you, have bought a crystal ball that I can forecast interest rates. I wouldn't be on this call with you. But would you expect that should be a tailwind sort of something dramatic happening in the next 7 weeks?","Anne H. Lloyd","Absolutely, you would. I mean, particularly at a minimum, the IF [ph] call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ward, can you just talk about besides energy, which verticals, if you have the visibility, which verticals are driving the strength in your backlog for private nonres? And can you just talk about is it early-stage project work that you're seeing? Just so we can use what you're seeing us a way to read across through other industrial markets with nonres exposure.","C. Howard Nye","Jerry, I think that's exactly what it is. I do think it's early on, on that end and I think going back to that mix conversation that I was having early on the call, if part of what I think, when I'm seeing sand volumes up, let me give you a sense of it, Jerry. Sand volumes were up almost 630,000 tons in the quarter. That's a big number. What that tells me were a lot of [ph] ready mixed going out the door in some respects. And again, that's going to all be structural type of work, and I think it's disproportionate on that, if that's going to be into nonres projects right now. So when we're seeing let's start thinking about markets like Denver, start thinking about markets like Des Moines, start thinking about markets like Houston and San Antonio and even back in places like Dallas. And again, what we're seeing in markets today like Charlotte or even heading down into Charleston, South Carolina is a very, very different field as you and I would have been having at the same time a year ago. So I think your notion around commercial and product mix and ready mix in those markets, and either us supplying ready mix to some of them or the products to ready mixed players is a good way to think about it.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And your downstream business, can you just talk about at which point do you expect to see pricing power, especially in concrete ahead of material inflation? Do you think you might get to that next year, once the cement capacity for some of your suppliers and competitors becomes fully utilized? Is that the tipping point that you're looking for to get better gross margin expansion for your downstream businesses?","C. Howard Nye","The short answer is absolutely, Jerry. What's remarkable about the concrete business, if I look at the 2 principal geographies, which we're in the concrete business, here's a pretty big austerity in average for selling price between one and the other. And the ones that really has the higher selling price, we also have the ability to do more with pricing in the period. And I think you'll continue to see that market get much better. Remember in my prepared remarks, I talked about ready mix pricing being up 7.1%. And my sense has always been that's the single weakest link in the heavy building materials side, and when you're starting to see that type of pricing growth in ready mix, I think that's a very, very good sign for the balance of the industry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in terms of the overall volumes, obviously, nice performance in the third quarter. I think your guidance implies more muted year-on-year performance in the fourth quarter. Is that just a function of comps or any moving pieces for us to think about in the fourth quarter? Any residual impacts from the government concerns or anything like that?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, it's really more looking at something that we just had to say may feel normal like in weather. What I remember last year in particular, our team in Colorado was doing some downstream work into December. And that's a great result and that's great for them and maybe they do that again this year, but my guess is, it's a rare year where you're paving in December in places like Colorado. I was there yesterday in the morning, it was 20-some degrees. So if it's a normal weather, I think that's at least how we're having to plan for it right now. And we're going to pray for better.","Operator","I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call over back to Ward Nye for any further remarks.","C.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","By any measure, this was an outstanding quarter for us. We recorded record net sales, gross profit, and net earnings. Our performance in the third quarter reflects some basic realities about today's Martin Marietta, namely the growing demand for construction materials, coupled with our operational excellence and synergy realization, has enabled us to generate net sales that exceeded $1 billion, a milestone for us, as well as achieve our stated incremental margin objective by delivering $0.77 of gross profit on each incremental dollar of net sales over the prior-year quarter. Further to that point, we believe that we're in the beginning stages of a construction-centric recovery that's taking place in our country and, most importantly for us, in those markets we serve. As a result, we see further opportunities to increase our sales, profits, and cash flow in the coming months and even years.","The past quarter also saw us complete the sale of our California cement operations in a cash transaction for $420 million. In anticipation of the proceeds from the sale, we repurchased $158 million of our common stock during the third quarter, giving us the opportunity to further enhance shareholder value. We anticipate returning the remaining net proceeds to shareholders with additional stock repurchases throughout the remainder of the year.","Before we discuss third quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe this provides meaningful data to better analyze our third quarter performance. Let me briefly summarize the supplemental information. Slide 2 provides comparative net sales and gross profit, which helps illustrate our profit trajectory. Slides 3 and 4 provide product line volume and pricing metrics. We're pleased to report solid growth in each product line. Finally, slide 5 provides a roll-forward of our earnings from operations.","Now let's delve into some of the underlying details that support these metrics. Aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end use market account for approximately 43% of total volumes and increased more than 5% compared with the prior-year quarter. We're encouraged to see states take increased responsibility for funding infrastructure investment. In fact, highway awards for the trailing 12 months through July were at their high levels since 2000, with major project activity continuing to accelerate in the Southeastern United States and Texas. Additionally, today, voters in Texas are expected to pass Proposition 7, a ballot initiative that would dedicate an additional $2.5 billion annually for non-toll road projects beginning in 2017.","Last week, federal highway funding was extended to November 20, with the passage of the 35th short-term patch since 2008. The roughly three-week duration of this continuing resolution increases our optimism regarding the passage of a multiyear federal highway bill this year, a move that has bipartisan support in Congress and which the President has indicated his willingness to sign. To that effect on October 18, Congressman Bill Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, introduced the $325 billion Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act. This means that, together with the Senate's previously announced Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy Act, or DRIVE, for the first time in over a decade, both chambers of Congress are readying to advance multiyear federal highway bills. Should a federal highway bill be passed before the end of the year, any meaningful impact on our business would not be expected prior to the second half of 2016, but clearly its positive impact will be felt for several years thereafter.","The nonresidential end use market is comprised of two components: light construction and heavy construction. The light nonresidential construction component is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. Consistent with these drivers, light nonresidential aggregates volume increased 29%. Importantly, each reportable group achieved double-digit growth in this component of construction, with the largest percentage increase being reported in the Southeast division. Light nonresidential shipments are benefiting from low energy prices and years of steady employment growth. In fact, non-farm employment in the United States is currently about 4 million jobs above the pre-recession peak.","The heavy nonresidential construction component is primarily industrial building, as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 21% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and declined 9% compared with the third quarter of 2014. As expected, shale energy-related volumes were down versus the prior-year quarter. However, we expect large energy-related industrial and infrastructure projects during the remainder of the year and early 2016 to offset the decline in direct shale exploration activity. Despite the reduction in shale-related shipments, domestic crude oil production is projected to reach 9.25 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of more than 500,000 barrels per day over 2014 levels, all evidence of continuing energy sector transformation in the United States.","Nonresidential construction activity continues to vary by location. Texas again led the nation, with more than $24 billion of starts for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015. Significant growth is also being experienced in key Southeastern states, including Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Our leading positions in these markets should allow us to capitalize on these opportunities.","The residential end use market represented 18% of our aggregate shipments and increased 15% compared with the prior-year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be in line with the trend in housing starts. Texas leads the nation in single-family unit starts, while Florida, Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina, and South Carolina each rank in the top 10 in growth for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015.","Finally, to conclude the discussion of end use markets for the third quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our third quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were up 7%, attributable to increased railroad ballast shipments, which in part are driven by deferred maintenance from prior years, when rail congestion and weather hindered such activity.","Aggregates products line pricing increased in all reportable groups, led by the West Group, consistent with our stated expectations. Overall, we achieved a 5% increase. Aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped was down slightly, with lower energy prices benefiting the cost structure. On average, we paid $2.04 per gallon compared with $3.09 in the prior-year quarter, contributing to an $11 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the entire company. During the first nine months of the year, we have recognized a total of $16 million in diesel fuel savings despite a 22% increase in consumption, driven by economic growth and in the TXI acquisition.","The aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by almost $13 million. Notably, the heritage ready-mix concrete product line reported a 19% increase in volume and a 9% increase in average selling price. Gross profit for the Aggregates business increased $60 million and resulted in a gross margin increase of 500 basis points over the prior-year quarter to 25.3% of net sales. In fact, we're very pleased to note that all of our reportable business segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by a 780-basis-point increase in the Southeast Group.","Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. We expect further recovery to provide opportunities to expand profitability towards historical levels for the Southeast Group. Overall, our Aggregates business exceeded our publicly stated target and generated an incremental gross margin of 68%.","The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $57 million and a gross margin of 34%. For the quarter, the business's earnings from operations were $17 million, a slight decline compared with the prior year. Net sales and earnings were negatively affected by a decline in domestic steel production.","Our third quarter Cement business results are impressive. Gross profit increased $14 million, as a 16% increase in average selling price to nearly $100 per ton and synergy realization more than offset volume declines. Gross margin expanded 1,250 basis points to 34.5%. For the quarter, the business incurred almost $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs which, as expected, will likely double in the fourth quarter. For the third quarter, the Cement business shipped 1.1 million tons to external customers. Over 70% or 138,000 tons of the decline in cement shipments during the quarter resulted from the sale of the California cement business.","Upon announcement of the sale of that business, as expected, certain customers realigned their volumes to other suppliers. Excluding the California sale impact, cement shipments declined 4%, with half resulting from a loss of direct shipments to the energy sector and the other half from the well-publicized introduction of new cement capacity in Texas. We remain diligent in achieving margin growth through a disciplined price structure. The aim is, as ever, to increase profitability and shareholder value.","The Portland Cement Association, or PCA, forecasts a favorable supply\/demand imbalance in Texas over the next several years, with continuing growth on an annual basis through 2019. We believe this forecast supports continued resilient growth.","In that regard, it's important to recognize and understand the diversity of the Texas economy. Today's Texas is not the Texas of the early 1980s. In the 1980s, the Texas construction sector was overbuilt. On average from 1982 to 1984, when there were nearly 11 million fewer people living in Texas, annual housing permits were approximately 75,000 higher than during 2012 to 2014.","Importantly, too, over the last decade, Texas has led the United States in terms of job growth, creating 30% of new jobs across the country. This has led to near-continuous positive net migration to the state, a trend that's expected to continue. In addition to increased housing demands in the state, infrastructure spending, which represents our most aggregates-intensive end use, is also crucial to continued growth. The strong Texas Department of Transportation budget, coupled with the expected Proposition 7 annual contribution to state transportation initiatives, should continue to provide a solid foundation for construction materials demand and extend the growth trajectory in Texas.","Moving back to our quarterly results, consolidated selling, general, and administrative, or SG&A, expenses were 5.5% of net sales. The increase of 20 basis points compared with the prior-year quarter reflects the impact of higher pension expense. For the quarter, we incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate.","In connection with the California cement business divestiture, we recorded a loss on the sale of $25 million and also incurred nearly $4 million of related expenses. Excluding the nonrecurring loss and related charges, our adjusted earnings from operations for the quarter were $208 million, an improvement of 36% over the prior-year quarter's adjusted earnings from operations of $153 million. For the first nine months of the year, we generated $320 million of operating cash flow, compared with the $202 million in 2014. The 58% increase is due to higher earnings, partially offset by working capital needs in 2015. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment, including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project which we believe will be complete on time by year-end.","On year-to-date basis, we've returned $339 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 1.6 million shares of our common stock, together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares in total. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 2015 was 2.2 times, in compliance with our leveraged covenant and within our targeted range.","As we look ahead to completing a successful year, we expect consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, or EBITDA, to range from $800 million to $820 million, exclusive of the one-time loss on the sale of the California cement business. The range also assumes we do not experience an early onset of winter weather in our key markets, thereby ending the construction season prematurely. This represents the most significant risk for our fourth quarter performance. As you're likely aware, recent weather events in South Carolina and Texas have affected activity. At this time, we do not expect a material impact on fourth quarter results. However, operational inefficiencies, if not offset by demand, could affect results.","We have also started to frame our preliminary end use outlook for 2016, based on our internal observations and external data published by Dodge Data & Analytics and The Portland Cement Association. We currently expect modest growth in the infrastructure and nonresidential markets and double-digit growth in the residential market. ChemRock\/Rail shipments are expected to be relatively flat. Cement demand in Texas is expected to increase 4% over 2015 levels. Our forecast does not reflect any major benefit that would come from the passage of a multiyear federal highway bill, as there will be a long lag time \u2013 or a lag time \u2013 before a bill provides meaningful impact to our business. Thus, the positive impact would occur beyond 2016.","To conclude, we continue to be excited about the future of Martin Marietta. We believe we're at the beginning stage of a construction-centric recovery in many of our key markets, and we're extremely advantageously positioned to benefit from the expected upturn. Additionally, our third quarter results illustrate our growth trajectory when price, volume, and costs are all favorable. We're focused on the execution of our strategic plan while remaining committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. These pillars should lead to increased shareholder value.","If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to answering your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thank you for taking my questions today. I guess, first wanted to focus on your outlook by end market in 2016. And that outlook is a little bit more muted, I think, than we and others had expected. How should we think about margins, in particular incremental gross margins, on a go-forward basis, given the strong incrementals you reported in the quarter and against the backdrop of maybe a little bit more muted end market growth in 2016? Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Kathryn. Let's talk about it in two different ways. Let's talk about the outlook; then let's talk about really what margins are going to look like, because we're all talking about growth. We're is talking about how much growth there's going to be. Because as I'm sitting here looking at what I think next year looks like, I think it's some of the best outlook we've seen in years. We have broad-based state DOT initiatives that are in place. We have residential reacceleration under way. We see good private sector, nonresidential work. There're some huge non-building projects, and what I think will be continued great pricing dynamics.","But here's the way that I would encourage you to think about margin, Kathryn. Here's a great way, I think, to think of it. If we look at the margins that we kicked out in our business \u2013 incremental 77% across the business; you see what we did on the Aggregate space all by itself \u2013 here's a way to think of it. For the quarter \u2013 I'm looking at heritage tonnage right now. For the quarter, our heritage aggregates tonnage was 42.8 million. Last year, for the similar quarter, 40.6 million. So a couple million tons. Let's look at it through nine months. 106.5 million versus 104.3 million. Any way you look at it, it's about 2 million tons. Let's put that in context, and I think it helps with the margin. 2 million tons is about the size of what I would think is a really good quarry. One quarry.","Here's the difference. That profit increased for the quarter \u2013 from those 2 million tons \u2013 for the quarter was $30 million. The profit increase through the nine months for those 2 million tons was $85 million. Remember what my comments were at the end of the commentary: When you have volume, price, and cost all working in the right direction, it's very powerful. Part of what we said on the incremental margins is when we get to the point that we've recovered half of the volume that we lost in the downturn \u2013 and remember, that was 80 million tons \u2013 we thought we'd see on average 60% incrementals in the business, and clearly what we're seeing right now on the rolled-up business is far better than that.","If we're back to the notion of being at the beginning innings of a construction-centric recovery, and you're seeing that type of profitability over that small amount of tonnage \u2013 and keep in mind what this means, Kathryn. This is not with our most profitable business well yet. This is with our most profitable business starting to get well in Georgia and Florida and North Carolina. So if we see the type of acceleration in those markets that I hope we'll see, then the types of margins that you've seen in this quarter and otherwise I believe will continue to replicate themselves, and we're more than comfortable with that 60% margin that we put out there. That's a long answer, but your question's a good one. I wanted to be thorough with the response.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","That's helpful. Toward the end, you were just \u2013 I wanted to tag onto that regional focus. What are you seeing in terms of demand, either on a state-by-state or, broadly speaking, region-by-region basis? And if there are any differences in \u2013 maybe you could focus a little bit more on the nonres end market and bifurcate between what's really more heavy industrial versus just traditional light commercial. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kathryn. Let me approach it this way. Let's look at each side of the Mississippi River for a second and just think through. And let's start in Colorado, which has been a great and important state to us for the last several years. I really look at Colorado as a front-running state right now with a lot of room ahead of it. The employment picture in Colorado is very good. Denver's ranked 23rd nationally. There's a private sector that's really very strong. It's ranked 11th in housing starts. Their DOT program remains remarkably attractive. That's up 9% for the trailing 12 months. And, again, what we're seeing there in downstream pricing continues to be very good. I think what our team in that marketplace has done with the ready mixed business is really impressive.","If we come farther south and take a look at what's going on in Texas, remember, it's third in employment. It's up almost 900,000 jobs over the last 36 months. We've got I-35 in North Texas, going \u2013 DFW and \u2013 Dallas and Fort Worth, and obviously, the Grand Parkway in Houston. And then we've got what we believe is going to be the coming of the $2.5 billion really hitting in 2017 coming from Proposition 7.","Another state or two to think about, as long as we're still west of the Mississippi, are both Iowa and Nebraska. And Iowa has been a remarkably consistent performer for us. But here's the pop we're going to see in Iowa: We're seeing higher gas taxes there. We're going to see DOT dollars up 30%, and we see a farm economy there this year that, while some portions of the farm economy in fairness are down, we are seeing tremendous yields in the farm economy. So when we come back and look at tremendous yields on what that could mean into Q4 or Q1, again, weather dependent, very good ag lime circumstances.","If we transition across the Mississippi River \u2013 let's talk about Florida for a second. Very \u2013 very positive, all segments are up, number two in job growth, very strong DOT program, number one in residential, and number four in nonres, which I know you asked me about. We'll hit more about that in just a second. The state of Georgia, I believe, finally, finally is starting to hit its stride. It's lagged Florida just a bit, but right now, it's number nine in job growth. It's number three in residential. We're seeing a double of the DOT in that state, and we're going to start to feel that impact really even more profoundly late in 2016, and the TSPLOST program in South Georgia puts some much-needed volume in that part of the state.","And then lastly, but certainly not least, is what we're seeing here in our home state of North Carolina. What I would tell you is that state's really up and coming right now, number five in employment. It's just passed Georgia, in fact. It's number eight in single-family. And what we're looking at right now on a trailing 12 months, at least through August, is we're seeing DOT awards up almost 47%, and we're seeing good work come up on the HOT lanes in Charlotte right now. So, if we look at those six states that are disproportionately important to us right now, I think that gives you a pretty good sense of where it is.","Now, the other part of your question, Kathryn, that I want to try to answer is really what's going on with nonres, because, again, if we're giving the sense that nonres is still, that's not a sense that we're trying to give. Nonres, particularly on the heavy side \u2013 and I think that's where your question was \u2013 tend to be good, long-term, multiyear jobs. So think of it in these terms, that we're looking at nonres construction, again, on a trailing 12-month-basis, Florida is up 40%, North Carolina is up 18%, South Carolina is up 31%, and Colorado, which began its recovery well ahead of others, is up 7%.","At the same time, if we look at some of those states and same percentage over a three-year period \u2013 and again I say that because they're multiyear \u2013 Florida up 54%, North Carolina up 11%, Georgia up 24%, and Texas up 85%. So, again, if we're looking at heavy construction with years of tail to it, I think it's got a pretty good story. And then obviously the story of the quarter relative to the light side of it, that tends to follow housing, was really a very attractive quarter. And again in the states that we believe are disproportionately important to us, we think will continue to be a good story.","Did I hit what you needed on that?","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Yep, you did. Thank you very much for answering my questions today. I'll hop back in the queue.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks. Afternoon, Ward and Anne.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Todd.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Todd.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT","I want to circle back on that last question and that last answer, Ward, because I hear you on the amount of work that there is on the heavy side. This is specifically with regard to nonres ...","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT","...and on the fact that you're seeing the lighter nonres kind of follow through and certainly a good performance in 3Q. But, I mean, that is where you trimmed the guidance for the year, and the preliminary outlook for next year has kind of a slower pace of growth implied than what you've seen this year in nonres, going from sort of \u2013 we were at high single digits, now we're at low to mid single digits. I can't remember exactly. And then you're talking about sort of slight growth next year. So what's the disconnect? I mean, why are we seeing a deceleration there?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think you're just talking about what we're looking at relative to new projects. If you're looking at what's there and the volumes that we're likely to see on existing projects, again, that are multiyear, Todd, I think you're going to see a host of very strong multiyear projects that are already on the books. So really what I would tell you is this: are we seeing a bit of a slowing in the trajectory of some of the growth in Texas? I think the answer is yes. But if you're looking at the numbers and the way growth has been in that state over the last several years, it's been so heady that it almost has to naturally pull back while it's still growing.","Now, here's where I think the wildcard is. If you want to tell me or others want to say, you know what, I think it's getting better in North Carolina and Georgia and Florida and South Carolina more quickly than you're saying, I'll take that, because I think there's going to be nice growth in those states as well. But, again, if you start seeing a higher rate of growth in heavy nonres in the Eastern United States, that's really going to be the swing factor in some of this. Because I think when we go to Texas and simply look at what's going on there, or Colorado or Iowa or others, it's going to continue to be very healthy. We're simply talking about rates of growth, and we're already seeing volumes in some of those states that are at very, very good levels.","So if you're doing a compare across our geography and trying to sort out where is there, candidly, continued room for growth, it's in the East much more so than it is in the West. And the East has been a slower, steady growth pattern, really for the last two years, and you can see what the result is on the bottom line this year.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT","Well, that's \u2013 so thanks for that, and that is very interesting and leads us in interesting places. So if you're saying that you're going to basically see a handoff from growth in the West toward growth in the East, remind me, your margins and your average prices on aggregates are much higher in the East in general than they are in the West. Is that still true?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","That would still be true.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT","So that, going back to Kathryn's original question, would imply a bit of a, all else equal, a bit of a tailwind on price and margin and things like that next year, if in fact that's happening.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Todd, I think that's true. I mean, the pricing in the East has always been higher than it's been in the West. And, look, do we want to see as much volume go as possible? We absolutely do. The primary thing we really want to do is make sure that we continue to make more money and deliver more value for our shareholders. And what I would suggest to you, I think the results from the quarter are spectacular.","I think what we're having this year is an outstanding year. I think we're going to have a better year next year, and I think the parts of the country, to your point, that have historically been our most profitable parts of the country are continuing to get better. And I think the level at which they're getting better is starting to outpace other parts of the country. And by the way, they're overdue. That's not a surprise.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT","Excellent. Thanks for that. Second question, we've heard some other companies and private companies \u2013 I've asked this question a couple times today \u2013 talk about bottlenecks in parts of their business from labor generally at their customers, whether it's concrete finishing crews or framing crews or what have you. Is that something that you are seeing in your business?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, Todd, it absolutely, positively is. And probably the parts of the country where you have less labor issues than others might be in parts of South Texas, where you have some of the people who are directly involved in energy not necessarily directly involved in some of that work. But if we're in Colorado, it's tight. If we're in Iowa, it's tight. If we're here in the Carolinas and Georgia and South Carolina and increasingly in Florida, it's tight. And that's one of the reasons that when we were talking about how much volume we could recover in half 2 relative to those torrential rains that occurred in half 1 in the United States or in Texas, in particular, we had some concerns about that.","It's still a concern in markets like DFW and North Texas, in particular. Because, again, that economy, we talked about the fact that's the best single-family housing market in the United States. So you can imagine the type of activity that can be there. So the supply chain, the ability to deliver, et cetera, is challenged in those marketplaces. No question, Todd.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, Todd, I think if there was one uniform message that \u2013 as you know, our planning process has us travel around country. The one uniform message that we had, really, from almost every part of the geographies, was dealing with labor, and that impact on the supply chain.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT","And just to be clear, Anne, labor at your operations or labor at your customers?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Customers.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Customers. Downstream, Todd.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee CRT","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. First question is on aggregates pricing. You reiterated your guidance, but we are seeing some, I guess, deceleration in the reported growth in heritage aggregates pricing. Given the context of your volume outlook for 2016, I'm just wondering how maybe we should start thinking about the rate of price growth as we look out to next year.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Garik. We've actually always been pretty consistent on that, and that is, in a circumstance where you believe you have more muted growth than others, meaning really sub-5%, then pricing as a percent and volume as a percent have \u2013 end up being relatively tied to each other, particularly as you go up the ladder right now. So what I would say is, if I'm looking at pricing across our group right now, you saw the up 5%, at the same time, if I'm looking at it on a group-by-group basis, not surprisingly, we're seeing bigger price increases on a percentage basis in the Western United States, in large part because there's room for that in the West because it's been lower. But what I would suggest, Garik, is the view that we've shared really for the last couple of years on pricing has not materially changed.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. I guess just shifting to cement, couple pricing questions. You indicated that fourth quarter should be likely the last quarter that you'll see some of the low-priced TXI projects come through. And as then they roll off, you should benefit from higher pricing. Just wondering if you can maybe provide some sequential guidance on cement pricing, how we should think about those low-priced projects rolling off? And then secondly, you indicated some supply that has come onto the market in Texas. You also indicated 4% expected volume growth next year -","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","\u2013 and there's an announced price increase in the market for the spring. As you look out, clearly a couple months away, from the price increase being implemented next year, can you talk about some of the puts and takes around supply-demand in Texas and your level of confidence of securing pricing next year, given some of the supply-demand balancing?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure, we'll try to do that. I mean, here's the way that I would think about it, first of all. Let's talk about some of the dynamic that simply occurs because we're not going to be in cement in California anymore. So let's start with that and talk about the picture that you saw for the quarter, because I think that's important to really understand and have context around.","So 70% of the volume decline for the quarter was attributable to Riverside in California. So what you had immediately is when the deal's announced, you had certain customers who were seeing a change in that marketplace, who were seeing a non-vertically integrated player, ourselves, going away, and the downstream customers realigning themselves. So that was what we really saw in the quarter. If we back away from that, really, you're looking at cement volumes down 4%. Our quick snapshot is of the 4%, about 2% of that is cement that's no longer finding its way to oil or the oil patch or others, trying to find a home for some of that. And the other, I think, is directly to your point, Garik, and that is you do have a new importer right now in South Texas, and there has been some share that's gone there.","What I think we're focused on is value right now. To your point, we're looking at a $12-a-ton price increase in April. We are the market leader in Texas, and we have a lot of conviction around that. As I look at what Texas capacity is and look at what Texas demand is, both in 2016 and 2017, I'm seeing something in 2016 that's going to be close to 2.8 million tons of deficit. I'm seeing what people are projecting to be about a 3.2 million ton deficit as we go into 2017. So, as we're sitting here with what I feel like are very attractive and efficient plants, both in North Texas and Central Texas, I mean, here's what I'll tell you. What we have done relative to the efficiencies at Midlothian and Hunter during the time that we've been there, I think, is impressive. We can run plants in Texas as efficiently as anybody. If we want to go and get share, we can go and get share. That's not how I think we're going to put value for our shareholders today, and we're resilient on making sure that we're getting the price in that marketplace. I'm confident that we can.","And the fact is, at certain levels, and I think this is where we are, price is more valuable than volume. So if you come back and take a look at what our performance was in the quarter, remember what I said in my comments. Our cement results were impressive, and we believe that. And I believe we've got a very good team. I think we've got superb locations. I think we've got great operations. And I think given the dynamic in that marketplace, I feel pretty good about it, if you can't tell.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you. Just building on the last discussion on Texas and cement, could we talk about aggregates in Texas? What kind of volume pricing did upi see in the quarter?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, if we're just looking at \u2013 we'll talk about the West Group for a second, because what we're really seeing if we look at the West Group is we saw tonnage \u2013 15 million tons versus 14 million in the prior year. One thing to remember is North Troy tonnage is in there for last year, so that's going to throw that off pretty markedly.","Frankly, if we look at what we see in Texas for next year, I think that's probably what you're pretty interested in, too. And I got to tell you I feel pretty good about it. I mean, if we break it down and look at it this way, Keith, I mean, North Texas, I think the market there next year is better than it is this year, in large part driven by very large projects. The Horseshoe Project in downtown Dallas, as well as I-35 E and W are both going to be under way in North Texas, in the metroplex. State Highway 183 is very much under way. Even when we move farther south to Houston, part of what I look at is not just what we have awarded \u2013 and by the way, that's I-69 and Farm Market Roads 1488 and 1774, and some of the work that we have at Freeport LNG, but really what's coming \u2013 and I'm seeing good work relative to the Harris County Tollway Authority, good TxDOT work, good work also at Bush Airport. And then when we come down to South Texas, and we're looking at the large energy and infrastructure projects that really, in my view, support a good business in 2016 and beyond at Chenier at the pipe plants, Harbor Bridge, and otherwise, the volume that I think we're going to see in Texas on these long-lived projects is really attractive.","The other thing that I'm moved by in Texas right now is TxDOT already has a big budget, but if you spoke to the people at TxDOT, what they would tell you is it looks good, backlogs are good, going forward with work it looks attractive. And by the way, when we start putting this Prop 7 money to it, it's going to feel like it's some degree of steroids. So, again, you're talking big numbers in a state that already has big numbers, but what it gives me a sense of, Keith, is it's likely to be healthy there for a good while going forward.","Did you need more? I'm happy to talk more about Texas, I want to make sure I'm answering you.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Well, it's a lot of information, and without context it doesn't mean a lot. Basically my question was you saw cement volume down, effectively 4% that you were saying earlier in the call. I assume aggregates would go along with that. Was that the case in the -","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, that was not the case. So if I'm looking across our Southwest division, I'm seeing aggregate volumes up in almost every district that I'm seeing, and many of them at or close to double digits. And I'm seeing price up without exception in every district, just to be granular on that.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And the second quarter, we had the torrential rains there. And of course it got better here in the third. Looks like we had, I guess, a little pickup in aggregates there, not in cement. What's the deviation there?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I just think you've got some of the supply chain issues with ready mix and otherwise that we were actually talking to previously on the call with Todd. Actually I think in North Texas it was pretty good. I think the issue that we discussed is really some of the import and other issues more focused on Houston right now. And as I said, did we give up a little bit of share in that part of Texas? Absolutely we did. Do I regret it? No, I don't. Do I think price is more valuable? I do.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, Keith, if you think about it, Keith, there is still overhang from weather in the second quarter. You'll recall we talked about the fact that the clinker barns are full, the silos are full. So you have that, coupled with some new capacity, particularly coming into that South Texas area. That, to us, is really some of the dislocation during that period.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And \u2013 thank you for that. I guess final question. It was talked about in the initial question on the call, the delta between your commentary on nonresidential and the growth \u2013 the forecast in the press release of low single digits or modest growth, whatever you want to call it.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","I guess Texas trajectory, is that the difference there versus what I think many would've expected you to say about nonresidential, or were there other -","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah, I think it probably is. I think when you go back \u2013 and I think it's trajectory and multiyear nature of it. I think that's probably what people are reading or not reading into it, because if the sense is that we feel like nonres is going off a cliff in Texas, that's not what we're seeing. I think it's the bigger issue is what kind of pop are you going to see east of the Mississippi? I think there's going to be one. I think the question is we're going to quibble over how much and when, and at some point we'll all look at it in our rearview mirrors and be right.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Ward, just as a point of clarity, you framed your outlook for 2016. You mentioned that it was done in conjunction with McGraw-Hill's forecasts, and I very much interpret it to be Martin's outlook for those end markets. But obviously McGraw-Hill kind of models stuff nationally.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Is there a very specific Martin overlay so that those are very specific to your markets? And really the gist of the question is, is there potential for you to outgrow the markets, or should we very much interpret those as your volume guidance at this point in time?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Again, this is very, very preliminary guidance, Ted. So we'll obviously come back in February and give you what we feel like is a much more detailed snapshot of it. I mean, what we do as we go through a budgeting process is we're going to use basically Dodge and we're going to use PCA as markers that we'll have, and then we'll come back and say, let's talk about what form of deviation we may or may not see from that in any given market. Because if you've got a lot of bridge work in a market, that from a dollar perspective could pop a market pretty considerably. So we use those as markers and then we use what we're seeing in the field as something to really adjust and tune that a little bit with. Does that help?","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yeah. That's very helpful. On the Texas cement topic, I know you talked about the markets running in deficit of about 3 million tons in 2016 and 2017 -","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","\u2013 based off the most current analysis. I guess, what's the clearing mechanism for the market? I mean, is this a scenario where new imports find themselves into Texas to kind of clear the market? Is it demand destruction because pricing goes up? I mean, just \u2013 I think \u2013 we've gotten a lot of question on, I think, people's concerns that there will be more imports into Texas. So it'd be helpful just to get your guys' kind of perspective on that issue, and if you think that's a likely source of incremental supply.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I guess, my sense is \u2013 obviously Argos is coming into South Texas right now with probably \u2013 let's call it a half a million tons of cement. I do think that's a tough move for a lot of people to make simply because of logistics. Clearly, that's not something that's going to have any significant impact, for example, on a Dallas-Fort Worth type market.","I think you need to remember, too, that the vast majority of players who are in that market are also domestic producers. So the short answer is unless some cement comes in, you simply can't meet the market demand. That said, I think the plants that are in that state are good, efficient plants. I think in large part the need for much advanced imports in that state will not be particularly acute. I'd be surprised if we saw that. So I don't see a marked change coming in that marketplace, Ted, at least from a logistics and a practical perspective.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thanks. And then the last question's for Anne. Anne, slide 5 of your deck, you outline a $10 million headwind from net cost increases. You talked about energy being an $11 million tailwind in the quarter, I think. Can you just bridge us on the key components of that cost increase, just so we appreciate what they are?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, Ted. You're looking at some increased repair and maintenance costs, some increased overtime costs of your employees as you ramp that up versus adding a lot of new heads. Those are probably the two principal drivers.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So net think about those being about $20 million of headwind, offset by roughly $10 million of diesel benefit?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Round numbers, yeah.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. All right. Super. I'll leave it there. I know there are other people in the queue. Good luck this quarter, guys.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","So, a quick \u2013 I guess this would be a follow-up to Ted's question. As we look into next year, can you talk about \u2013 Anne, can you talk about some cost headwinds or tailwinds that you may be facing, outside of diesel, looking into 2016? So any other raw materials or SG&A or pension or just anything that we could kind of be aware of and watch as we enter next year?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think we'll start with pension, because that one is really what's going to be \u2013 the corporate AA bond rate at the end of 2015 will set whatever that pension cost is going to be. So you can look at the sensitivity that we have disclosed for 25 basis points movements there to tell you whether or not there should be anything that happens on the pension side. I think we will see \u2013 I don't think that we'll have big general wage inflation. I do think we'll potentially see some increase in overtime.","I think as we continue to invest in our rolling stock, we should see maintenance and repair stabilize. I would also expect that for some what I would call energy derivative consumables, we consume a lot of rubber, we consume a lot of lubricants and other types of energy derivative costs, explosives. I would expect that the benefit we've seen from diesel in 2015 begin to carry its way through those types of products as we move into 2016.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Good. That's helpful. And then switching gears to the legacy TXI cement contracts that are rolling off this year, where are we in that process of these contracts rolling off? I guess, how much more do we have as we're going here and going through the 4Q?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I mean, Ted, they'll be substantially gone by the end of the year. I mean \u2013 Ted, I'm sorry, Trey. They'll be substantially gone by year-end.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","And it was \u2013 as far as kind of how they rolled off, was 3Q a big chunk of it and then less in 4Q, or how do we measure that?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yes. The bigger chunk was in Q3.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then my last question is, I just want to make sure I understand some of the discussion around maintenance expense on the cement side.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Am I accurate in taking that you guys have lowered your maintenance expense a little bit for the \u2013 I guess, taking into account 3Q and then 4Q? Because I think the guidance was $6 million in 3Q, $14 million in 4Q, and I think you did just under that and expect that to double. So maybe it's a few million less in the 4Q than you originally expected. Is that accurate?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes. That's correct.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That is accurate. Yes.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll jump back in queue. I know there's more. Thanks.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks a lot, Trey.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Bibb of CJS Securities. Your line is open.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Hi. And I hope not to hammer on the same point too much, but I guess I'm trying to really understand what changed from the second quarter to the third quarter. The first half, you had lots of rain that was suppressing volumes. And you have a lot less rain in the third quarter, but volume growth slowed, price growth slowed. From what I've heard so far, it sounds like energy volumes in Texas is a chunk of that, or what am I missing here?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I think in large part, what \u2013 I'm not sure you're missing anything per se, Craig. I think a lot of it goes back to how much can the market absorb right now, given logistics and other downstream constraints that I think the market is just generally faced with as we speak. And I think a lot of the makeup \u2013 if you can give me a good sense of how long weather will at least be warm and dry into Q4, honestly, I think that's your big swing factor.","So what I'm more focused on is when I come back and take a look at pricing for the quarter, I'm not disappointed on pricing in the quarter. And again, I think pricing next year is going to be a very good story. And if we can run effectively through Thanksgiving, you can have a Q4 that could make up some of that volume. That's really your swing factor, Craig. I don't think we ever anticipated Q3 was going to be a period of time where you'd see a lot of makeup on that.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And when you're looking at nonresidential, your forecast of a slight or modest growth in 2016, is that based more on your bottoms-up process or the external data that you're using?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, it's pretty broadly macro with a dash of what we're seeing, again, very preliminarily relative to some of the local markets. I mean, obviously, we're going to come back when we get in Q1 and we roll up the full year and give you a sense of how we feel like all of that's going to roll up. But the fact is, if you look at the way that we've done it over the years, I think what you're going to find, Craig, is we tend to be relatively conservative in the way that we roll that up.","And I think that's one of the reasons that we're good on costs as well. I think good, slow, steady growth helps us relative to how we spend our dollars, how we hire people, and how we plan. So I think if there's a bias there built in, in Martin Marietta, it's one toward conservatism.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, I guess the disconnect is we kind of \u2013 we entered the year and \u2013 expecting to be on the cusp of an upturn in the construction cycle, and I think people are surprised to see volume growth expectations tapering down at this point.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Oh, yeah, I think the important thing to remember is we're talking about volume growth expectations, and I think the other thing to keep in mind is what we're doing with those volume growth expectations is putting some very serious money on the bottom line. So if you're looking at the performance of this business and what our people do, if there's anything in the performance of the business that's disappointing to people, I'm at a loss on what that can be. We can control a lot of things at Raleigh, Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, other places. Volume isn't necessarily one of them, but when it comes our way, we can make money with it. And that's very much what we're doing.","And, again, we're talking about growth. We're only quibbling over what the amount of growth is going to look like. And, again, if we're tending toward conservatism and we have downstream markets that are tough to take increased volume simply because you've got trucking and other issues that are under some degree of duress, I'm not sure that that's a fair view of a problem with the market, because we don't see that right now.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And could there be other issues in the fourth quarter related to weather from South Carolina or any -","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, look, weather has been a challenge. I mean very candidly, we've got a quarry north of Columbia, South Carolina, that has 4 billion gallons in it. I mean, the Broad River came out of its banks and filled it up. And we'll pump it out, and we'll put it right back in the Broad River. The quarry happens to be a rail-connected quarry. And as you'll recall, Craig, we've got the largest rail-connected quarry system in the United States in the Aggregates business. So we can go into the marketplaces that can now not be served by north Columbia by rail from other quarries, and we can equally come into markets by boat. So from a market service perspective, I don't think we're going to be that affected by it. From an efficiency perspective, can we be affected by it? Yeah. And I guess the other thing that I would say is insurance in circumstances like that is pretty difficult to have. So you, in large part, tend to be relatively self-insured. And so what I would tell you is there's going to be some capital that's going to be utilized in that as we go forward.","And the other thing, just in fairness, we did experience over the weekend pretty considerable rain events in Central and South Texas as well. And at our Webberville facility outside of Austin, we got a lot more water there than we typically would. And at Garwood Sand & Gravel which is typically a wet operation, we've had more water there than usual. Again, do I view these as material? No, I don't. Are they issues that can affect pure efficiencies in some markets? Sure. But, as we said in the commentary, relative to Q4, weather is the single most important variable on the way that quarter's going to play out.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","And you'll have the water back in the river by the end of the fourth quarter?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, we will not. I mean, when you've got a quarry that's got several billion gallons \u2013 and that's what it has, several billion gallons of water in it \u2013 you can expect that to take the better part of half a year as opposed to a matter of weeks or months.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks a lot, guys.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, thanks for sneaking me in again here at the very end. I just wanted to get some color on the net proceeds. Can you remind us what were the net proceeds of the sale of Oro Grande?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we sold OG for $420 million. We've got basically the $25 million that we referenced relative to some environmental indemnities and some inventory write-downs. So there's your quick math, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All rights, so that's it, there wasn't anything else. Okay. And you bought back $158 million of stock in the quarter, and I think you mentioned using the net proceeds from the sale to repurchase stock. This sale didn't occur until the end of the quarter, so how should we think about that net roughly \u2013 just call it rough numbers, $400 million? Is that still incremental, or was that $158 million kind of \u2013 should we take that out as we look forward, just as purely as the net as it relates to the proceeds from the sale of Oro Grande?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Trey, as we indicated, in anticipation of the sale, we went ahead and accelerated the purchase against that $420 million.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","So just net it out, Trey.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So you should net it out, and it will have the expectations that we should complete the balance of that.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot for clearing that up.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, Trey.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks again for joining our third quarter earnings call. We're enthusiastic about the opportunities to generate strong cash flow and return value to shareholders through our dividend and the repurchase program that we were just discussing. We look forward to talking with you more about our fourth quarter and full-year results with you in February.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. You may begin sir.","Howard Nye","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially.","Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings.","As detailed in our release distributed earlier this morning, Martin Marietta delivered strong topline and bottom line growth in the record setting second quarter. These results were driven by broad-based gains across the majority of the Company's geographic footprint. Importantly this was enabled by our strategic approach of developing leading positions in markets among high growth corridors possessing attractive near and long-term economic characteristics.","For the quarter, we delivered record net sales of $915 million, an increase of 8% or $65 million gain over the second quarter of last year. That increase combined with an improvement in our gross margin led to record gross profit and net earnings. In fact, gross profit increased $47 million and net earnings increased $40 million respectively. These outstanding results underscore the earnings power of our business model as well as the overall health of our markets and demonstrate our ability to capitalize on improving economic conditions.","Consolidated gross profit margin expanded 340 basis points to nearly 27% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90 increased 56% both compared with the prior year quarter. The efficiencies achieved our steadfast commitment to operational excellence is also evident and in that on a consolidated basis for every $1 in net sales our operations delivered $0.71 of additional gross profit above our stated target of 60%.","As will be expanded upon in a moment we're pleased to note that in addition to increased volume. Widespread pricing improvement contributed significantly to the quarter's results. Aggregates product line pricing increased 7% led by the West Group's 10% growth with notable strength across our Texas and Colorado footprints. The ready mixed concrete business delivered up 15% increase in pricing again with strength in both Texas and Colorado led by robust pricing along the I-35 corridor running from North to South through Dallas, Austin and San Antonio Texas.","Despite the near-term threefold impact of adverse weather conditions declining railroad balanced volumes and lower direct sale energy shipments. Our aggregates product line delivered volume growth of 1.3%. During the quarter poor whether in our top markets nearly rivaled that experienced in the second quarter of 2015. We faced extremely wet conditions particularly in the first two months of the second quarter in many of our key states including Texas and the Carolinas. As shown in the Divisional Precipitation Maps on Slide 5.","As forecasted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the El Nino weather pattern which began in the second quarter of 2015 continued through May 2016 What does that mean? Last year, we reported that enough rain fell in Texas to meet New York City's water needs for seven years.","This may the National Weather Service reported 35 trillion gallons of rain fell in Texas, enough to cover the entire state in water 8-inches deep. This rainfall led to extreme flooding due to saturated land conditions from an already very wet spring. Saturated soils are significant impediment to new construction activity.","The Mid-America Group led the Company with a nearly 5% increase in aggregates product line shipments driven by acceleration of residential and non-residential construction activity across the Carolinas. The Southeast Group\u2019s shipments increased nearly 2%, large infrastructure projects in Georgia and Florida were catalysts for growth in the Southeast Group, but were partially offset by lower ballast shipments.","The West Group were shipments were affected by heavy rainfall reported a 3% decline including the volumes related to the recently completed Colorado acquisitions. In addition to weather deferred shipments, the West Group aggregate product line volumes were impacted by decline in share related shipments, delays associated with several Texas Department of Transportation projects and lower balance sales due to reduced capital and maintenance expenditures by railroads as highlighted in recent press releases from that industry group. These factors drove the West Group\u2019s negative volume comparison to prior year.","Overall aggregate shipments for the first half of 2016 increased over 6% in line with our full-year expectations. The pace and trajectory of volume increases are particularly visible along the high growth corridors through the Carolinas, Georgia and into Florida. As anticipated economic recovery in the Southeastern United States is accelerating.","For example Georgia's net tax revenue collections through this past May compared to last year's comparable period were up nearly 10% or $1.7 billion. Further product demand in portions of the Carolinas have us considering adding work shifts to better serve customer needs. We expect continued steady construction growth in this important part of our geography to complement expansion in other regions of the country.","The ready mixed concrete product line is benefiting from strong demand in North Texas and Colorado. Robust volumes combined with improved cost performance together with modestly improving operating conditions drove over 43% increase in net sales and a 560 basis point expansion of gross margin. The expectation remains for our Texas ready mixed concrete profit margins to continue to improve similar to the pattern experienced in our Colorado based business. We view the results for the six months of the year is confirmation that our expectations are well placed.","For the second quarter the cement business generated nearly $60 million of net sales and $24 million of gross profit representing a 40% gross margin. Note as a result of the September 2015 sale of our California cement business, comparability of results for this segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California cement operations is detailed on Slide 6.","Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered another solid quarter with second quarter net sales of nearly $59 million. Our continued focus on diligently managing the cost profile of the business led to a gross profit margin of 36.8% and expansion of 170 basis points versus the prior year second quarter.","Varying degrees of construction recovery are visible in all three primary end use markets. Infrastructure shipments accounted for approximately 43% of our aggregates volume and increased 1.3% over the prior year quarter driven by large projects in the Southeast Group.","Notably the acceleration of projects in the Atlanta market along the I-85 and I-75 corridors in addition to continued I-4 activity in Central Florida enabled positive quarter-over-quarter growth despite the impact of weather delayed shipments in the Mid-America and West Groups.","Importantly we continue to see increasing demand across this end use market and remain confident in its steady and meaningful growth particularly as we move into 2017 and begin to see and enjoy the benefits of increased federal highway spending under the FAST Act and multiple state initiatives.","Among them the Texas Department of Transportation plans to spend $70 billion on its highways from 2017 to 2026 especially in the growing Martin Marietta Metro areas such as Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, and Houston doubling the prior decades record investment level. The nonresidential end use market comprised of two components light construction and heavy construction accounted for 33% of aggregate shipments in the quarter and increased 2.8% compared with the prior year quarter.","The light component is primarily office and retail construction with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand. For the heavy nonresidential component, is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy related activity. Growth in the nonresidential end use market was led by an approximate 14% increase in the Mid-America Group driven by office and retail development in North Carolina resulting from continued employment gains and solid residential activity.","The residential market accounted for 17% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a nearly a 11% increase compared with prior year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States as starts and completions are each up considerably for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016.","Although U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the reacceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the Southeastern portion the country is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the remainder of the year. The chem-rock\/rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of aggregates product line volumes which decreased compared to the prior year quarter as a result of reduced ballast sales.","In addition to our quarterly results presented in today's earnings release. We also provided two updates to portions of our previously provided guidance. First, SG&A guidance of $220 million has been increased to a range of $225 million to $230 million. This modest change is primarily related to the timing and value share-based compensation.","Second, the Company guidance on 2016 cement pricing changed. Current expectations are for full-year increase of 2% to 4%. This change lowered our full-year outlook for the cement businesses net sales by $10 million and results primarily from the sharp downturn in energy and energy related activity. We believe markets have now broadly stabilized and anticipate healthier pricing momentum as the Company benefits from its leading positions in high growth Texas regions.","To summarize our consolidated second quarter results by virtually every meaningful and controllable metric. Martin Marietta delivered a very strong quarter, highlighted by record net sales, record gross profit, and record net earnings. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, and amortization was over $266 million for the quarter, an increase of $60 million. EBITDA as a percentage of net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues expanded 478 basis points to over 29% approaching our prior peak level of EBITDA margin and 20% fewer tons.","During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 215,000 shares of our common stock for $40 million. And together with our dividend, we returned $66 million to our shareholders. We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the second quarter 2015, we've repurchased 4.5 million shares which coupled with our sustained dividend returned $869 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.5 million shares remain under the current authorization.","Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2016 was 1.98 times in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2 times. As you look forward to the balance of the year and beyond, we expect continued steady growth in construction activity in our markets. Both Dodge and PCA forecast growth and construction starts for the balance of 2016 and the next several years.","The Dodge momentum index, which measures the initial report of nonresidential construction projects and tends to lead nonresidential construction spending by one full-year increased over 11% in June to 134.4 is highest level since early 2009. Residential construction permits, starts and completions remain strong. Infrastructure activity should continue to accelerate as the FAST Act and other state initiatives drive increased construction of highways, streets, roads, and bridges.","Strong employment gains which serve as a key indicator of economic growth underpin the construction forecast. In fact of our key states Florida ranks second nationally in job growth, Texas ranks third, Georgia ranks fourth and North Carolina ranks eighth. A host of key metropolitan areas and our markets had employment gains above 3% including Dallas; and Austin, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Orlando, Tampa; and Jacksonville, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina.","To conclude we are very pleased with our second quarter performance and we're well-positioned to deliver solid results in the last half of the year. We will continue to realize the considerable benefits of our superior geographic positions, operating in markets that are economically diverse and high growth. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundational pillars of operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction, and sustainability and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.","If the operator will now give the required instructions. We'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. The first is really more on volumes and backlogs in particular. Could you give more color on backlogs, particularly areas affected by weather in the quarter, and how much do you think of the volume shortfall in the quarter was driven by weather and\/or delayed starts of projects? Thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you. Kathryn. What I would say is volumes were down approximately 2 million tons for the quarter based on what we thought it would be. And really as we rack it up it falls into three different buckets; number one, I would say shale volume was down about 750,000 tons versus the prior year. So that\u2019s your first bridge number.","Your second bridge number Kathryn should be on the railroad balance we saw that down about 250,000 tons compared to the prior year, but still the single largest moving factor there is relative to what we experienced with respect to weather. We're seeing tonnage affected by weather somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tons for the quarter. So that gives you your bridge.","The other part of your question I think it's a good one Kathryn is what are we looking at relative to backlogs and how does that feel and what I would say in particular Texas last year had the wettest May in history. This year it had one of the wettest May\u2019s in history. I mention that because if we simply look at a portion of that Texas market. Let's look at what we've got in North Texas. We've got about 3.6 million tons of backlog in North Texas and only about 600,000 of that shipped during the first half of 2016.","So clearly there is pretty considerable A backlog and pretty considerable jam up on that backlog. There is some big jobs that are really waiting to go in a more robust fashion U.S. 380 near Denton is one of them State highway 175 outside of Dallas is another and Interstate 45 and 35 both have considerable work.","So from a volume perspective what did we see deferred it was the 2 million tons broken down to those buckets that I gave you relative to large projects and what the backlog looks like. We feel very comfortable with our backlog at this position we just need to be able to go on a number of those jobs particularly text type jobs. Kathryn was that responsive?","Kathryn Thompson","Yes. That is very helpful. Do you have any parameters how we can think about it for two other important States Colorado and North Carolina?","Howard Nye","Well here's what I would say with respect to Colorado. Colorado had a much better quarter. If we look at what's going on in Colorado with the Rocky Mountain Group, what I would tell is everything within the borders of Colorado is really very healthy. The only place in the Rocky Mountain Group that we're seeing any degree of volume struggle is outside of Colorado. Where it's more ballast driven. ","o we do have some ballast quarries in Utah, we have one up in Wyoming as well, so we are seeing some pressure at those back to those same issues that we discussed before. What I would tell you is what we're seeing in Metro Denver, what we're seeing North of Denver, what we're seeing South of Denver whether it\u2019s aggregates, ready mix or hot mix is all a very, very healthy market place, particularly on downstream paving we're getting considerably more work this year than we were last year at the same time. I want to say for the quarter, we had been on nearly 35 more jobs in Metro in North than we had bid on last year.","So we see Colorado being very busy not just for the balance of this year, we see Colorado being very busy for next year. With respect to the other part of your question on North Carolina, we\u2019re seeing a very healthy Charlotte, so that's been a market that has continued to perform well importantly as we go East out of Charlotte and get to the triad, we're seeing considerably more infrastructure work in Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem. That's a part of the state because of textiles, furniture and other manufacturing that suffered more than the rest of the state.","We are now seeing both residential and nonresidential recovery in the end marketplace. As we come farther East yet and hit Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill, infrastructure work here is very healthy, multifamily residential has been very, very healthy, residential is starting to move in the direction that we would expect. So again, we're seeing a much healthier North Carolina. The part of this state is still waiting for more economic juice to hit it are the more coastal areas that are continuing to get better and better quarter after quarter. So I did want to make sure I went through those areas pretty clearly with you Kathryn.","Kathryn Thompson","Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. And one follow-up related to rails. One, I just wanted to make sure that I'm correct in thinking that rail operators can kick the can down the road only so far in terms of deferring maintenance CapEx. And then second along with that was just really a separate subject, but how do you think Martin's cost structure maybe impacted in the future by various changes that the rail operators are currently undergoing.","Howard Nye","Kathryn, I guess I\u2019ll respond to your first comment and really just agree to it. Maintenance is something that in the early and since with the downturn is always going to see this pull back. And I think that's exactly what the railroads are doing and I think it's fairly predictable once they saw their volumes declining. That cannot endure because they have thousands of miles of track that they do need to maintain. So that's not a matter of \u2013 yes, it's a matter of when.","I think with respect to the second part of your question, I think what's going to happen is aggregate business will likely get better service on the railroads because we have been a very steady customer all the way through. So if you go back to the notion that we\u2019re the largest shipper of stone on four out of the five class 1 railroads and our network is at least double the next largest network. Our ability I believe to move stone from stone producing areas to stone starved parts of the country particularly in South Texas and along the Gulf and the Atlantic coast well oddly enough most likely be helped by this circumstance.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. Thank you very much.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Good afternoon, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Howard, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about just the chem-rock\/rail guidance for the year, so year-to-date that part of your business was down 19%. And I think your full-year guidance implies a significant pick up in the back half of the year. But as we step through the qualitative comments on the call, I just want to make sure that still reflects your current views on that end market.","Howard Nye","I think it does right now Jerry, keep in mind that the numbers that we put out at the beginning of the year were based on the ballast numbers that we had been supplied by the class 1 railroads. So again, the dialog is active with them. They\u2019ve been very clear that it was going to be back half pushed. If we're looking simply to the degree that car volume or others down on the different railroads. I mean the fact is we can look at year-to-date car volume and see UP is down 10%, CSX is down almost 7%, Norfolk Southern is down almost 6%.","See if we clearly see why they would pull back. I think going back to Kathryn\u2019s point and her question, it can only be held back so long and keep in mind a lot of these places to have seen pretty considerable flooding in the first half of the year. So where you've got railroads that have been underwater and have seen that type of duress they will have needs as we head into the back half of the year.","Now in fairness, if we're looking at what headwinds and tailwinds could be and it's probably a good moment to think about that as we deal with this question. I would clearly put that in a potential headwind for us as we go into the back half of the year. So I really think about those probably in two different tranche Jerry. I think tailwinds that we have going into the back half of the year is the rate and trajectory of recovering the Carolinas in the Southeast and some of that by the way could be ballast.","I think another tailwind that we have is strong demand in the Midwest in the Rocky Mountains and I think a strong contractor backlog is a tailwind as well. So I think you got those three, but I do think that if you're looking at what the headwinds are. I think the ballast shipments could be a headwind and if we don't see some improvement at the back half of the year, they're probably 600,000-ish tons that could be at risk there. Here clearly we do need good, normal weather for the balance of the year and we do need text that to have more of their work go on in a more timely basis.","The other issue and I don't think the railroads necessarily suffer from this, but I think a lot of other trades do right now getting truck drivers, tradesmen, welders, other things simply within the supply chain are under varying degrees of duress in different parts of the country. So I do think there are some headwinds. I do think there are some tailwinds, and I give you that in the context that I do believe ballast is the potential headwind.","Anne Lloyd","And Jerry just a reminder that chem-rock\/rail segment only about I guess 3 percentage points of that is ballast and it also has agricultural mine and other chemical grade stone, so there are other factors that could potentially mitigate that volume guidance.","Jerry Revich","Okay. I appreciate the color. And then can you talk about across your footprint, what are you hearing regarding the pace of public construction work ramping up versus your expectations, so I guess it sounded like last quarter projects got moving a little bit faster than we expected. Is that \u2013 was that effectively if you look at it now some pull forward demand and things are evening out now or what's your take on the pace of public activity that we saw in the quarter outside of the weather issues that you outlined?","Howard Nye","I think you are seeing a pickup, but we\u2019ve always said it was going to be more of a 2017 event than it was going to be a 2016 event. I think our verb age in the past is because of how long we had gone without a highway build. It was more likely than usual that we might see some of that activity in the second half of 2016. So it's fascinating to look at it where it was happy. I mean Street starts were down 16%, but again our view was we're going to see unexpected recovery and have to and really more going into 2017.","What's fascinating to me Jerry is to go back and take a look at some of the key states and look at it over not a several month period, but over 2014 to 2016 timeframe relative to this subject. And this is what I find, North Carolina, the change on a percentage 2014 to 2016, 58%. Nebraska, same timeframe, up 41%. Iowa, up 18%. Arkansas, up 11%. South Carolina, up 53%. Florida, up 18% with that same timeframe because you did see a pullback is Texas down? It is, but again it's just seemed that normal give and take in that.","So again I'm not sure that we're seeing anything relative to public transportation. This is surprising to us. I think we see good momentum going into the back half of the year and I think we see very good momentum going into 2017.","Jerry Revich","And based on the common or good momentum heading into the back year, it sounds like weather and shipments normalized in July and I think is the implication of that comment, is that fair?","Howard Nye","Jerry, I don\u2019t want to talk specifically about July until we are talking in November. Obviously, you can see what we've done with our guidance and the resilience that we have around that.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you very much.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","Thank you. First question is just on incremental margins, you've got paced your long-term targets in the second quarter. It seems like to hit the midpoint of your guidance, you need somewhere around 60% so inline with the long-term, but can you talk about some of the levers that you saw in the second quarter in particular on lower volumes you got 70% consolidated incremental margins, which is pretty strong. And what are you seeing as far as the levers of Boston incrementals in the back half of the year and could we perhaps see some conservatism in the incremental margin guidance in the near-to-medium term?","Howard Nye","Garik I guess a couple of things number one I think we need to really give a tip of that have to our operating teams. Because operating in the type of environment in which they're operating is really challenging because it's stop start and these businesses don't do stop start very well. Here's what I am tell you so look at the cost structure momentum on the labor side has been very good. Momentum on energy has been very good. Momentum on maintenance and repair his gotten considerably better.","I mean one of the things that we did last year in particular as we have accelerated the purchase of some rolling stock particularly the Midwestern United States. And in some of my earlier comments I spoke to the fact that that's going to be a business that's going to be as busy this year as it can be until snow flies there. And what we saw with incremental additions to rolling stock in that marketplace as we saw maintenance repair it considerably better.","So again our cost structure is doing what I believe our cost structure we're doing again our teams have done exceptional work. The other piece of that I think worth remembering is in large part we're watching the price fall to the bottom line. And that has really been very powerful and if you think about what\u2019s you're seeing relative to the price increases.","You've heard us say not for a matter of months, but you've heard to say for a matter of years. It would be most likely that you would see the Western United States on a percentage basis price increase outperform the Eastern United States and particularly in parts of Texas. And that's what we're seeing. I think the other thing to your point Garik on what it looks like going forward, part of what I believe you've heard us refer to in the past.","Is that we believed in time Colorado would start to see that same type of pricing performance with the lag behind Texas. We're starting to see evidence of that taking shape as well. So to your question on incrementals cost performance has been really very good. Capital deployment has continued to drive down costs in areas that needed to drive down, prices fall into the bottom line and importantly it's doing exactly what we thought. And keep in mind we thought we would see these that are incrementals early on in the cycle. So far no surprises.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks. I just want to switch cement for a second of cement pricing you did lower your guidance. Again I think wanted to get some clarity on a comment in the release pricing was down slightly ahead of price increases just want to get more and with that meant and also may be get your take on how the July 1 increases have taken hold in the Texas market?","Howard Nye","No I guess a couple of things Garik. There were July increases in the Texas market we anticipate more coming in October as well that's what drives the two to four pricing that we're showing up. Clearly from when we spoke about Texas on the last earnings call we said we thought Q1 maybe going into Q2 was going to be a shake out period for pricing in Texas.","Obviously you\u2019ve got imports that have come in at least the Port of Houston that are modestly different than we see over the last several years. At the same time part of what we're doing particularly in North Texas is we're serving more of our own cement needs in that marketplace as well. So what we're looking at for that shipping more cement farther to feed some of our ready mixed operations and you've also got some of the competitive postures that have been in that marketplace.","That to my - in my way of thinking is what has really held the price down in addition to the weather that we saw. So as we look at it clearly pricing in North Texas is better than it's been in South Texas we're seeing increases in both markets and we feel like we've now seen nice stability in that marketplace. I can tell you we're seeing bidding in North Texas today that number is much closer to the 112, 113, 114 type numbers and that's more in line with what we would have expected.","Garik Shmois","Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Garik.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Bibb of CJS Securities.","Craig Bibb","Thanks for taking my question. Dallas ready mix market looked particularly strong I'm assuming what\u2019s the strength was Dallas or was that evenly spilt with Colorado?","Howard Nye","The ready mix market generally looks pretty strong but I would tell you is the Colorado ready mix market is particularly strong. I mean is Dallas doing better? It is Dallas is doing considerably better. So we need to start with that, but if we're looking at it just what's going on relative to ASP. ASP in the Texas market have clearly outperformed we're looking at ASPs in that overall market in the Southwest up almost 17%.","So if we're looking at that type of performance in Texas it's much better, but I'll tell you as we look across five different districts of ready mix in that marketplace there\u2019s only one that has ASP\u2019s less than $100 a cubic yard. That's getting them to a much more acceptable type of level. So yes it's getting better in Texas, fall weather was really wet and was not necessarily ready mix\u2019s friend, weather was still better than it was last year during the same time, Craig. So those are your drivers. ","Craig Bibb","Okay. Is there any thing that\u2019s likely to slowdown the Dallas or Colorado ready mix market?","Howard Nye","You know what I\u2019ll say we\u2019ll just work our way North to South again everything that we see in Colorado right now looks incredibly healthy, public looks healthy, private looks healthy, both res and non-res. So we feel good about that entire I-25 corridor. As we're looking in our ready mix business in Texas keep in mind it's principally going to be more North Texas driven than anything else.","As we look just broadly across our business footprint from an aggregate perspective and keep in mind we want to feed ourselves, our own aggregates and our ready mix business. About 45% of our aggregate volume in Texas is North Texas driven about 30% is Central Texas driven, 15% Houston driven, 9% South Texas driven. We don't have any ready mix in Houston which is probably the single most challenged market in Texas. That's my way of coming back to your very good question. ","Now we feel pretty good about where we are in the ready mix business in Texas. Despite the notion of where you are matters and where you want to be vertically integrated matters even in a vertically integrated market you want to be careful. And I believe that's what we've done in Texas.","Craig Bibb","Okay. And then in Houston switching gears a little bit your competitor was talking about a lull and large project activity along the coast are you guys seeing those?","Howard Nye","We are actually seeing regional activity along the Gulf Coast and the large energy projects that I know. My recollection is they spoke about 30% down in Houston yesterday we're not seeing a number like that, we're seeing a number closer to half of that. But again if you look at the way that our business is built in Texas, we're primarily a North Texas driven Company not a South Texas driven company. So the percentage is will be hard to be apples-to-apples.","Craig Bibb","Okay. And the slowdown with the Texas DOT even with a benefit of proposition one and I guess seven that\u2019s just a timing issue or how did that happen given the incremental funds they have?","Howard Nye","Yes, I think the biggest issue that you've got in Texas is not a lack of work or a lack of potential volumes. So I think the biggest issue that you\u2019ve got in Texas candidly is you\u2019ve got Texas DOT feeling a little bit of growing pains right now because they have let so much work, record work on top of record work that on occasion now they're running into you know we've got a right of way issue here we need to deal with. Or we have the utility issue here that we need to deal with.","So I don't think there is any funding issue at all in Texas right now and I think particularly in North Texas what really needs to happen is there more you hate to say it's administrative but it's almost a first cousin to administrative issues that TXDOT needs to work its way through. I don't have any doubt that they will. I don't think anyone in Texas has any doubt that they will. As I said it's not a matter of, yes its a matter of when.","Craig Bibb","Okay, great. Well thanks a lot.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Craig.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Timna Tanners","Yes, hey good afternoon guys.","Howard Nye","Hello, Timna.","Timna Tanners","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the M&A market. I know that you always highlight your share repurchase program. But just want to get any thoughts about the uses of cash particularly M&A.","Howard Nye","Well, Timna. As you know that\u2019s really number one on the hit parade as far as the uses of cash going forward and the point I\u2019ll say is that we have been engaged in a lot of dialogue and we're talking to a lot of closely held family businesses in particular. And one of the recurring themes that I hear is that if family owned businesses are looking to potentially make moves with your businesses, selling into what they feel like there's an up cycle. It's a pretty sensible thing for them to do.","Now you should equally expect us to be thoughtful around value and not put ourselves for the position that we're overpaying. But at the same time in a marketplace I think where people can look at our space and say this looks like it's going to be pretty good for three or four or maybe five years. If you're a family owned business and you've been through a particularly difficult time over the last ten years. They are probably doing some real soul searching right now and we want to be there to help them.","Timna Tanners","Okay. That's helpful. In the last conference call I had written down that you are seeing some cement shortages in Texas this year and I know you noted that there is a little more import, but can you give us a little bit more color about what changed and how you see the market going forward?","Howard Nye","Actually what I think I said Timna was if we had demand that we thought we're going to have in Texas, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw cement shortages toward the end of the year, so clearly I was saying that before we had 8-inches of potential rain flooding across the entire state of Texas. So I guess my view was is not that far removed from where PCA is, because if we look at what we think to be capacity additions to Texas over the next several years and who knows if all of those come forward.","Even with those capacity additions, what you're seeing is about a 3 million ton per annum shortfall of cement. So for Texas, it's not hedge genuinely for a 24-month period is normal weather. They have not had a normal Texas summer and our sense is that's going to happen. And when that happens in construction activity on the public side which is half of our business is as robust as we believe it will and from places like Dallas continue to be as they are today, the best housing market in the United States. Those were the types of formulas that come together to create cement shortages in that type of circumstance.","Timna Tanners","Okay. I understand. Thank you. And then, it\u2019s only other thing I want to ask about is just in light of your comments on the energy sector troughing, how should we think about that type of recovery that your customers are signaling to you or how to think about what that could look like going forward coming out of a trough?","Howard Nye","Energy looks like coming out of a trough?","Timna Tanners","Your tonnage in energy end markets, yes.","Howard Nye","Here is the way to think of it. If we are looking for the quarter just for the quarter on what we sold directly to shale energy. We sold about 292,000 tons to the shale sector in the quarter. To give you a compare, last year in the second quarter a little bit over 1 million tons and that wasn't going a great guns last year. This sector doesn't stay down. This sector is going to have to have a return.","Do I think this sector is going back to the type of volume that we were seeing in 2014 which by the way was almost 7.5 million tons? I don't think it goes there. But I think it could very well go back to numbers that we were seeing at least in 2015 or maybe in 2016. If we look at full-year 2016, that was 3.6 million tons, so basically half of what it had been in 2014. I'm not sure that that is somewhere between that 2.5 and 3.5 wouldn't be a good steady run rate for energy as it returns. And again I think we're particularly well placed to serve that what it does.","Timna Tanners","Okay. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Timna.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey Grooms","Hey, good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hello, Trey.","Trey Grooms","Howard, first question would be on the tonnage impacted by weather, I think you called out like 1 or maybe 1.5 million tons, just let me get a sense for when this can come through. I know there's a lot of moving pieces there, but if it were going to hit in 2Q and were delayed would that come through in the back half of the year or would that be something that would be more likely to add it to 2017?","Howard Nye","Trey, I think that's a great question. I think a lot of that's going to be weather driven because if we end up with heavy hurricane season in the Carolinas, or Florida, or Georgia is going to be tough. If we end up with an early winter in Iowa and Colorado, it could be tough. On the other hand, if we have a dry Q3 and late winter, frankly you could make up a lot of that.","I think one of the biggest issues and as you recall when I was going through the question that Jerry had. I've talked about both headwinds and tailwinds and I do think that issue, that tailwind issues that I described or the headwind issues on work crews, drivers, technical trades and those types of things, in other words everything that's in the supply chain. And again, we saw some of this last year or two when we had that wet weather coming out of Q2. I think that may end up being an issue that's hard for us to measure right now, but my guess is that something that you're hearing in the marketplace as you do your channel checks too.","Trey Grooms","Got it. Okay, but hopefully the weather will cooperate for you guys. I guess the next one would be on specialty products. I think in the guidance there are some implied acceleration there. Can you talk about what's driving that, is that mostly related to your expectations due to steal price movement or just any color you can give?","Howard Nye","No. We're seeing good MagChem work right now. I mean we've really if we're looking at what's going on in the steel industry. The steel industry for us if you're looking at the two components to drive that business broadly. It's what's going on the still capacity that's what about 72% which is a perfectly fine place for to be if it's above 70 we're going to find.","Equally if you take a look at where we are relative to what's going on with natural gas pricing. You've got a 21% cost reduction versus the prior year. So if you've got steel that over 70 you've got nat gas down 21% that helps a lot, but then when you've got good business on the MagChem side and keep in mind I want to say historically by 12%, 13% of our revenue is going overseas and that business. May be a little bit more right now.","So the type of business that we're seeing that we think doesn't just have a quarter-to-quarter type of impact to it. But likely has a multiple year impact to it. It's actually very attractive to us right now.","Trey Grooms","Okay and I'm not sure how much you can go into detail on this one, but you guys were purchased about $190 million worth of stock I think year-to-date and your balance sheets still going to be in very good shape and within your parameters well below your parameters by the end of the year if you kind of keep that pace up, but do you expect that the cadence could increase in the back half as we see free cash flow generation likely improving in the back half of the year?","Howard Nye","I guess a lot of a difference on what the market opportunities are relative to transactions that we think are attractive because again we're going to look at a purchase of ordinary evidence saying where they were going to look at a purchase of a business that's out there right now. Of course a number of businesses that may come up often times and that being opportunistic.","The other thing that I would encourage you to do and you obviously are by the nature of your question where are we on our net debt EBITDA ratio because we told you we were going to keep it right about the two times. And in the prepared remarks I had we were right at 1.98. So we have that bad habit of trying to do is say we're going to do. So will probably keep it right at that level and then much of its going to be driven by what's the opportunity looks like.","Trey Grooms","Fair enough and last one for me and this is just a quick one on pricing for aggregates? Was there any geographic meaningful kind of mix or maybe even product mix, impact on the pricing in the quarter?","Howard Nye","Nope we took a deep dive on that as you'd expect us to and neither geography note product really moved around this time. So what you see is what you get.","Trey Grooms","Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.","Howard Nye","Thanks Trey. See you soon.","Trey Grooms","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel Nicolaus.","Stanley Elliott","Hi, thank you guys for taking my question.","Howard Nye","Sure, Stanley.","Stanley Elliott","A quick question, the ready mix have been really, really strong. How much longer maybe could you help us frame this out kind of what inning you think we are in the recovery of this business. And how we should think about that on the go forward basis?","Howard Nye","First, I guess what I would say on the ready mix business from an inning perspective it's a more mature ballgame in Colorado that it is - in Texas right now relative to Denver and the marketplace North. So if you think back to it what we've done in growing that business in Colorado all the way down the front range, all the way down I-25 has really given more breadth and depth to that marketplace.","So we're looking at ASP's in the Rocky Mountains for example that are higher than they are in the Southwest. And that's one reason I say that it's a more mature business, but I would say the Southwest is if we're looking at the type of growth that I believe we're looking at in North Texas.","If we're looking at the type of growth that I think we're looking at and the other markets that are close to that and with some of the large vertically integrated jobs that we have been South Texas that have multiple years ahead of them. Again I would say this is a game that is in relatively early innings in Texas right now.","If you go back to the comments that I had in my prepared remarks we anticipate seeing from return in another perspective the Texas business looking more and more like the Colorado business. And as we said we believe the results that we've seen so far this year in particular the results that that we saw on this quarter is good evidence that the team is moving it there. We've got a very capable management team that oversees this business. They know exactly what our aims and desires are and they're doing a very fine job right now meaning that.","Stanley Elliott","Great. And go back to the balance sheet from a capital standpoint, obviously strong credit rating, if you want to say around this two times leverage target. My guess and I think a lot of people are out there we should see EBITDA growth pretty significantly over the next couple of years. What are the thoughts on taking advantage of some of the tracks of rates you could get now versus the 2018 notes you have at 6 and 6.6 I believe given the outlook for the business and the momentum that you're seeing it right now.","Anne Lloyd","Stanley if you take a look at that those transactions if we were to execute today either at low rates would be NPV negative. So we obviously are looking at them to determine whether or not we should pull some of that forward and refinance. Our whole capital allocation strategy is to maintain the financial flexibility of the business to invest in acquisitions that come along at the right \u2013 the right acquisition in the right markets for the right price to fully fund what we need from an organic and capital perspective.","And then maintaining net debt-to-EBITDA two times which as Trey indicated earlier means there will need to be some type of incremental activity that takes place in the second half of the year to do that, should our expectations fall through. And then just keeping up with that financial flexibility to execute against the M&A opportunities when they present themselves on a broader scale.","Howard Nye","And Stanley the other thing that I would add is and Anne alluded to it. Obviously we're putting CapEx into the business right now ahead of DD&A and part of what we've always discussed is DD&A which runs today is about $275 million is not a bad proxy for you to have in the back of your mind on what our stay in business CapEx needs are. And we're anticipating about a $350 million capital spend this year.","And if you go back to part of what we discussed earlier about what capital is doing at times for our cost structure and part of what I\u2019ve referenced before is the dialogue we're having particularly on the rolling stock in the Midwest and United States. Making sure we're in a position to invest in the right way at the right time there is really important too. So it all rolls together very seamlessly.","Stanley Elliott","Yes. Absolutely. And just to clarify did I hear you say you're looking to hire some new shifts in Carolinas? Was that what I had heard? ","Howard Nye","I think what you heard was as it\u2019s contemplating the need to do that to better meet customer needs. So in large part what I'm trying to say is it's getting awfully better in the Carolinas.","Stanley Elliott","Sounds like a high class problem. So congratulations and best of luck.","Howard Nye","Thanks, Stan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Norfleet with Alembic Global Advisors.","Robert Norfleet","Good afternoon, guys.","Howard Nye","Hi, Rob.","Robert Norfleet","Just a quick question. Can you kind of discuss Ward how you guys assess returns and as it relates to buying existing capacity that being acquisitions versus Greenfield opportunities in Brownfield growth opportunities such as opening a new quarry or expanding existing production sites from an IRR perspective?","Howard Nye","What we're always going to run a model on it, we're doing transactions we're going to look at a 15% IRR on a post tax basis I mean that's going to be the beginning of the analysis.","Anne Lloyd","Yes, just obtain your DCF on that.","Howard Nye","But Rob at the end of the day it's going to be driven by what our strategic plan says. I mean keep in mind if you remember those debts that we've gone through we look at our markets very clearly, protect, expand, hold, target, exit and depending on what a market is going to dictate how we look at that market how we want to invest in it or otherwise. The other thing that we're mindful of we have the ability to Greenfield. We've clearly done that in places like Wadena we're going to do some of that in Hunter.","I think we've done that very well I think we've done more of that probably than others in the space. At the same time if we go back to eight, nine years ago this was a company that was producing and selling 205 million tons of stone on a pre-TXI basis. So really if we\u2019re looking at Greenfielding in markets they're going to need to be compelling reasons why to do that because there's really not a lot of need right now to add capacity to the greater need is greater efficiencies and to find those attractive markets where we want to have a more compelling presence.","So to the extent that we can look to drive the marketplace in which we have a one or two position that right now it\u2019s 85% of our markets or 65%. Let's call it six years ago. If we can take that 85% percent number up to 95% or to 90% and keep doing that. That's an awfully good and high use for our dollars. So that's how we're going to think about that.","Anne Lloyd","And Rob if we laid out in Investor Day we are always a pretty solid land buyer we had a big buy in land last year and we will always look for those opportunity for acquiring new properties whether they be appended to existing operations or whether the property for a future Greenfield. ","Robert Norfleet","Okay. That makes sense. And again I was asking kind of on the follow-up of Timna\u2019s question on M&A because you know clearly over the last six to 12 months. It looks like we've seen a number of deals going multiples north of nine and in some cases north of 10 times EBITDA. And typically you guys target wanting to pay seven to eight times and some of these assets that have been sold heavy, heavy competitive downstream businesses. So I'm just I'm curious if you really able to find that sweetspot where you've been able to get assets for seven, eight times or seen where we\u2019re seeing similar to exorbitant multiples paid for some transactions?","Howard Nye","You know what it's interesting Rob because I think the multiple paid is really from our perspective going to be driven by where the business is because candidly our view of what you pay on a sand and gravel business versus what you pay on a hard rock business may vary. Our view of what you may pay for granite hard rock business versus the limestone hard rock business may vary. Our view may vary on open-pit versus underground. So would there be times that we could look at in some markets a double-digit EBITDA multiple absolutely there are times we could do that. Would we rather not? I mean obviously we would rather not. But again it's going to be driven more by the marketplace. It's going to be driven by the plant and it\u2019s going to be driven by a long-term and near-term view.","Robert Norfleet","Okay, great. And my last question. Can you just kind of walk us through in the core states that you operate in funding bills that are being voted on or moving through the various approval stages that could provide additional funds for infrastructure funding. And then secondly to that we\u2019ve obviously seen success with the DOT\u2019s TIGER grant program and its contribution to funding projects. Do you think or what's your opinion of that program being renewed since obviously there's not a multi-year authorization. ","Howard Nye","Sure. Let's talk about it in a couple different tranches. I mean if we look at it in new money terms and not all of this is new, but some of the hit from some of this is going to be relatively new. I will put in a $0.10 gas tax effect at March 1, 2015 that\u2019s going to basically give that state about a 30% increase in construction activity. That matters to us. Obviously, with House Bill 157 last year, Georgia basically increased their gas tax. They added almost $1 billion to annual construction budgets. We think both the Georgia and the Iowa pieces of it probably fit obviously more meaningfully in 2017, but we do think the back half of 2016 could see some activity from that.","Obviously, Texas has just a very healthy lighting schedule and they have for the last several years. That's going to continue to build on itself. I think the notions that we've discussed around project delays, administrative is something to be mindful of in Texas. Keep in mind, the Prop 7 money is coming when we get to September 2017 that should be about $2.5 billion per annum. Nebraska did not to the same degree that I would did that they put in a gas tax increase of $0.015 on January 1, that's going to go up that same amount for the next three years, so it adds up to a $0.06 increase. That's going to be about a $75 million total impact in that state and we've got a very attractive position there.","If we look at what's happened in North Carolina last year with the legislature was in session. They basically added almost $1 billion to highway transportation spending, but what North Carolina refers to as the Biennium. So that's a two-year process. South Carolina is looking to do more with what they call their pennies for progress program, which we'd be delighted to see them do. Again, the work that we're seeing in South Carolina right now in Charleston is very robust work.","What we're seeing in Columbia is very good work, and equally Mike Pence as Governor of Indiana wanted to see if he keeps his job as Governor of Indiana, because apparently he's running for another one. And he's looking to invest an additional $1 billion in states, roads, highways, bridges over a four-year period there. So again, we've got a number of core states that matter a lot to us that do have a series of good initiatives coming behind them. TIGER Grants Program, you know what I don't have. We would just have to see where that goes up. I\u2019ll tell you I'm still one of those people who feels like the TIFIA program and where it's going to be impactful, can and will be going into the future.","Remember, what we've seen in TIFIA since 2012 is the $49 billion investment, so and in markets that we care deeply about right now, we've seen two new applications and in calendar 2015 and 2016 including a couple of projects in Colorado worth $1.7 billion on I-70 and 470 the loop and then about a $1.4 billion DFW project, the Midtown Express and then we're still waiting for the Monroe Bypass in Charlotte to go and that's about an $839 million job. So I think we would have to see what happens with TIGER Grants, but I think between the FAST Act state initiatives and what we've seen in TIFIA it's pretty good future.","Robert Norfleet","Great. Thanks a lot for the color. I appreciate it.","Howard Nye","You are welcome. Thank you for the questions.","End of Q&A","Operator","And I\u2019m not showing any further question at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Howard Nye for closing remarks.","Howard Nye","Thanks again for joining our second quarter 2016 earnings call. As I think you can tell, we believe we're poised to deliver a great 2016. We continue to experience strong employment growth in our key states, good robust construction activity with increased materials demand and significant pricing opportunities. Our teams focused execution of our plan should provide a firm foundation enhancing long-term shareholder value.

And welcome to the Martin Marietta Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ashley and I will be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the Company\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.","Suzanne Osberg","Good morning. And thank you for joining Martin Marietta's second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website Q2 2018 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends.","As detailed on slide two, this teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance.","Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Please note that all financial and operating results discussed today are for second quarter 2018. Any comparisons are versus the prior year quarter, unless otherwise noted, and all margin references are based on revenues. Adjusted results exclude acquisition-related net expenses and the impact of selling acquired inventory after its mark-up to fair value in accordance with acquisition accounting. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q2 2018 supplemental information and SEC filing.","We will begin today's earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our second quarter operating performance and market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. And a question-and-answer session will follow these prepared remarks.","I will now turn the call over to Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Suzanne. And thank you all for joining today's teleconference.","Martin Marietta achieved record second quarter revenues; profitability; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA; and diluted earnings per share. These impressive results were driven by disciplined execution of our strategic plan as we continue to operate safely and efficiently while benefiting from the steady, ongoing, multiyear construction recovery.","Our strong second quarter results reflect increased shipment volumes in our Building Materials business, continued pricing momentum and contributions from completed acquisitions. We're especially pleased with the performance of our recently acquired Bluegrass Materials operations, which remain on track to ship approximately 13 million tons of aggregates this year at overall EBITDA margins of at least 50%. Integration is substantially complete and synergy realization is progressing as planned.","In addition to our aggregates-led growth in the eastern United States in late June, we also acquired several sand and gravel operations and a permitted Greenfield site in Omaha, Nebraska, adding approximately 30 million tons of aggregate reserves to our Midwest business. These growth initiatives, both large and small, demonstrate that our prudent capital deployment strategy is delivering significant value to our shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders.","Looking beyond this quarter. We remain encouraged by favorable market trends, ongoing customer optimism and positive third-party forecasts. Underlying product demand and customer backlogs remain strong, most notably in Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, and Iowa, underscoring the strength and health of the markets in which we operate. We expect increased levels of building activity and continued favorable pricing trends in the second half of 2018 and into the future as the construction recovery strengthens. This sentiment is echoed by our sales teams, customers and suppliers. Consistent with these trends, 2018 is shaping up to be another record year for Martin Marietta. And as announced in today's release, we raised our full-year EBITDA guidance to a midpoint of $1.235 billion.","Demand for our construction products is growing, and we have both the ability and capacity to supply the needed building materials. However, transient contract capacity and freight constraints compounded by lost weather days that are difficult to recover can meter the pace of construction activity. Our second quarter results illustrate this point as railroad service issues, finite truck availability, and contractor labor shortages slowed overall second quarter heritage aggregates volume growth to 3%. This is still solid growth but not enough to satisfy demand for our products at this time. Fortunately, we expect these temporary bottlenecks to ease and throughput to improve as the construction sector attracts capital investment and provides increased wages.","For the first time in 24 months, heritage aggregates shipments increased in each of the Company's three primary end-use markets. Heritage aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market increased 2%. Our Mid-Atlantic Division posted double-digit volume growth, driven by several large public projects in North Carolina, including the Interstate 77 Express Lanes in Charlotte and the Greenville Bypass in the eastern half of the state. Unplanned project delays in Texas and Colorado as well as continued poor railroad service in Texas, South Georgia and Florida limited infrastructure shipments and construction activity in these regions. We expect sustained but manageable railroad service issues over the next three to six months.","Heritage aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market remained below the company's most recent 5-year average of 43%. As state Departments of Transportation, or DOTs, and contractors address labor constraints and the broader industry benefits from further regulatory reform, we're confident that funding provided by the Fixing America's Service Transportation Act, or FAST Act, together with numerous state and local transportation initiatives will translate into further increased product demand. We're also encouraged by recent acceleration of state lettings and contract awards, notably in Texas and North Carolina. However, some contractors are reporting a longer lag time between contract awards and project commencement. Public construction projects are almost always completed once awarded, so we know this work is coming. We believe that the impact of these delays, inclement weather conditions and other temporary factors described earlier will extend but not limit the construction cycle of the company's single largest end-use market.","Heritage aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market increased 6% in the second quarter, driven by both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors across many of our key markets. Ongoing energy sector project approvals, supported by sustained higher oil prices, bode well for increased aggregates consumption generated from the next wave of these projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Numerous projects are expected to bid in 2018, with construction activity beginning in 2019 and beyond. The nonresidential market represented 33% of second quarter heritage aggregates shipments.","Heritage aggregates shipments to the residential market increased 11% in the second quarter. We believe the home building industry is now beginning to address the shortage of single-family housing units, particularly entry-level homes. Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia and South Carolina consistently ranked at the top 10 states nationally for growth in single-family housing unit starts. Inclusive of Iowa, Maryland and Indiana, growth in single-family housing unit permits for our top nine states outpaced the national average.","The outlook for residential construction remains robust, particularly in Martin Marietta's leading Southeast and Southwest states, driven by positive employment and population trends, land availability and efficient permitting. Continued strength in residential construction should serve as a catalyst for future nonresidential and the infrastructure activity. The residential market accounted for 22% of second quarter aggregates shipments.","To conclude our discussion on end-use markets, heritage aggregates shipments to the ChemRock\/Rail market accounted for the remaining 5% of second quarter shipments and declined 21%. Lower ballast volumes reflect both reduced maintenance spending by Class I railroads as well as the timing of purchases by East Coast railroads in the prior year quarter. Heritage aggregates pricing across the company improved 4%. This is despite the fact that the combination of reduced commercial rail shipped volumes and unfavorable product mix actually lowered the company's average selling price by $0.20 per ton.","Drilling down to more regional perspectives, continued price discipline led to heritage pricing growth of 6% for the Mid-America Group. Double-digit pricing growth in Colorado was partially offset by product mix and reduced long-haul rail shipments in Texas, resulting in an overall 3% pricing increase in the West Group. Geographic mix limited pricing growth for the Southeast Group to 2% as weather and railroad inefficiencies hindered our ability to move higher-priced aggregates product by rail into our Georgia and Florida distribution yards.","Aggregates pricing, inclusive of acquired operations, is expected to range from up 2% to up 4% for the full year. As a reminder, selling prices at legacy Bluegrass operations are 10% to 15% below our corporate average. Cement shipments and pricing increased 12% and 3%, respectively, reflecting positive demand trends in the growing Texas economy. This outlook should support future cement pricing opportunities.","Turning to our downstream businesses. Ready mixed concrete shipments increased 15%, driven primarily by construction activity in Texas, particularly in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. Overall, second quarter ready mixed concrete prices decreased slightly with lower energy sector shipments and product mix in Texas offsetting gains in Dallas-Fort Worth and the nearly 6% growth in Colorado. The combination of reduced energy sector volumes and product mix lowered our overall ready mixed concrete average selling price by $2.91 per cubic yard. We have recently communicated midyear price increases, effective October 1, in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and ancillary markets. In Colorado, project delays contribute to the 6% decrease in hot mixed asphalt shipments, while rising raw material costs allowed for favorable pricing during the quarter.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our second quarter financial results.","Jim Nickolas","Thank you, Ward.","The Building Materials business posted total products and services revenues of $1.1 billion and gross profit of $288 million, inclusive of the $42 million product revenue contribution from the acquired Bluegrass operations at adjusted margins comparable with our heritage Mid-Atlantic and Southeast operations. Overall aggregates product gross margin was 29.8%, which reflects a $10 million negative impact related to selling acquired inventory that was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding this impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 31.4%, a 150 basis point improvement.","As Ward mentioned earlier, our Cement business benefited from both strong demand and a tight supply environment. These dynamics, coupled with increased production efficiencies, led to a 680 basis point expansion of cement product gross margin to 36.5%. Magnesia Specialties second quarter products and service revenues increased to a record $68 million. Among other things, this business continues to benefit from increased global demand for magnesia chemical products as well as heightened domestic steel production. Kiln outages, both planned and unplanned, and higher petroleum coke costs contributed to a 120 basis point reduction in product gross margin to 36.5%.","Consolidated SG&A was 5.9% of total revenues, a 50 basis point improvement in part due to our realization of acquisition synergies. Earnings from operations were $264 million and include $25 million of gains from litigation and related settlements and surplus land sales. As a reminder, management previously discussed surplus land sales as part of the value proposition for our acquisition of TXI, and that's exactly what you're seeing this quarter. The disposition of surplus land is an ongoing strategy for the company. And while we cannot predict the potential timing of any future land sales, we do expect to announce additional real estate divestitures as favorable opportunities develop.","During the quarter and keeping with the company's agreement with the United States Department of Justice to resolve all competitive issues with respect to the Bluegrass transaction, we divested our heritage Forsyth aggregates quarry, north of Atlanta, Georgia, and the legacy Bluegrass Beaver Creek aggregates quarry in Western Maryland. We recognized the $15 million gain on the Forsyth quarry divestiture, which is included in acquisition-related net expenses. There was no gain or loss on the Beaver Creek divestiture.","We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation that preserves Martin Marietta's balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million for full year 2018 as we continue to prudently invest in our business. At the same time, we will continue to evaluate value-enhancing acquisition opportunities and return capital directly to shareholders. Since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015, we have returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases. In addition, given our strong cash flows as well as the desire and ability to seize the advantages of the late 2017 changes in the federal tax law, we are planning to contribute $150 million into the company's qualified defined benefit plan in the third quarter.","For the trailing 12 months ended June 2018, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the applicable credit agreement was 2.75 times, inclusive of the impact of financing the Bluegrass transaction. We expect to return to our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times by year-end.","As detailed in today's release, we increased our full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance to reflect current results, including the other operating income recognized during the second quarter. For 2018, we continue to expect consolidated total revenues to range from $4,300 million to $4,500 million, and we now expect adjusted EBITDA to reach $1,175 million to $1,295 million.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Jim.","And to reiterate, we do not see an end to the current construction recovery in the near to medium term, as years of pent-up demand provide sustainable support for an extension of steady growth. Martin Marietta is well positioned to benefit from the increasing strength of the current construction cycle. We anticipate growing demand for infrastructure projects and private sector construction activity during the second half of the year with faster growth in our key geographies due to attractive market fundamentals.","As Martin Marietta progresses towards another record year in 2018, these dynamics, coupled with our second quarter results, underscore our confidence in Martin Marietta's near and long-term growth trajectory as the construction recovery continues on a steady and extended basis. These favorable trends, together with our strong competitive position, solid balance sheet, superior assets and employees and commitment to safe and efficient operations, position Martin Marietta for continued growth, success and shareholder value creation.","If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. One of the areas that we have focused on as a firm is ongoing what's going on trends at letting state, particularly as we have influx of dollars come in that are great, but last year was a little disappointing in terms of letting. Lettings flow-through, do clearly appear to be better as we head into 2018. But importantly, I don't want to lose sight on private demand as well. So with that, could you walk through some of the key major regions and markets for Martin in terms of what you're seeing, in terms of rail demand coming forward for public and then also for private? And clarify, what is different today versus last year? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Good morning, Kathryn. Thank you for your question. Look, we agree with you. We aren't seeing a better letting schedule coming out. We anticipated that coming into the year. I think one thing that's notable as we began a broader conversation on that is we're seeing larger projects, we're seeing more complicated projects, and we're seeing more P3 work. And I think all of that is very good from our perspective because it's going to be very aggregates intensive. The only thing that I will note is, on occasion, due to the complexity of these jobs, sometimes, we have been seeing some delays just in owners getting these jobs out.","As I said in the prepared remarks, once those jobs are put forward, you know they're going to finish. So we're not concerned at all about the volume in those jobs at all. That's a broad top-side view. I think that's very helpful as we look out, not just in \u201818 but \u201819 and beyond that. Back to your question very specifically on different states, Kathryn, really as I look at our top nine states, I think there's a lot to be pretty excited about. If we look at Colorado right now, it's like ninth in job gains in the U.S. It's growing faster than most U.S. economies. The unemployment rate there is about 2.4%. It's fifth in total housing permits. So we're seeing strengthen here in both single and multifamily.","To your point, it's not just a public story right now, it's public and private. If we're looking on the public side of that, I mean, Colorado's got $1.9 billion worth of bonds for infrastructure coming up in certificates of participation. Their estimates are that it will end this year with a $1.3 billion surplus, and they've earmarked at least $650 million of those dollars for transportation in Colorado over the next couple of years. And then they're also looking at a referendum in the fall, Let's Go Colorado, to raise $2.3 billion in bonds, and that's really sales tax that would be dedicated to transportation. And what they're looking at is, is effectively raising an additional $750 million per year.","So, public and private in Colorado looks remarkably healthy. Same snapshot in Texas. I mean, Texas is ranked first in employment growth. Dallas remains first in job growth and one of the best metros in the country. Houston's at 4, showing great progress in Houston. Austin, 17; San Antonio, 25. Those gains in Houston are really important from our perspective. Unemployment there is 3.7%. So again, it's low. Texas is fourth in total housing. It's third in single-family. And part of what I moved by is still tap in multifamily. So, again, this is an economy that recovered far earlier than most, and what we're seeing is still good multifamily activity because I think it reveals the shortness in overall construction in those low-level single-family housing. The other thing that I'll say is if we look at textile, to your comment on public, $8.1 billion in lettings this year. That's up nicely from last year. And what we're anticipating is seeing about a $3.2 billion infusion from Prop 7. If we're simply looking at the backlogs that we have in different parts of the state, last year, in North Texas about $4.2 million, this year about $7.1 million. So again, if we're looking public, private, it's very healthy.","Keep in mind. We've also have those large energy projects in the Gulf that we believe are coming that have at least 22 million tons of aggregates and about 2.4 million cubic yards of ready mix. Iowa, another critical state for us, is remarkably steady. Unemployment there is about 2.2%. Remember, they raised their gas tax a couple of years ago. We think good, steady infrastructure is going to be the rule there for a while. And data center activity continues to be very strong. We've seen Microsoft, we've seen Facebook, we've seen Google there, now, we're seeing Apple coming to that marketplace with data centers. Maryland, which is an important state for us now in the aftermath of Bluegrass is sitting there with an employment rate of 3.9%. By the way, 3.9% is the highest unemployment rate in our top 9 states. I mean, 3.9% is the high watermark. I think that tells you we're in a pretty healthy place. The governor there has unveiled 15 preliminary options on Capital Beltway and Interstate 270, and he's looking at a proposed $9 billion project to widen much of that interstate as well. In Florida, again, it's mostly about infrastructure for us, and we're seeing a very strong DOT program that's very consistent with last year's record program. What's important for us in Florida is CSX rail is getting better. What you've heard us say on the last several calls is that's been a bit of a bottleneck for us. Norfolk Southern has had some short-term issues there, but again, we're seeing much better work out of CSX right now.","If we're looking at Georgia, the state is seventh overall in job growth, so is Atlanta, 3.5% unemployment. It's eighth in single-family housing permits. And part of what's happening too is you're seeing so much more activity because of court activity there. The DOT has proposed the nation's first all-truck highway. I think that gives you a good sense of how important states like Georgia are seeing moving trucks more quickly and more safely to amp up their competitiveness. We talked about the fact that South Carolina has eventually raised their gas tax. For the first time in a long time, they're putting $0.12 over 6 years. That's been one of our healthiest markets.","And perhaps most importantly, here in our home state in North Carolina, we're seeing much, much better activity. It's top 6 in employment growth, top three in housing permits growth, a much improved DOT outlook, it's fifth in employment. Charlotte is 19th, North Carolina unemployment rate is 3.7%. It's second in residential permits. So what we're seeing here on the private side is attractive, but here's what's important. We're seeing good public work that's coming as well. NCDOT is spending down its cash balance very, very quickly. Build NC is a process that went successfully through our legislature. It's going to basically add $300 million a year for 10 years on bonds. So again, as we look at our top 8, 9 states, Kathryn, both on public and on private, we like the snapshot that we're seeing overall. I know that was a long answer, but I thought your question was a good one. I wanted to take a little bit of time to talk through those.","Kathryn Thompson","Sure, and that's helpful. And a my follow-up question, and then I'll get back into the queue, is really about the forward look. You raised guidance on EBITDA. But can you give more color on the drivers for the upped guidance, including to what extent have you factored in headwinds that are facing this market, including tight labor, rail, as you noted in your prepared commentary and your response. The other just basic transportation on roads logistics. So how have you -- how much have you factored those headwinds given the visibility you have with volumes?","Ward Nye","Thank you, Kathryn. I guess, a couple of things. When we came into the year, we actually said there are going to be several swing factors. There will be headwinds to your point. We said labor tightness would be one of them. We said there's always a prospect of atypical weather. You're always looking at Class I rail performance-wise truck shortages and just macro issues. So I think it's fair to say we have come out exactly where we thought frankly better in the first half of the year with a number of those headwinds there. We actually think the rail situation is getting modestly better. So as we look at second half, several things. One, I would say that last year, you recall, we had 2 major hurricanes that hit us in Texas, Georgia and in Florida. So from a comp perspective, it should get easier as we go into the second half. The other thing that I would tell you is we don't have a labor issue in Martin Marietta.","The issue that we're faced with is clearly we have the ability to put all the stone on the ground that contractors could meet. The issue is going to be whether contractors can take that stone from our quarries or sales yards and get them to their jobs. We think that's going to start to ease moderately in the second half of the year. And as we look at the outlook, we think the underlying demand is there. We think logistics are getting better. Our contractors have significant backlogs. The more public work we have, the more liquidated damages contractors are going to have if they can't finish that work on time, and we think that's part of what comes back and starts to address the labor constraints that we're seeing. So I hope that helps respond to the second part of your question, Kathryn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies.","Phil Ng","Can you talk a little bit more about pricing in aggregates and cement? Is there an opportunity to go for a second increase in the back half of the year in select markets, just because things are pretty tight in these markets? Or is it just more of a 2019 event?","Ward Nye","What I think, Phil, the answer is both. I think the answer is there's going to be some areas that you'll see some price increases in the back half of the year and some that it's going to be more for next year. So if we think about it, here's the way I would bifurcate it for you. Let's talk about cement first because, as you recall, we had an April 6 price increase in cement, primarily in North Texas and in Houston. Right now we have spoken to our customers about a $6 a ton increase in October in cement, so that's obviously an ongoing dialogue. The other thing that I would say is we're looking at ready mixed concrete. We're also done about ready mixed concrete price increases as we get here toward the back half of the year as well. So we're looking at $6 a cubic yard price increases, effective in North Texas and Central Texas.","So again, you\u2019re going to that part of the market that I think you've addressed where you're seeing some tightness, particularly in cement, I think that's what we're seeing. I think relative to aggregates, here's part of what's interesting, Phil. If we really go and take a look at the aggregate pricing and look at it very appropriately stripping out product mix and geographic mix, part of what's interesting to us is if you do same-on-same pricing for the overall company, this quarter would have been up 5.9%. So again, we tried to call out what some of the issues were relative to geographic mix because of some of the difficulties with Class I railroads in the Southeast in particular and in the West. And if we look at that, that's certainly affected the optics of pricing growth there. And we talked about some product mix issues, particularly in the West that affected that as well. So if we come back and say, are we looking for price raises in cement and ready mix in select markets in the second half of this year? Yes. Are we pleased with the overall pricing that we're seeing in aggregates as we hit here at half year? Yes. And is that very much in keeping with the type of metrics that we've discussed over the last several years and where we thought we would see the pricing going? I think the answer on that continues to be yes as well.","Phil Ng","Got it. Two questions on that front, I guess. On the mix side of things, I know it's been kind of the headwind for last few quarters. Part of that is the storms and maybe using less clean stone for some of these bigger projects early on. Do we kind of see that mix headwind kind of reverse in the back half or it's going to take a little more time? And then the second question I had on pricing was on cement. Just given the tightness of the market, I would've thought cement pricing would have been firmer for April, but while it is up but not as much as I think some people would have expected, so just curious to get some thoughts on that?","Ward Nye","Okay. With respect to both of those, I do think some of the geographic mix issues will get better as rail service gets better. So, the more product we see moving into South Texas and the more product that we see going into Florida and South Georgia, that will help pretty considerably. I think the other thing as these larger projects become more mature, you're going to see more clean stone go into those. So I do think over time, that that's going to tend to adjust itself. But I agree with you on cement by the way. That's a tight cement market in Texas. I don't see anything that makes this thing it's not going to be at tight cement market. Obviously, it's a very valuable product, and it's one of the reasons that we're looking for a $6 increase in October. So we will see how that goes, Phil.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Ward, can you just give us a rough sense of the rail issues? How much they cost you in terms of shipment volumes in the quarter? And you mentioned you're seeing signs of improvement? Can you just give us a bit more context because the 12x for the rails at least in aggregate still looked challenging, but hopefully it's better in your parts of the footprint than what we see reported?","Ward Nye","Two different ways I want to encourage to think about this, Jerry. Number one, the railroads are very good customers of ours; and number two, the railroads are vendors of ours. So we have a bifurcated relationship. On the customer side, they're buying typically ballast from us. We're the largest ballast supplier in the United States. So if we look at ballast purchases for the quarter, they were down about 300,000 tons. And the fact is I think ballast is probably about as low as ballast can get. So I think we feel like there's probably upside on ballast. But for the quarter, that was that 300,000 tons.","On the other side of the coin is the commercial work that we do with them. In other words, when the railroads are coming into our quarries, picking up our stone and taking our stone to a sales yard, then we will subsequently sell to a contractor or others. If I break that down between those two geographies, I was just talking with Phil about in the previous question, if I look at what was going on in Texas, number one, and what was going on the Southeast, number two, what I would say is we probably had deferred shipments in Texas all by itself, but modestly over 400,000 tons. If we take a look at what the snapshot look like in the Southeast, it was probably 250,000 tons. So take your full vision of both the ballast and the commercial side, let those 2 things fuse together, and you've got just about 1 million tons of stone that's most likely defer relative to rail in the second quarter. If we had put that back into the volume that we've reported for you, volume actually for the quarter would've been up 5.7%. So to the extent it come back to the essence of your question, do we believe that rail is getting better, particularly for CSX? The answer is yes, we do.","Do we see better performance out of Union Pacific? Yes, we do. Are those 2 things important to us and perhaps disproportionately going forward? They are. So do we think they're going to be varying degrees of rail conversations, it will likely occur throughout the rest of the year. I think the answer to that candidly is yes. Do we think it's going to be largely mitigated as we go into the second half? I think the answer to that is yes as well.","Jerry Revich","Okay, very helpful context. And if you look at the high end of your volume guidance, 6% heritage aggregates growth and based on the year-to-date results of flat to down 1%, to hit the high end, we're looking at, call it, 13% heritage volume growth in 3Q and 4Q. Can you just talk about how feasible is that? What was the cadence of demand over the course of the quarter because it feels like a lot has to go right to hit the high end of that volume range. So any context there would be helpful.","Ward Nye","Look, I think to hit the high end of the volume range, I think you're right. And I don't think it's an issue of demand, Jerry. I think it's an issue of can contractors take it. To hit that 4% to 6%, to hit the low end of the range, let\u2019s spend other minute [ph] and then talk about that, basically what we're saying is heritage shipments to the back half must increase over 9% of the prior year period. And the thing to keep in mind is in Q3 2017, we had shipments that were pretty negatively impacted by a record precipitation then including those 2 significant hurricanes that came into both, Texas as well as Florida and Georgia. So if we look at a normal cadence quarter-by-quarter on what aggregates look like, I mean, this is what I would tell you. 13 to 17 snapshots, Q1 is typically 18% volume, Q2 typically 27%, Q3 is usually 30%, and Q4 is usually 25%. In other words, I think people who ordinarily might be surprised to know that Q4 at a typical year is as impactful as Q2. So again, as we look at the balance of the year, you're talking about high end of the range. I'm talking about the lower end of the range. Either way, I think those are your puts and takes, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Okay. That's helpful. And Ward, from a cadence standpoint, can you just talk about how demand stacked up over the course of the quarter? And you mentioned super easy comps in the third quarter. Can you just give us a sense for how shipping rates look in July, just to build our comfort that the easy comps are playing out in terms of that significant volume growth?","Ward Nye","Jerry, as you know, I never talk about the month of the quarter that we're in. So I'll talk about July when we'll circle back and talk to you in November. If we're looking at the way that the quarter itself went, April was up 8%, May was up 4%, June got hit with some rain and fewer shipping days, and June was modestly off 1%. So that was the build as we went into the quarter, Jerry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","I'm just wondering if you could about incremental margins and the outlook in the second half of the year? Understanding that some of the rail inefficiencies might start to ease. But any color on other cost items that might be moving around and could benefit you in the second half in order for you to get to your incremental margin targets for the full year will be helpful.","Ward Nye","Yes. I'll comment that the incrementals, at least for where we are in the year has been right about where we thought that they would be given our guidance. A couple of things that I'll speak to you. But, I'll ask Jim to speak to it more specifically. And clearly, we have had some higher cost per ton issues, most likely related to energy and some higher equipment rentals as well because we are anticipating greater volumes in different parts of the country, and we've talked about those different parts of the country, particularly in the east that we think are recovering but that's at least some top side comments. Let me turn it over to Jim to let him respond to you more clearly.","Jim Nickolas","Yes. So, it's a couple of things. You've got -- we've got implied second half implied gross margins are better than first half actuals better than second quarter. But we're confident these are within our ability to achieve them. We expected the higher diesel costs. Those are there. We're seeing that coming through, but we expected it. But as you look at it in a percentage versus last year, I mean, that hurts from an incremental perspective, if you're comparing second half of '17 to second half of '18, the higher diesel costs have an outsized impact just because of the short time from you're looking at. So I think a better way of looking at it is, second half implied gross margins, and those are, again, something we're looking it's going to be achievable based on the volume and the ASP growth we're expecting. So, it's really not much of a stretch. The one issue that we had in the second quarter, it\u2019s not really an issue, but it's incremental comparison point is that the shipments versus production of aggregates in Q2 were in line. Prior year Q2, we produced 2 million more than we shipped. So, that's a headwind that we have absorbed in Q2. And despite that, we have higher gross margins in Q2. We think we're going to be able to offset the same dynamic in the second half of the year as well. So I hope that answers the question appropriately for you, but it's sort of implied gross margins are improving, but we think it's achievable.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Great to know. That's helpful. Just wanted to follow-up. You provide a lot of color on your infrastructure outlook in a lot of the states. You're not in California, but I just wondered if you could provide a perspective on just the SP1 repeal efforts. Is there any risk that repeal efforts could bleed into some of your markets, given gas tax increases have been core to driving funding increases on the infrastructure side and a lot of places that you service?","Ward Nye","Garik, it's perfectly fair question. I just don't see any underlying effort or notion in these states to do it. I think part of what's happening is if we look at places like South Carolina, I think South Carolina, historically, is about as anti-tax as any place could be. But they're focused on competitiveness, and they understand that they have to make this move if they want to keep bringing people in like Boeing, Continental Tire, BMW and others. Indiana, again, had raised their tax by $0.10 per gallon. Part of what I'm taken with in many of these states, Gary, and this is part of what's different, these are red states. These tend to be broadly Republican states that have done this. And what I would say is if you're seeing gas tax raised in Republican states typically by Republican governors and Republican legislatures, that's a very different conversation than the one that we see and hear going on in California right now. I certainly hope for the sake of the industry that we don't see that type of action undertake in the California, but I do not see any type of movement in that as I look at these big 9 states that are most important to us.","Garik Shmois","And then just a last question just on asphalt, not a big part of your business. But any rule of thumb of how quickly you can recover asphalt margins in the face of higher liquid asphalt inflation?","Ward Nye","I'll answer it in part this way. If you look at our year-to-date shipments in revenue, they're behind plan by 2.7% and 7.2%. But our year-to-date performance is actually better than planned. And what I'd tell you is most of these jobs are indexed. So you're able to keep up with it relatively well. I mean, to your point, clearly, liquid asphalt is up. And then Q2 unit cost was up about 6.6%. So if we're looking at liquid today at about $377 per ton, that's up $23 or about 6.6% over the prior year. But at the same time, we're looking at a business in Colorado that we think is going to be incredibly attractive. The only issue that we have with our asphalt and paving business in Colorado was last year, it's just so darn good. We're just wondering if this year can be better. But everything that we see in Colorado and that business is attractive, and we think we'll make up for that costs really in the back half of the year. It's an odd business because really, this is the time of year when you really start making your money. And we have a very good outlook for that business for the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rohit Seth of SunTrust.","Rohit Seth","I got a question on these transportation issues. When -- you have capacity constraints on the rail, and you can't get materials to the projects. Do these projects get delayed because of material availability? Or do they just switch suppliers?","Ward Nye","Well, again, the issue is not us. It's not that we don't have the ability. Keep in mind, most of what we're shipping is being still at FOB at our location. So really, in most instances, the contractor has the burden on them to come to our quarry and take it there. We also think, in most circumstances, we're locationally advantaged. So as a practical matter, what tends to happen in a lot of these jobs, is they simply become extended jobs. I think it's tougher for contractors if they're in a circumstance they're faced with liquidated damages, and that, that was what I was referencing before. So for example, there's some very large projects right now underway at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. Some of those jobs are running behind schedule. At the same time, they're very large LDs on those jobs, not for us, but for contractors if they don't finish on time. We have the material. We have it in spec. We have it on our yards. We have it ready for them. So from our perspective, it's really not so much whether somebody's going to change suppliers because we have what they need. The issue, I think, is going to be, at times, more of an economic issue for the contractor to deal with throughput. And oftentimes, as I said in my prepared remarks, what that may mean is paying more for trucking going forward than you have historically.","Rohit Seth","Okay. And then just on your pricing, year-to-date, you're trending toward the lower end of your guidance range. With North Carolina coming back, I mean it is -- or accelerating, I should say, was that part of your expectation coming into the year? And how do you see your pricing trending as the year progresses?","Ward Nye","Well, again, the more we see, the Mid-Atlantic volumes grow. And the more we see the Southeast grow and the more you see Florida grow, optically and otherwise, that's going to help considerably on ASPs. I think one thing that's worth remembering is if we go back and simply have that discussion that I had just a couple of questions ago, removing product mix and geographic mix, then ASPs would be sitting for the quarter up 5.9%. So I guess, where I'm sitting here, if we're talking about pricing in this environment of under that scenario, close to 6%, that's certainly not disappointing to me. And if to your point, places like the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida are getting healthier, and by the way, I think they are, I think that actually makes what is already a very good pricing story, even better.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schrier of Citi.","Scott Schrier","Following up on Jerry's question before, but I think more broadly speaking, and I know you have these easy comps in the back half of the year. But you talk about unemployment rates being so low in a lot of your states, which of course, is a positive. But do you see these labor constraints that we have starting to cap or limit how much you can ship in a quarter? Are there any risk that we might be close to any kind of peak amount of shipments that the market can absorb and things will just be more protracted? If we look at where shipment expectations are in your guide for '18 and assuming folks are looking for mid-single digits in '19, I'm not looking for guidance, but just thinking about kind of the market, is there enough labor to get, say, somewhere around 185 million tons or whatever it may be?","Ward Nye","I think, there's going to be enough labor to do it. I think the wage structure in some places may have to pivot a little bit. And again, I think, to the extent that you're seeing increasing public work that's going to have tighter deadlines, that's going to have tighter specifications and that's going to have more liquidated damage provisions attached to them, my guess is you will simply see of necessity more labor coming into the construction market. But again, the other part of your question I want to make sure that we address it, I don't want people to think of peak in the wrong way. I don't think we're getting anywhere near peak in what's going on relative to volume, certainly not relative to requirements for volume.","Again, I think if you go back to the commentary that we put out this morning in the writing, the CEO commentary, you saw our view that this is going to be a continued nice, steady climb. My view is probably for several years. But again, I think, the more public work you see coming in, and I think that's what we're likely to see over the next several years, I think the more you will see labor coming into contracting and labor coming into trucking. It's a perfectly fair statement to say that we have very large contractors in North Carolina right now who would say, on any given day, the market is 10% short of trucks. That's a nice opportunity for somebody, and I'm relatively sure they're going to fill that hole.","Scott Schrier","Great. And then on the ready mixed piece, you had some mix issues that impact Texas. You called out solid pricing in the DFW. I'm curious, on a like-for-like basis, excluding the energy projects, is Houston challenging from a ready mixed price perspective? And overall, just looking at ready mixed, margins weren't bad, of course we're seeing a little bit of compression. Is that mostly due to the labor and diesel? Or are there some impacts from the material spread as well?","Ward Nye","Well, I guess, two -- first things first. We don't actually have a ready mixed business in Houston. So if we look at where we are in Texas, it tends to be more of a central to North Texas business than. We have some in South Texas but not in Houston. If you're looking at just the price increases themselves, we saw Rocky Mountain up 5.9%, we saw the northeast portion outside of the metroplex up about 4%. We saw the metroplex itself up about -- excuse me, about 2.2%. Part of the challenge is, you're looking at most of those markets that are going to be, at least in Texas, somewhere in the mid-90s to low teens in dollars per cubic yard. What happened is when you pull out some of that energy work that we had last year and you're selling concrete for numbers that are much higher than those because, again, it's those large LNG or other projects that we feel like the second wave is really heading our way for more bidding this year and more activity next year. That's more your issue than anything else. Is diesel fuel an issue in that? You bet it is. So that's clearly going to give you some degree of compression. But if you're looking at what's happening relative to price, and keeping in mind, again, we're looking for $6 cubic yard price increase in North and Central Texas effective October 1, it gives you a sense of what's happening in those markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis.","Adam Thalhimer","Ward, can you talk a little bit -- I know it's early, but just your early thoughts on 2019 aggregates pricing?","Ward Nye","I guess the primary metric that you've heard me say for a long time, Adam, is look at what volumes are and then take a look at pricing. And part of what you've heard me say is if volumes are growing at a tepid rate, then you can look back at a more historical rate of pricing. If volume start rising at a 5%-or-more, then watching pricing and volume link up together, perhaps at times, that pricing having a bit of a lag, on a percentage basis, is not a bad way to think of it. That's what we said historically. I will clearly say that we have been outperforming that metric for the last several years. So I may have to come back and revisit the way that I've looked at that. Look, there's a lot of demand ahead of us in '18. I think that pushes a lot of demand and continued new growth in '19. We've talked about some tightness in places like Texas on cement mill. I think all of that conversation is actually very constructive for what we'll continue to be in this industry, in aggregates, in particular, a very attractive pricing market going forward. So I've done everything except give you percentages for next year, which, at some point, I will do. I just won't do it today. But I suppose what I'm saying, I don't see anything that makes us feel like that's going to be unattractive at all.","Adam Thalhimer","Understood. And then, I wanted to ask about an infrastructure bill. Are you guys anymore optimistic that maybe the sentiments improving for a gas tax increase and actually getting something through?","Ward Nye","It was interesting to see what Chairman Shuster did earlier this week, right? I mean, clearly as this Bill Shuster comes out of office, and of course, he's going to retire in January, he really laid out a plan that he knows is not going to be something that he's going to see happen just before he goes. But if you look at the plan that he rolled out here on the 23rd of July, he set out a couple of things: one, it's a plan that provides an additional $123 billion over 10 years and funded by $0.15 gas tax increase and a $0.20 diesel tax increase phased in over 3 years beginning in 2019. Now what he's also done is he's build a framework around because his view, I think, is everyone's view, and that is gas tax and diesel taxes over the long term are not the sustainable way to pay for infrastructure. So if we're looking at it, what we're seeing continuing to evolve and state levels, if we're looking at the way North Carolina or Georgia or Indiana or Iowa or Texas are paying for it, I think the simple fact is, you will likely see continued debate in Congress around the way to make sure they have good funding for this going forward.","There is some talk that maybe we'll see some activity in lame duck. We've clearly seen that happen before. My personal guess is that you will not see that happen in lame duck because I think there's going to be a more robust debate around that. But again, I don't have individual conversations with Congressmen or Senators who don't get this. I don't have conversations in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that are not very supportive of this. We don't have conversations with the American Trucking Association, who are not supportive of this. So my view is, yes, we will see it. I think it's hard to nail down exactly what the timing is going to be, but I actually thought what Chairman Shuster did this week was a very constructive step in fashioning the debate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens.","Trey Grooms","Just kind of touching back on the geographic mix, I know what's impacting pricing, as you mentioned. And then you called out some improvements in North Carolina. And as you mentioned earlier, it does have higher prices, and I understand higher incrementals as well. The incremental margins that are embedded in the guidance for aggregates, in that it still seems like maybe a less favorable geographic mix is still kind of being implied there? I'm just trying to put what you're saying about North Carolina with what's embedded in the guide for the incrementals and aggregates, and just understanding the puts and takes there. And where\u2026","Ward Nye","Now, here's the way that I would encourage you to think about it. I think we think half 2 in Colorado is going to be a very impressive half 2. I think we think half 2 in Texas may be a very impressive half 2. And I think when you're having that type of half 2 in parts of the West, that is going to have an effect to a degree on incrementals. I think in part of what we're seeing in North Carolina is we're seeing good activity, but it's good activity that's building for even better activity going forward. The other component of it that I would bring you back to as well though is what's going on relative to energy in some of those markets. Because that's clearly going to, at least in the near term, have an impact on some of the incrementals. But I'll turn it over to Jim to see if he has any other comments that he'd like to offer on that as well, Trey.","Jim Nickolas","So I think, the fundamental building blocks are there. Again, incrementals are comparing versus the prior year. We have the higher volumes coming through. We have the higher pricing coming through. And assuming whether it's normal, all those things should work in our favor. So yes, second half gross profit is higher than first half. But that is not a stretch. So we think that's going to work, again, the fundamental building blocks in place volume and ASP coming through.","Trey Grooms","Got it, okay. And then if we were to just kind of dust off some comments from the past, given some of the changes that have taken place with freight and cost and some of the things you've mentioned, if we get back to a more normal kind of geographic mix, historically, we've been looking forward had talked about this, kind of this incremental margin in the 60% range. Is that -- given the backdrop of the changes that we've seen, is that still kind of the bogey with a more normal geographic mix or has that outlook changed at all?","Ward Nye","Look, Trey, that\u2019s totally fancy [ph] outlook. And I think the key to that outlook is going back to what you just said. If we had continued economic emergence in the North Carolinas, South Carolinas, Georgias and Floridas of the world, that's where we're going.","Trey Grooms","Got it. And then I've just got a couple for clarity here. One is, just to make sure I heard right, Ward. The $10 million that was -- that you guys realized in the quarter from the inventory markup, I believe in the guide, it said $20 million. When is the timing of the rest of that coming through?","Jim Nickolas","That will be coming through in Q3.","Trey Grooms","Okay. So adjust that. Okay. Another housekeeping is the acquisition done in June, I know it's probably not going to move the needle too much. But, did that add to volume or any other metrics as you look\u2026","Ward Nye","It's going to be really very modestly. You're talking about a couple of sites in the Midwest and we're talking about at approximately I want to say 1.2 million tons per annum. So, it\u2019s -- Trey, it's nothing that I think is going to rock your model.","Trey Grooms","Got it. And last one is just another for clarity. Your comment on aggregate, same on same, 5.9% on pricing. Just to be clear, was that comment for heritage? So 5.9% versus the 4.4%? Or was that for the overall?","Ward Nye","Yes. Thanks for the clarification. Yes, that was heritage, correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel.","Stanley Elliott","Ward, what are the -- in the release this morning, you talked about the public being 40% of volumes kind of year-to-date. How quickly can that normalize? And is that really going to be more a function of public accelerating meaningfully? Or is that kind of taking into account the private piece slowed? I mean, how do we think about that dynamic, one. And then two, what does that do? I mean, you talked a little bit about regional impact in terms of mix. What is having a healthier public market do in terms of ASPs, mix, et cetera?","Ward Nye","Just a couple of things. One, I think it does reveal more than acceleration on the public side. Because we don't see a pullback in the private and in the markets in which we are operating. So if we're looking -- go back to the comments that we made last year as we wrapped up 2017. I think to the extent that people were surprised that volumes were down last year, we said, look, the issue simply this, public never showed up at the party. And I think what's happened this year's public is starting to make an appearance, but there's a much bigger appearance that they still have do make. And I think one of the things that's worth remembering on that is I did spend some time talking to those top 8 or 9 states, and what I'm trying to focus on as I was going through those was really what we see going on in the Colorado, and in Texas, and in Iowa, and the Maryland, and the Florida, and a Georgia, and South Carolina and North Carolina, all on public. And what we're seeing in those states over the last 18 to 24 months has been an effort to put much more consideration to that public sector. So I think, from where we're sitting, we think we should see a nice ramp up of that, and I don't think we're going to feel the negative from what's going on relative to the private either. I think, if we had a footprint that was not as Southeast and Southwest-driven, I feel modestly different about it. But again, so I'm looking at the footprint that we have from a private perspective, I feel really good. If I look at the footprint we have from a public perspective, I feel increasingly good.","Operator","And your next question comes from Craig Bibb of CJS. Your line is open.","Craig Bibb","I am going to focus on price too. You had flat price and ready mix with volume up 15%, which seems like kind of gross, [ph] but now, it\u2019s was because of a geographic mix change to lower priced markets and then market mix change away from energy. Putting through a price increase in October, so we're looking for flat price again in Q3 or what am I missing there?","Ward Nye","Yes. I guess, what we're saying is you just need to look and see where it is. If you're looking really looking at the ready mix business, what you want to look at from a Martin Marietta perspective, and you want to understand pricing is I want to encourage you to care about what's going on in Denver, and I would encourage you to care about what's going on in Dallas-Fort Worth. And then to the extent that you get gravy in that Southeast corner of Texas when there's energy activity, then that's really what it is. So if you're looking at pricing, and I say, look, it's up almost 6% in the Rockies, it's up 4% in that Northeast sector going out of the metroplex, and it's up 2.2% in Dallas, those really aren't disappointing numbers in my view, particularly if we're successful coming back in getting this price increase as we look at fall.","Craig Bibb","Okay. And then -- actually, the 2.2% in Dallas, I think that's where the bulk of your ready mix assets are?","Ward Nye","It is.","Craig Bibb","And that's a really strong market, so why only 2.2%?","Ward Nye","It's also -- you're right, it's a strong market, and it's a big market. And it's a market that has a lot of players, Craig.","Craig Bibb","So it's more price competitive then it's reasonable, given the strength of that?","Ward Nye","It's got a lot of players.","Craig Bibb","Okay. And then cement actually -- essentially that same question. I mean you guys have -- your pricing is kind of lagged with what you would've preferred for a little while now. And now the market's finally tight, and you're looking for $6 per ton in October. I'm sure you'd rather have $10 or $12, so what's holding it back?","Ward Nye","Well, we put on a $6 per ton price increase in October, and we're talking to our customers about it right now, Craig. So my intention is we'll come back and talk you all about that when we have our conversation in November. But we're just looking to see how the market accepts that.","Craig Bibb","Okay. And then last one on Magnesia Specialties, your margins were hit by kiln outage. Is that all behind you, and we return to normal margin or maybe a little better in the second half?","Ward Nye","No, I guess part of what I'm saying is 36.5% isn't a bad margin. So I'll take that every day. So maybe the primary things that you saw there is you saw some repairs in supply and contract services up about $2.2 million, about 12%. We had some planned and unplanned repairs to a rotary kiln and a silo and a clarifier. I think those issues are largely behind us. I think we anticipate a nice year for the rest of the year there. One thing that's worth noting is year-to-date capacity utilizations, steel is 76.3%, so that's up almost 3% from the 74.4% where it was in the prior year period. So again, as we look at the overall health of that business and the margins at 36.5%, there's just nothing to apologize for there. That's a very impressive performance.","Operator","And I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.","Ward Nye","Think you again for joining our second quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed on slide two, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially.","Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","In addition, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information, which is also available on our website and in our SEC filings.","As we announced in this morning's release, we achieved second quarter records for consolidated net sales, gross profit, earnings from operations and earnings per diluted share. These results demonstrate our team's ability to deliver strong financial performance, despite the impact of weather and other uncontrollable headwinds.","Importantly, in the first half of 2017, our record performance included our team delivering the best total injury incident rate in our company's history, the product of our foundational focus on safety and operational excellence. During the second quarter, we announced an agreement to acquire Bluegrass Materials Company, the largest privately-held, pure-play aggregates business in the United States. Those of you who have heard us talk very publicly about SOAR, an acronym for our strategic operating analysis and review process, were likely not surprised when you read the Bluegrass announcement.","This acquisition directly aligns with our strategic growth plan and complements our existing pure-play aggregates positions in the eastern United States by adding 23 additional operations with more than 2 billion tons of high-quality reserves. Bluegrass' Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee operations complement Martin Marietta's existing southeastern footprint and expand our product offerings to new and existing customers. Bluegrass' Maryland facilities supply customers in the Baltimore, Frederick, Hagerstown, Maryland Eastern Shore Metropolitan areas, as well as Delaware and will serve as a valuable strategic platform for additional growth.","Further, this transaction provides leading positions in Bowling Green and eastern Kentucky. Currently, aggregate shipments in all of these geographies are 20% to 30% below prior peak levels, but are expected to benefit from accelerating economic growth in the eastern United States. Bluegrass' strong earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization or EBITDA margins, talented workforce and dedication to safety aligned with those of our existing Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic operations, which should lead to a seamless successful integration.","We will access the capital market to finance this transaction and are committed to returning to our target debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 to 2.5 times within 12 to 18 months following the transaction's closing, which we currently expect in the fourth quarter of 2017 following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We look forward to welcoming the Bluegrass team to Martin Marietta.","Now let's turn to the company's second quarter performance. We delivered the following record results: consolidated net sales of $996 million, consolidated gross profit of $274 million, earnings from operations of $213 million, EBITDA of $292 million, and earnings per diluted share of $2.25.","Operating cash flow for the six months ended June 30 was $230 million, increasing 9% over the comparable prior-year period and exceeding the first half 2017 peak operating cash flow by more than $70 million. These second quarter records highlight our ability to drive both top and bottom line growth in a period of modest but steady expansion in construction activity as well as our ability to perform well, despite short-term basically weather-related challenges in our historically most profitable regions.","With that, let's discuss the biggest drivers of our second quarter performance. We benefited from continued residential growth and expect further gains in both single and multi-family construction in most of our top metropolitan areas. As expected, we're seeing a higher share of more aggregates-intensive single-family construction. Non-residential volumes in the second quarter were led by light non-residential building, as we continue to anticipate the next phase of heavy energy sector activity to start in late 2017 and early 2018.","Infrastructure was steady during the quarter, with weather related delays pushing back project timetables; importantly, new large scale infrastructure construction activity is the most sensitive to weather impacts due to stringent department of transpiration construction standards.","Notwithstanding these delays, we remain resolute that state and local initiatives combined with the potential for future increases in federal funding would generate significantly higher demand as the nation begins to address decades of under investment and we anticipate, weather permitting, a busy second half of 2017.","As we've discussed many times, inclement weather can have a meaningful impact on construction activity in any given quarter. That's why it makes sense to analyze our industry over durations longer than three months, such as a half, a full year or more. That's indeed how we model and operate our business and our outlook remains positive based on the demand needs of our customers.","And while they too struggle with periods of unfavorable weather sporadically compounded by capacity constraints and tight labor markets, our customers are broadly upbeat about both their short- and medium-term outlooks.","Further, slow, steady growth reinforces the durable recovery with signs of continued growth evident in the vast majority of Martin Marietta areas. The broad-based underlying strength of our building materials business is revealed by volume and pricing increases across all product lines. Aggregates product line shipments increased 2% despite the negative impact of weather and other uncontrollable headwinds. The West Group led the growth with 3.6% improvement driven by demand in Colorado and Central Texas.","The Mid-America Group's volume improvement of 2% was hindered by record rainfall. The Southeast Group and Georgia in particular was most impacted by heavy precipitation leading to a volume decline of 3%. Atlanta's second quarter rainfall more than doubled in comparison with the prior year's quarter and was 64% above the 30-year average.","Importantly, on days not impacted by precipitation, our shipments typically exceeded that district's three-year average. Our cement shipments increased 8% led by strength in the Dallas\/Fort Worth region. The ready-mixed concrete business delivered an 11.5% increase in shipments inclusive of volumes from an acquired business. The asphalt product line benefited from continued vigorous demand in Colorado and delivered impressive volume growth of 16.5%.","Our pricing growth includes an overall aggregates product line average selling price increase of nearly 4% with growth of 10.6% in our Southeast Group driven by strong Florida demand. The West Group and Mid-America Group delivered increases of 3.4% and 2.4% respectively. Notably, Mid-America Group pricing growth was reduced by 200 basis points through opportune sales of lower priced fill material in the quarter.","The cement business, benefiting from improved market fundamentals, delivered a 5.2% increase in average selling price. Ready-mixed concrete pricing increased 1.4% in the second quarter, in line with our expectations, primarily due to geographic mix and lower energy project activity. Our local prices generally increased in the mid-single digits in Texas.","Finally, our asphalt product line reported a pricing gain of 11% for the quarter. Collectively, our Building Materials business generated a record second quarter gross profit of $250 million. Consistent with the net sales impact from significant rainfall, production costs were negatively affected as well with increased expenses required to return our facilities to normal, safe operating conditions. The significant precipitation experienced in the eastern United States throughout much of the quarter is illustrated on the weather maps on slide five.","As mentioned, our historically most profitable regions including North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, each endured near record levels of rainfall. Given anticipated robust second-half demand, we accelerated grading, performed equipment maintenance and repair, and increased production where possible.","For the second quarter, the cement product line incurred $3.5 million of kiln maintenance costs. Overall, the Building Materials business achieved a gross margin of 26.8%, up 30 basis points and led by the Southeast Group which delivered a nearly 250-basis-point expansion over the prior-year quarter, driven by pricing growth and disciplined cost control in the face of terrible weather.","The Magnesia Specialties business also delivered a record second quarter. Net sales of $65 million, an increase of nearly 10% compared with the prior quarter, reflects growth in both the chemicals and lime product lines. The business' gross margin of 36.6% benefited from higher steel utilization, partially offset by planned maintenance expenses that did not occur in the prior-year period.","Disruptive weather, while uncontrollable, is typically a short-term impact and does not normally alter overall market demand. We remain optimistic in the strong multiyear outlook for the construction sector generally and Martin Marietta specifically. This optimism is fueled by the strength and sustainability of job growth in our key metropolitan areas, an important catalyst for construction activity in all major end uses: residential, non-residential and infrastructure.","Texas ranked first, Florida third, Georgia fifth, North Carolina eighth, and Colorado ninth in overall job growth for the trailing 12 months ended May 2017. Importantly, employment growth in most of these key geographies is accelerating faster than the United States average. Overall, the United States added 2.2 million jobs during the trailing 12 months, and positive employment data for our top states further solidifies our outlook for the second half of 2017 and beyond.","As noted earlier, private construction activity led our growth for the second quarter. The residential market, which accounted for 20% of our second quarter aggregates product line shipments, is benefiting from continued economic recovery, particularly in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, and Iowa, which are all ranked in the top 10 states for total housing permits, and indicate our future demand. We're also encouraged by increasing levels of single-family housing permits, with Dallas, Tampa, Austin, Atlanta, Orlando, Charlotte, Houston, and Raleigh comprising the top eight performers nationally. Yet national housing starts remain below the 50-year historical average of 1.5 million per annum. By its nature, single-family housing and related subdivision development activity are considerably more aggregates intensive than multi-family construction. While some national multi-family trends are mixed, we see solid multi-family activity in many of our top metropolitan areas and anticipate further growth.","We continue to observe encouraging trends in non-residential construction demand. North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, and Colorado are benefiting from positive private sector activity, including large corporate relocations and healthy residential construction. Additionally, the June 2017 Dodge Momentum Index reading of 141.1, near its highest level since 2009 and steadily increasing since mid-2016, signals further non-residential growth with a strong commercial building outlook.","Turning to infrastructure, weather-induced project delays combined with labor shortages translated into flat volumes in the second quarter. We anticipate volume gains in the second half of the year, as our customers have indicated solid backlogs and the desire to make progress on delayed jobs. We remain steadfast in our belief that the benefits of federal, state, and local funding increases, including those in the $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act, will have positive impacts on infrastructure construction activity in the second half of the year and beyond.","Critically important examples of these state and local led initiatives include the record Florida Department of Transportation current year budget of nearly $11 billion; the emerging impact of Georgia State House Bill 170, which is expected to double its state-level transportation construction investment; the Colorado Springs local 2C sales tax initiatives, which adds tens of millions of dollars of infrastructure investment in that community; and gas tax increases in Iowa, South Carolina, and Indiana.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2017 and beyond, we see our most profitable outlook ever underpinned by employment gains in our top markets. We expect increased levels of construction activity across our three primary end uses, which is consistent with third-party forecasters. Notably, Dodge Data and Analytics and the Portland Cement Association or PCA, both forecast growth in construction starts for 2017 and the next several years. These positive trends support our confidence in the ongoing multi-year construction recovery.","As a reminder, the 2017 guidance we provided in February and reaffirmed today does not reflect any benefits that may be gained from potential legislation, increasing federal infrastructure investment, nor does it include any benefits gained from actions taken to reduce businesses' regulatory burden. That said, I would be remiss if I did not underscore that we need weather to cooperate in the second half of 2017.","We said coming into the year, as we always do, that we plan for weather to be normal \u2013 not great, just normal. But the second quarter was wetter than normal in many of our key markets. Thus to meet our guidance, weather must be better than normal for the rest of the year: drier in the near term and warmer as the construction season concludes. Additionally, as public pressure builds on elected officials to move legislation forward, construction activity will benefit, most notably through tax reform and a federal infrastructure improvement package, but also from reduced uncertainty.","We remain encouraged by the bipartisan support in Washington regarding the need for substantial investment in our nation's infrastructure. In fact, just last month, 206 House members signed a letter from the Graves-Norton Subcommittee on Highways and Transit to both the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Committee. These congressional signatories expressed their support for a permanent highway trust fund fix. In the near term however, we believe regulatory relief will benefit the pace of highway construction activity. The ability for states to bring projects forward and expedite large project approvals should generate increased product demand in both the near and long term.","Martin Marietta is dedicated to disciplined capital allocation to enhance shareholder value. The company's capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and include the right value-enhancing acquisitions that enable the successful execution of the company's strategic growth plan, organic capital investment, and the return of cash to shareholders through a meaningful and sustainable dividend and share repurchases.","In line with these capital allocation priorities and in addition to announcing the Bluegrass acquisition, we invested $216 million of organic capital in our business during the first six months of 2017. Since the February 2015 announcement of our share repurchase program, we've returned nearly $1.2 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.","Currently, we have 14.6 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2017 was 1.8 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant.","In summary, and as a reminder, in 2017, we expect aggregate's product line infrastructure shipments to increase in the mid-single digits. Non-residential volumes are expected to increase in the low- to mid-single digits. Residential shipments are expected to increase in the mid- to high-single digits, and ChemRock\/Rail shipments are expected to be stable.","Excluding any impact from the Bluegrass acquisition, on a consolidated basis, we expect a record year, with net sales ranging from $3.750 billion to $3.950 billion, a further expansion of gross profit and increased EBITDA ranging from $1.50 billion to $1.130 billion.","Additionally in today's release, we increased the low end of our capital expenditures guidance to a range of $450 million to $500 million, as we anticipate the acceleration of certain capital projects to further prepare our operations for increased customer demand.","In conclusion, we're proud of our record second quarter results and the ability of our team to manage through short-term disruptions while remaining focused on safety, and the long-term growth of our business. Our leading positions in many of the nation's fastest growing, most vibrant markets reinforces our confidence in Martin Marietta's ability to capitalize on the durable, multi-year construction recovery, and benefit from the expected increased demand throughout 2017 and beyond.","With the relentless focus on world-class safety standards, diligent cost discipline and operational excellence, we remain committed to achieving industry-leading results and further enhancing long-term shareholder value.","This call began with the familiar refrain to every Martin Marietta earnings teleconference for over a decade by introducing Anne Lloyd. As you all know, Anne, will retire from our company this month. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank Ann for her innumerable contributions to Martin Marietta. Anne has played an integral role in the growth of this company, always maintained a relentless focus on accountability and in so doing, has helped to deliver exceptional returns to our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the entire Martin Marietta team, we wish Anne only the best in all things as she begins her next chapter in life.","If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thank you for taking my questions today. Before I launch into questions, I just want to echo, Anne, Ward's comments, It's been a pleasure working with you these many years and we will miss you on the calls and working with you day-to-day and best of luck in retirement. We are all jealous.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Now on to the boring stuff, or not so boring stuff which is the quarter. You had discussed in Q1, some of the increases in personnel cost as you prepared for a big volume year. I guess two-part question. First, let's focus on volumes, help walk through the volume flow-through intra-quarter and how \u2013 what came, what happened and where perhaps there were shortfalls in volumes.","And then the second part of the question, touching on the personnel, how much of the shortfall in volumes in the quarter coupled with higher personnel cost impacted margins? And if there's any other drivers to impact margins in the quarter, it would be helpful for additional color there. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Kathryn, good morning, and thank you for that. I'll address those both in order. So, if we think about the volume flow for the quarter, Kathryn, the most important thing to remember is we had fairly significant portions of our footprint that really experienced almost two-thirds of the quarter with heavy rain.","And what I mean by that is principally the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic. So when we have Georgia and Florida and North Carolina and South Carolina and portions of Virginia feeling disproportionate weather, it does affect our business. It affects our businesses from a customer perspective. It affects our businesses from an operating efficiency perspective.","So the way that I would encourage you to think about it is really it's that portion of the business that felt it disproportionally. There was some sense of that in the Midwest as well. Not as much in the Rocky Mountains, not as much in Texas, but really I would look at the Mid-America Group and I would look at the Southeast Group principally and I would say that they were ones who felt the volume flow most precipitously, no pun intended.","I mean, if I'm looking at volume for the quarter and we look, just as an example, at our North Georgia district, and when we say that, what I really mean is Atlanta. It was off 20% on volume. Anybody who's been to Atlanta over the last several years knows, looking at that marketplace, that's not a place from raw construction activity that feels like it's 20% off and it's not going to be. It was cloudy.","Same issue in a place like Charlotte. The Charlotte district saw volumes down 14%. So when we're talking about cities like Charlotte and Atlanta that are seeing those types of double-digit volumes down, it does affect the way the volume comes and the way the profits flow.","So, if we think about shipments, at least what we could plan for the second quarter, we have planned for over 46 million tons in the second quarter. Actual shipments obviously are just modestly over 43 million tons, so you're 6% below plan. Where you were below plan matters. If we look at our planned production costs, what's remarkable is they were broadly on plan. We were 0.5% above plan on production costs, but here's part of \u2013 back to your point, Kathryn. We did add some personnel in these places where, listening to our customers, we feel like we're going to have a very busy second half of 2017, most likely a very busy 2018. And people candidly are having a hard time understanding why they're not going to have a good 2019.","So we had gone into these areas that we saw growth and we had added an hourly workforce. If we go back and take a look at what that would've meant, here's what it means, practically speaking: on days that the sun is shining, we're staffed just right. On days when it's raining, we're a little bit heavy on head count in some of these areas.","The fact is, if we look at where that was compared to last year, it's probably about $0.10 a share delta, simply driven by the lower volume and the lack of absorption. If we were looking at what we thought the quarter was going to be from a planned shipment perspective that we believe didn't happen because of rain, we would've been looking at about a 70% incremental margin on our stone business in the United States.","So, I think that gives you the bridge that you were looking for, Kathryn, on talking about volume flow in the quarter and relative to personnel.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","That's helpful. Are there any other factors such as inflation, which has been a big theme this quarter, that impacted margins meaningfully?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","No, inflation really has not been a big driver for us. One thing that did have a modest margin impact, and we'll have to see how that plays going forward, is what's happening with some degrees of transportation in the southeastern U.S. CSX Railroad has \u2013 they're finding their way right now. They're clearly going through a model change, moving from unit trains to manifest trains. Their new CEO in fact sent out a communication to customers yesterday and while there's outlining that they have had some issue meeting customer demand up and down their lines, and we did experience some of that going into Florida and some other places as well. So we would've had some of that, Kathryn. But aside from the volume issue which was the primary noise in the quarter, the rest of it's, candidly, a pretty clean quarter.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay, great. On the Bluegrass, just a couple of cleanup questions. I know that you had had in your prepared commentary that the low end of CapEx guidance was primarily driven by the acceleration of capital projects to meet customer demand. To what extent do you anticipate having to spend additional CapEx or just basic capital for Bluegrass, or do you feel pretty good as they're integrated into the system late this year?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Okay. Number one, we don't anticipate any CapEx going into Bluegrass this year. We anticipate really bringing it into the company in Q4. So, we'll go through a planning cycle on that really for next year. In our due diligence on the organization, we looked very carefully at what we believed their CapEx requirements would be. We believe those assets have been very well run. We believe they were well invested and frankly, we looked at their assets from a CapEx perspective and viewed them very similar to ours in the eastern United States. So we don't believe that you will see a disproportionate spike in CapEx as we bring Bluegrass into the fold.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Kathryn, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Ward and Anne.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hello, Trey.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Anne, and yeah, I want to echo what Kathryn said too on the retirement, Anne. It's been a pleasure working with you over the years. Wish you the best and you're going to definitely be missed.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Trey.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","And then I guess, I want to kind of touch on a few things and Ward, you mentioned earlier, I think you even touched on briefly your customers and their backlog and kind of at least directionally what they're seeing out there. But reiterating that guidance after a pretty choppy first half, mostly as you mentioned due to weather, it's obviously implies a pretty aggressive ramp in the back half. If you could give us maybe a little bit more color on what you're seeing out there that gives you the confidence for the back half.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know, Trey, I think you hit it, and that is, we've spent a lot of time \u2013 I have this year and the first half of the year, talking to customers where they are and I've been in an enormous amount of our geography this year. It's more than a dialogue just with our Division Presidents and VP of Operations and Sales. These are operations very directly with customers talking about, and I said it in my prepared remarks, their near-term and medium-term outlooks. And by that what I would say is the typical dialogue I'm hearing from customers is, we have a backlog unlike a backlog we've ever had before. We will go into next year with a backlog that we haven't really seen before going into next year. That ties back into some of the commentary that I've had earlier and I think I mentioned on the previous answer as well.","I think mentioned on the previous answer as well, 2017, to customers looks to be very busy as does 2018 and they're having a hard time understanding why 2019 shouldn't be. Now, you raise a fair point Trey, and that is if first half was wetter than usual, part of what I said in the prepared remarks was, half two needs to be A, drier than usual and the season needs to last a little bit longer than normal. And you've followed our business long enough to see, Trey, there've been some fourth quarters in particular where we have really been able to put up some impressive volume and profitability numbers if an October and a November go particularly well.","So, looking at the back half of the year does the weather have to be good? Yes. Does winter have to be pushed off just modestly? Yes, it does. If we have normal weather for the rest of the year, could that put some degree of volumes pressure on the rest of the year? I think it probably could. I think candidly the EBITDA picture that we're seeing right now actually looks pretty strong. I think we're really resolute about that. At the end of the day, this is about keeping people safe, taking care of shareholders, and making money. And I think that's exactly what we're going to be able to do for the rest of the year. The primary thing that we need is we just need some good weather and we need to be able to let this business run.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All right. That makes sense. Also, you mentioned \u2013 you have mentioned before kind of hiring up in preparation for demand, which makes sense. But you also said that labor shortages in, I think kind of through the channel has played a role or was a factor, at least on the infrastructure side of things year-to-date as well. And when we talk to folks in the channel, it seems like that's one kind of recurring complaint is labor. Obviously nothing new, but with the funding picture improving and the demand picture improving, obviously there's a lot of pent up demand, there's funding that's coming through, lot of things are clicking. But do you think that the tight labor picture downstream really across the board from ready-mixed drivers to paving crews, do you think that that issue \u2013 or I guess I should ask it this way. How does that labor issue in heavy construction play into your longer term thinking for the recovery?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's more of a customer issue than it's going to be a Martin Marietta issue. I think that's the way to begin the conversation. I mean, here's the issue. Number one, it's longer term. Number two, if we look at what's going on on unemployment changes from Q1 of this year, I mean Texas itself is at 4.6% unemployment from 5%. Georgia's at 4.8%, down from 5.1%. Indiana's at 3%, down from 3.9%. Tennessee's at 3.6%, down from 5.1% and Alabama's at 4.6% from 5.8%. What that tells us is number one, there's great job creation, which is going to help underlying construction. Will it create some tightness in some places on getting qualified people who want to work in downstream positions? I think that's probably true.","Are we seeing that on occasion in some places relative to ready-mixed drivers? Yeah, we have. At the same time, what I'd say Trey, in many respects, that's going to end up being a high-class worry because I think those high-class worries will likely drive continued construction in these marketplaces. I think some of this goes back to the dialog too that we're having with our contractor customers right now, because I think they're more willing to hire now than they have been.","The other thing that I see from contractors is they're more willing to invest in capacity today.","And part of what we see in our business, and I'm sure what they're seeing too, is technology is being their friend. So part of what we've been able to do new plants that we've put up for example is we're watching our tons produced per working man hour go up pretty considerably, even when we may not be adding heads to those specific operations.","So, is it going to be something to watch? Yes. I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, I did. Do we see it as a significant stumbling block as we go through 2017, 2018, and 2019? Not significant. Will we talk about it on occasion? Probably so because our contractor clients will as well.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All right, well that all make sense, and I appreciate the color on that, Ward, and thank you and that's it for me. I'll pass it on.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","All right, Trey. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And Anne, let me add my congratulations. We'll miss working with you. Thank you for all of your help over the years and the tremendous performance over your tenure. So thank you.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You're welcome, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I'm wondering if we can talk about the M&A pipeline from here. How are you folks evaluating opportunities, and at which point in the cycle, Ward, would you draw the line and say, okay, we're at the late stages of the cycle and going forward, it'll be more bolt-on acquisitions as opposed to larger scale M&A?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well. I guess a couple of things, Jerry. Always think about what we've said relative to capital allocation, because the way that we look at that hasn't changed. So the right acquisitions and then looking at organic investment and then looking at return of cash to shareholders. We've been very consistent with that for a while. As you may recall, I think on the last earnings call, one of the things that I said was I thought this might be a year of large transactions. And as we sit here at a little past half year, and you look at the transactions that have at least been announced in our space, you've got nicely over $2 billion worth of transactions that have occurred.","Now, that said, one of the things that we're sensitive to as well is we look at our debt to EBITDA ratio, we've said where we want to be over a period of time. Obviously, if transactions come forward, we're going to look at transactions. We're also committed to maintaining a healthy and appropriate balance sheet as we go through this period in the cycle.","As to the other part of your question on where are we in this cycle right now, keep in mind, it's an odd cycle because at the last peak, we at Martin Marietta produced and sold 205 million tons, and at the bottom we were at 125 million. Last year, even with the volume that we had brought in from TXI, we were about 156 million. So, looking at where we are in the cycle from a tonnage perspective, it's still relatively early. We see continued growth in housing, and housing's still not back to a 50-year average. Based on what we're seeing in non-residential, light non-residential's going to be very good for the rest of this year. We think it's going to be healthy into next. But we also think the heavy portion of non-res is likely to get healthier for us next year.","And then the other thing that's destined to happen, Jerry, is with the state-level initiatives that have been underway, in our largest states, and if we look at them by revenue, and we'd say number one is Texas, number two is Colorado, number three is North Carolina, number four is the combination of Georgia\/Florida, number five is Iowa, number six is Indiana. If we look at those states and say that's over 70% of our revenue, it's hard to look at where we are in the cycle from a tonnage perspective, to see where we are from a FAST Act perspective, to see where we are from a state initiatives perspective, to see where we are from a residential perspective, and then to measure where we are in non-res and feel like we're anywhere late in this cycle.","So do I think there will be more M&A? I think there will be. Do I think there'll be more large deals this year? If I'm speculating right now, I would say probably not. I think the year has seen that. Do I think people will be broadly more focused on bolt-on activity for a period of time? I think probably so. Will we be focused on integration over the next X months? You bet. Will we thoughtfully consider transactions that we feel like fit Martin Marietta well and meet the needs of our long-term shareholders? Of course we will. But right now we're awfully focused on, A, finishing this transaction with Bluegrass and making sure we're in a position to integrate it in the most thoughtful way, the same way that we did with TXI.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you, Ward. And on permitting, you've been very vocal on the need to drive permitting times down. I'm wondering based on the task force that was set up, are you seeing the executive branch moving fast enough in that direction, and what needs to happen at the executive branch level to really drive permitting times down? And I guess are you hearing that we're moving in that direction from your folks in D.C.?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's certainly getting a lot better. I mean, the reform issues that we're most focused on is reduced project delays, reduced project costs, and less opportunities for frivolous litigation. And I think if we can get those, we'll see some serious progress that'll be made. It was interesting, I was reading The Wall Street Journal last week, and it was giving an update really on what they were seeing from their view on regulatory actions, at least by this White House and the OMB, what their budget contained. This was interesting, Jerry; a little over 1,700 preliminary proposed refiner rules.","And you say that number at first glance and you go, well, 1,700 feels like a lot until you realize that was down 40% from its peak under the prior administration and a 17-year low. So in many respects, what we're seeing right now are reversals of earlier rules, and we saw 66 of those completed at the U.S. EPA, and a third of them were withdrawals. So from that perspective, Jerry, it's interesting to look at where we aren't on healthcare today. It's interesting to see where we're not yet on tax reform, although that seems to be next. And then you would assume infrastructure is next, but I do believe what the administration has done from a regulatory perspective has actually been helpful and has been somewhat unheralded.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Very interesting. And, Ward, on a short-term standpoint, you've always characterized the businesses as an outdoor sport, and obviously we had weather in the second quarter. Can you talk about how much visibility you have on the high-single digit volume growth that we need to see in the back half to hit the full-year guidance, I guess? Did we start the third quarter on the right foot in that direction?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, obviously, what I've tried to talk to, Jerry, is what we hear from our customers right now. And I think the other thing that's worthy of note, I did read the comments from some of our European friends who I know outlined that they anticipate a very busy back half of the year. I think that's what we anticipate as well. As I said, two things need to happen. We need dry weather, and we need a late winter. And based on everything that our customers are saying, we can be and they will be very busy if those two things happen.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Hey, good morning guys.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hi, Timna.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","We also want to echo the comments wishing Anne all the best and thanking her for all the help over the years.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Timna.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure. So wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance if I could. We were interested to see that you kept full-year guidance despite the weather which you've addressed. But if you look at some of the items like SG&A and other components, it would appear that some of the costs are also going to fall off in the second half. We just wanted to make sure that we understood what might be driving that.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well. I think, one thing, if you're looking at SG&A, part of what we're doing this year on SG&A is accruing at a level that you saw us accrue up to toward the end of last year. So in large part, that just evens itself out over the year. The other thing that I would come back and specifically address is we have added hourly head count as we discussed earlier in the call. If we get the volume pull-through that we anticipate, again, if we had had the volume in Q2 that we had anticipated, we would've had 70% incrementals in our aggregates business.","So, from a cost perspective, again, if I'm looking at planned production costs for the quarter, they were exactly where we thought that they would be. Volume was down. I think I know exactly why volume was down. I think we understand very much what's going on relative to SG&A as I just outlined for you. So, from a cost perspective, and when you come back and measure in the fact that we have tried to do a good bit of stripping or grading in the early part of the year and some maintenance and repair, costs in the back half of the year should tend to be our friend.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for that detail. We were also wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on how to think about CapEx going forward given that as you pointed out, you think we've still got extended runway ahead of us. What we're running at utilization wise, and what is the kind of CapEx that we should think about, maybe into the future years relative to what you've said through 2017?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? Clearly, we've taken CapEx up here in the near-term. But we've taken CapEx up here in the near-term really relative to two very specific items. One, we feel like and believe that we have the ability to do some generational land purchases, at some very specific locations that we think are important to the long-term of our business, and we're focused on that. The other thing that we've done is we have accelerated some work in the Rocky Mountains on a sales yard that we're trying to finalize that's going in in northern Colorado up near Fort Collins.","So, here the near-term, those are the issues that we're looking at. I think over the long-term, we've really not changed the view that we would've offered to you earlier in the year. We're probably looking at a standard run rate of $350 million to up. Let's call it $350 million to $450 million through this cycle. And we don't think that that's a bad place to be given what we believe the volume trajectory is likely to be if we continue to see infrastructure non-res and res move in positive directions.","Keep in mind, part of what the industry did, and we were no exception, although I don't think we cut as much as others. The industry did pull back on CapEx during the downturn. And typically what you would see in a normalized time is companies spending on CapEx numbers roughly equivalent to DD&A, and we got below DD&A in the down cycle. Others got even farther below that than we did. I think you will see most responsible companies spending CapEx above DD&A right now to make sure that they can run with effectiveness and meet customer needs. So I think that's responsive, Timna. Did I hit your question?","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Except for the part about, that a snuck in on the utilization, if you wouldn't mind updating us on where you are there please.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? What we're really looking for now is great efficiencies on the organic CapEx that we're putting in. From a utilization perspective, back to the comment that I made before, at peak, before we had acquired TXI, we produced and sold 205 million tons of stone. Now what I tell you back in 2006 when we were doing that, we were pushed pretty hard and were we in a position that we were bringing in temporary crushing equipment? Yeah we were. What I would tell you is based on the assets that we have really prior to TXI, 190 million tons is probably a good solid run area for us.","We added 15 million tons with TXI. That's going to take you very, very nicely up to that 205 million tons number before, then obviously we're coming in with this tonnage from Bluegrass. So, from a capacity perspective, we've got room to run, and as I outlined in my prepared commentary, the marketplaces that Bluegrass operates in are still 20% to 30% below where they were at peak.","So, had a meeting earlier this week with a very specific Department of Transportation and one of the issues that this specific DOT referenced is, what we've done some things over the last few years to amp up our ability to invest more in transportation. We want to make sure that you can be there for us. And I said whatever you're worrying list is, don't have our ability to run at higher volume levels as one of the high items of worry on your list. We can do that.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That makes sense. Okay. Thanks again.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Timna.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Schrier with Citi. Your line is now open.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and same things, Anne. Congrats on your retirement. I want to start off and ask about the back half of the year, possibly in a different way. You talked about the confidence you're getting in the volume growth. And if we look at the guidance, it seems like you'll need some pretty impressive incremental margins to get there, which would obviously include a lot of pricing. And we're seeing that strong pricing in the Southeast. Possibly some of your other regions, pricing is a little lower. So I just wanted to see how we can get some conviction that we're going to seek pricing in Mid-America and West accelerate a bit in the back half of the year so we can get those strong incremental margins.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Sure. Here's something, Scott, that I think's actually a really important point to bring out in more detail, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks as well. We did have some sales of fill material in basically North Carolina on one job that made our AST look actually considerably lower than it was. Keep in mind the fill material that we sold was really a waste product that we were selling to contractors on a bypass job in eastern North Carolina where they had run into unsuitable soils.","So, what was happening here is it was a waste product, we needed to get it out of our way and they needed it for unsuitable soils. That all by itself took the ASP down almost artificially. So, ex that fill product, we were at about 4.7% up in the Mid-Atlantic division, that really is North Carolina. And if we look at June ASPs for that division all by itself, it was at 5.1% ASP up.","So again, if we're looking at what I think will be tight supply later in the year in the Rockies in the West, what I think will be a very busy year in Texas, particularly in the north, when you look at good pricing in the Southeast at double digits and when you look at what's normalized in Mid-Atlantic now at about 5.1, I think that gives you a much better feel for accuracy on pricing, Scott. Is that responsive?","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. That's very helpful. And then, I wanted to follow up on the comment you made on the customers talking about their massive backlogs that they were having. Did you get any sense from those backlogs? Are those growing more on the private side or the public side?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know, what I think the short answer is, yes. I think they're seeing good growth across the spectrum right now. Part of what I was encouraged by is, for example, on that bypass job in eastern North Carolina, somebody had asked a question earlier and they said, if you're selling fill material like that, isn't that more required on new construction? And the answer is, yes it is. And the fact is that's good new public works. I think contractors are seeing more opportunities to bid on that.","I equally believe in the markets that we serve, private work continues to be good. I mean we're clearly seeing a shift toward more single-family as opposed to multi-family. But multi-family in our markets still is a very healthy underlying market. The other bidding that we're seeing a lot of activity on will be that next phase of large energy projects in South Texas and in the Gulf. So again, I think as the FAST Act continues to mature, as state initiatives continue to move forward, and in our markets where private work continues to expand, yes, they're seeing both public and private activity get better, Scott.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And one more, just wanted to ask quickly on the ready-mixed pricing. Just if you could talk about some of your conditions in Texas and Colorado, it looks like it was a little softer also this quarter.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, I guess a couple of things. One, what we saw in Texas was entirety what we expected in Texas. So if you think back to the guidance that we gave on that business, we said that a lot of that high-margin, high-price work that we had had last year driven by some of those large LNG projects in the Gulf would be going through a trough period this year. So not to expect as much relative to geographic mix and raw profitability in the downstream.","What I did say in my prepared remarks is the type of pricing that we're broadly seeing in Texas right now is around that 5%, and again if we look at ready-mixed pricing in Colorado, I won't go into specific numbers there, but let's just say it's one of our better priced ready-mixed markets today.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate you taking my questions.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","All right. Take care, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. One quick question. So you're couple months into process of Bluegrass. Are you guys hearing anything different from the regulators as it might relate to any divestitures, anything like that?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? As you recall, Stanley, we went through obviously what we thought was a very thoughtful process on that. And I think our team does analytics around that very, very well. We don't see any material divestitures coming out of that that we think will be value destructive to that transaction. We have the same conviction around that transaction today that we had on the day that we discussed it. We have filed Hart-Scott and we're working our way, what I would suggest to you, in a very orderly, very workman like, very Martin Marietta way through the process. So today, Stanley, no surprises, and we have a high degree of confidence that what we've outlined to you previously is still where we are.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. And then, how do we think about kind of capital structure post the deal? What are you thinking about in terms of duration or rate? Anything to help us, especially with the appetite for your type of credit in the marketplace being so good right now.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, yeah. Stanley, as we talked about when we announced the deal, we'll be financing this in the public marketplace. Our view is that we've got a long asset and there is a pull or a need for investment in 30-year notes out in the marketplace, and we think that that would be an attractive feature. We want to balance that with the ability to have some pre-payable debt with the full intent of de-levering the business within 12 months to 18 months post acquisition. That would basically have us doing probably some 2, 7, 10 and \u2013 maybe 2, 7 and 30-year notes. We think that an average rate there will be just shy of 4%.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. And then, Ward, last one for me. You had mentioned some discussions around finding a permanent solution for the highway trust fund. I mean, do you think that there's enough of an appetite for that? Is that something we could reasonably expect in the near future?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? It's fascinating to me because I've been at several meetings with administration members, members of Congress and others. And what they're all saying right now is, there are no options that are off the table. And I've heard among other people the Treasury Secretary say that as well. So I think people are going to look at this in a eyes wide open fashion because I do think there's a general understanding that the investment is needed. And two, it does create very nice long-term middle class jobs. So I think you're going to see a fairly significant and I think healthy debate on this. I think part of what helps, frankly, they have to do something. I mean, they literally \u2013 healthcare has not worked. Everybody needs a victory right now. It's fascinating. Go back if you can and take a look at a letter that Tom Donohue wrote in an open letter to the members of Congress here last week.","And he outlined to them very clearly what they were looking for. They at the U.S. Chamber are looking for people who will underscore and help promote growth in the United States and people who are interested in governing. And he made it very clear that when the U.S. Chamber for example is coming back and taking score of who they're going to support or who they're not going to support in this next election, they're going to look at those two things. And he closed the letter with the words, members of Congress be warned, failure is not an option.","So, part of what I outlined in the prepared remarks is as we watch people move toward a higher degree of necessary governance, I believe our sense is this is part of the necessary governance.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, no. That sounds good. Well, thank you guys very much. Best of luck through the rest of the year. And Anne, best wishes to you. You certainly will be missed. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","See you, Stanley.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Norfleet with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good morning or now afternoon. But again, I'd like to congratulate Anne on a great run and good luck in your future endeavors.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Rob.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Just real quickly, most of my questions have been answered. But, Ward, I guess previously you've discussed some stone shortages in certain markets. Could you kind of discuss what geographies that we're seeing in that in? And then secondly, obviously this is the second quarter where we saw a continued acceleration in obviously spending related to preparing for increased demand in the back half of the year. Has that program basically run its course, or should we expect to see more of that in the second half of the year? Thanks.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I guess a couple of things, Rob. As we were talking about places that we thought you might have the potential for spot shortages, when we discussed on the last call, I think specifically we called out portions of the Rocky Mountains, portions of the Midwest, and some portions of the Carolinas. So I guess what I would say at this point, I still think you could see that in portions of the Rockies. The Midwest got hit with some rain. So part of the question is going to be how far ahead of inventories can they stay right now? My guess is after Q2, I'm not as concerned about tightness in that market as I would've been when we were having the call back in February.","And I equally would say to you one of the markets that I think we expected to be the busiest this year in North Carolina would've been Charlotte. And I think part of what I was outlining when I was going through my prepared remarks is when you're looking at a market like Charlotte, it was down on volume 14% in the second quarter. I think that probably gives them some comfort there, Rob. So I do think there can be some tightness in some markets this year. I don't think as many as we thought earlier, simply because of what we weathered with the weather, no pun intended.","I do believe, to the next part of your question, that we have gotten ahead of what we think will be a very busy year for the rest of 2017 and 2018. So I don't anticipate significant more costs. Part of what we're sensitive to, and you've heard us speak to it in tight labor markets, one of the real challenges is making sure you're getting the quality labor that you want, who come to your company with the values that matter, and we're in a position to train them to operate safely. And we believe that's exactly what we've done with what we have in place today.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Perfect. Thanks so much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Rob.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Hi, Ward and Anne. Congratulations to you, Anne.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate it.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Ward, I just want to make sure I understand what you're trying to say about the back half of the year and weather. If we have normal weather, are you saying you would miss the EBITDA range entirely or just maybe trend towards the lower end?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","No. What I'm saying is if we have normal weather, we might have trouble meeting some of the volume expectations that we have for the full year right now, because obviously, to achieve the volume guidance that we have, we're going to have to be in a position to run hard. And actually what I was saying is, as I'm looking at the way things are trending, if we had something that was more normal as opposed to better, I would think the volumes would be under more pressure than the EBITDA would be under. Now, of course there's a linkage between the two. I'm not ignoring that, but I'm just looking at it on a relative basis, Adam.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, you referenced in, I think, your letter some mid-year price increases. Can you just provide some additional color on that?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah, the mid-year price increases had gone in in some markets. They're not hugely widespread. They're more project by project, size by size, sometimes location by location based. Part of what we've heard very clearly from our customer base is from a planning perspective, it helps them considerably more if they can plan for that one time and do that coming into the year. And in many respects, we planned for that this year and they did as well. So they have not been as widespread as we would've seen in years past. At the same time coming into the year, you were seeing relatively robust pricing.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb with CJS Securities.","Your line is now open.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hello, Craig.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","I will chime in. Anne, you rock. You will be missed.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Craig.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","The volume you lost to weather happened in markets where you're not really capacity constrained and the construction industry overall I would think is not constrained in those markets. So can you get caught up more quickly in the Carolinas and Georgia?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Again, yeah, the short answer is you're right. We can crush plenty of stone in the Carolinas and Georgia today. I think we can certainly put it on the ground to meet the customers' needs. I think it's going to be how much can they take and how much can the weather permit. I think those are the issues that we're going to run into, Craig.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And all the facility cleanups were done by the end of the quarter?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. I mean from just rain events and otherwise, yeah, largely so.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, is it fair to assume that you guys are in the middle of it with the pickup in highway volumes, or is it a little more muted than expected?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I'll concede it has been slower than I would've thought. And I think it's been slower than a lot of people would've thought. I don't have any concern about what the end result will be because you've got the FAST Act, you've got the funding, and you've got the state initiatives. So I know that's coming. But I will concede I think the work itself has moved slower.","Now, in fairness, one of the things that we outlined is that work tends to be more weather sensitive than many. And think of it in these terms, Craig. If you're pouring a concrete foundation for a non-residential use, you can go out there and pour that between storms if you've got a good sub-base that's in. By contrast, if you're building or constructing new highway or new lanes and you have significant earthwork that has to be undertaken, you can't do that when it's wet. You literally can't move those heavy, wet, clayey soils. So, I do think the public work is probably disproportionally impacted by wet weather, and I do think there is disproportionate new public work that's coming in portions of those Southeastern markets as well. So if we're looking at some of the work around Atlanta or the work on I-4 in Florida or part of what's going on on I-77 in Charlotte, those are big public jobs and they were clearly weather affected.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And since no one else has asked it, it's a small product line but you blew it out with asphalt and paving in the quarter. Is there anything changing or can you give us more color around that?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","You know what? It was a great quarter. I think they're going to have a great year. Frankly, the expectations for 2018 in that business continue to be very strong. The outlook is good, the backlog is strong, strong demand from municipalities there. You know, keep in mind, that's really only a Colorado business for us. So everything from Greeley down to Colorado Springs, which was really a new market for us as we went into it early last year, are really very attractive. I talked about the funding that we're seeing in places like Colorado Springs. We've got an exceptional team running that business up and down the Rocky Mountains, and I just can't say enough good things about them. That's a business that has performed exceptionally well, and we continue to look for great things from them.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. For all the things you just described, it would suggest that maybe the ag volumes in Colorado are similar to what you're seeing in asphalt and paving because there (01:06:36).","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, it goes back to part of the commentary that I had and that is, if there's a place that I think before the end of the year that might be tight on ag volumes in our footprint, it's most likely going to be Colorado, because what you've got in Colorado is an awfully powerful combination of public work that's good and private work that's good. So what we're seeing in that marketplace, remember, that's the only place that we're vertically integrated all the way through from stone to ready-mix, to hot-mix and hot-mix paving right now. There's not a lot that's not working for us in Colorado today.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Great. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Craig.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, this is actually Jeff (1:07:28) in for Garik. I really appreciate you taking my questions. My first is following up on a question Scott had earlier about Mid-America pricing coming in a little lower than was expected and Ward, you mentioned the role mix played. Are you expecting any other mix headwinds as we move into the back half of the year that could play a similar role in pricing coming in maybe a little lower than how people were expecting?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","The fact is there may be a little bit more fill work that we'll do in that marketplace. But again, what I would encourage you to remember, we're not cannibalizing aggregate sales with the fill work. I mean, this is the right absolute right financial operational and otherwise decision on that. It is purely an optical circumstance. I mean, pricing in that division and in that part of the country is moving the way that you would expect. So if you see some more fill in that marketplace, the way I would think about that if I were you is we're getting a waste product, we're being paid for it, we're moving it out of our quarries and most likely opening up more reserves in the process. So could you see some of that in the second half particularly as you see more brand new construction? I think so. Is it anything in my view for you to be concerned about? I would certainly dissuade you from being concerned about that.","Unknown Speaker","Got it, got it. Thanks. And you had a solid quarter in cement with 8% volume growth. Can you get a little more color into how the quarter played out and any update on the potential mid-year price increase as well?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. You're right. We think that was a good quarter. Volume was our friend, pricing was our friend, costs were our friend and gross profit all improved versus the prior year. Pricing was up 5% versus the prior year. Most of the gains were concentrated in the North, so they were largely ahead of expectations. The South lagged out a little bit. By that I mean, really what's going in San Antonio. Part of what's going to be our friend on that as we go through the years is our kiln expenses are expected to be down.","So, if I gave you a good sense of what they should look like for the rest of the year, that's probably helpful. Obviously in Q1, we had kiln expenses of $4.2 million; in Q2, $3.5 million. In Q3, we're expecting $400,000. In Q4, we're expecting about $10.2 million. So we're looking for full-year kiln expenses there of about $18.3 million which is compared to $20.9 million in the prior year, so about a $2.6 million friendly number there.","Part of what I like about the cement business in Texas, if we're looking at what forecasts say going out as far as 2021, that's a marketplace that's anticipating about 19.6 million tons of need by the time it gets to 2021. That's versus about 16.2 million tons this year, so that market continues to grow. We're in a position that we can grow with it. Our share has remained very steady at 20% to 21%. We are looking at we believe about a $12 a ton price increase as we come into the year next year. We have had some conversations about an October price increase, that's TBD. We'll just have to see how that goes. But again we feel very good about the $12 that we put in for next year. Some of that ties back into the commentary that I offered before and that is people are much more moved by one price increase at the beginning of the year that they can plan for and the less mid-years, frankly, the better customers will feel about it.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you. Appreciate it, Ward, and Anne, congrats on your retirement.","Anne H. Lloyd - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff (1:11:17).","Operator","Thank you and this does conclude today's Q&A session.

Except to the extent required by applicable law Martin Marietta undertakes no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.","Martin Marietta refers you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our fourth quarter results and to Martin Marietta\u2019s other filings with the SEC, which can be found on the SEC\u2019s website.","Our fourth quarter earnings exceeded market expectations and the prior year as we continued to execute against our clearly articulated strategic objectives. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $0.52 excluding business development costs not factored into analyst expectations or approximately $0.14 greater than the market consensus and 58% greater than the prior year quarter\u2019s adjusted earnings per share. Inclusive of the $0.20 per diluted share charge for these expenses our earnings per diluted share were $0.32.","Our fourth quarter results reflect a 6% increase in the average selling price for our heritage aggregates product line. This increase cast a year where we saw steady pricing growth in each quarter and confirms our previously stated view that pricing momentum is sustainable. Moreover 2011 pricing trends validate one of our fundamental beliefs that despite depression like shipment declines over the past five years our aggregates product line has and continue to retain its ability to realize the inherent value of the in place mineral reserves.","Of note, we achieved fourth quarter pricing increases in each of our reportable groups led by an almost 8% increase in our West Group. This performance reflects double digit increases in our South Texas markets driven by increasing demand for material needed in drilling and related projects in the Eagle Ford shale. There is also an element of long haul mix in this price increase.","As you may recall we developed a new rail located sales yard in South Texas principally designed to meet Eagle Ford demand. The average selling price from that sales yard reflects transportation costs however; even excluding shipments from the new sales yard this market still reported a double digit price increase. Our aggregate product line pricing continues to vary by market. Nevertheless, with few exceptions nearly every market reported growth in the fourth quarter.","Looking ahead, we anticipate our average selling price to be affected by our recent asset exchange with Lafarge North America. In that transaction we acquired operations in Denver, Colorado a truck served market with typical sales transactions completed at producing quarries. This contrast with the Mississippi river facilities we divested, which primarily represented a long haul distribution market. Accordingly, these river operations had sales prices reflecting the varying cost of transportation from a producing location to a more distant sales yard. Overall, we are forecasting pricing trends to remain steady in 2012 with the increase in our heritage aggregates product line, ranging from 2% to 4%. Pricing will continue to vary by market and increases will not be uniform throughout our business.","Our operating performance continues to benefit from our Specialty Products segment, which completed a stellar year that exceeded our expectations. This business generated new fourth quarter records for both net sales and earnings. Net sales of $51.5 million represent a 16% increase over the prior year quarter reflecting growth in both the dolomitic lime and chemicals product lines. These increased sales along with effective cost management resulted in a 600 basis point improvement in this businesses gross margin over the prior year quarter despite higher energy costs. Earnings from operations for the quarter were $16.3 million in 2011 a 55% increase over the prior year quarter.","Cost control remains an area of focus as evidenced by our fourth quarter results and recent restructuring activities. Our SG&A expenses for the quarter declined $4 million excluding a $1.6 million charge for non-recurring termination costs. These organizational changes should provide approximately $3 million of annual cost savings beginning this year. Including the non-recurring termination costs our SG&A expenses as the percent of net sales was 8.5%. As we always have we continue to evaluate SG&A expenses in order to further enhance our industry leading performance in this area.","Fourth quarter direct product cost in our heritage aggregates product line increased 1% even after absorbing an 11% increase in non-controllable energy costs. As a reminder, diesel fuel remains the single largest component of our energy expenses and the price of diesel fuel increased 27% in the fourth quarter compared with prior year quarter and 39% when comparing the full year 2011 with 2010. Lower personnel and depreciation expenses helped offset the escalation in energy costs. Overall our cost of sales increased 9.5% reflecting higher raw material expenses as well as the higher energy prices mentioned earlier.","During the quarter, we incurred $15.1 million of business development expenses, which include costs for completed transactions and the cost associated with our proposal to combine Martin Marietta with Vulcan Materials Company. As mentioned earlier, we completed an asset exchange with Lafarge North America in December. As part of the transaction we exchanged Mississippi river locations operating in a market that did not provide the best opportunity for us to achieve our desired long-term rate of return on assets. The exchange of these assets does not signal a change in strategy related to our long haul distribution network. We remain fully committed to this unparalleled network of rail and water served operations.","So this exchange transaction did offer us the unique opportunity to gain a platform position in the attractive Denver, Colorado market, including both aggregates and complementary downstream businesses. The opportunity to acquire a leading position in Denver\u2019s attractive considering it\u2019s higher than average population growth and for capital income as well as its ability to attract both national and multi-national businesses.","Further, the Colorado Department of Transportation\u2019s recent authorization to initiate more than $2 billion of improvements to Northern Colorado transportation network should provide numerous opportunities for our newly acquired operations. We also acquired a ready mix concrete company in Denver to complement the operations acquired from Lafarge further enhancing our market position.","In summary, these transactions promote a clearly stated long-term objective to have a leading position in markets with attractive growth and other key demographics, which in turn enhances shareholder value. We are pleased to welcome our new Rocky Mountain division employees to the Martin Marietta family and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our former river operation employees for years of dedicated services and I know they will be great assets to Lafarge.","The other component of business development costs relates to our proposal to combine Martin Marietta with Vulcan. On December 12, we initiated an offer to issue one half of the Martin Marietta share of common stock for each outstanding share of Vulcan\u2019s common stock. We continue to believe the combination of our company with Vulcan provides the compelling opportunity to enhance value per shareholders of both companies. We remain committed to making this transaction a reality.","Our heritage aggregate shipments declined 1.2% for the quarter, similar to aggregates pricing volume variances differed significantly by market. Mid East Group reported a 6.6% increase in heritage aggregate shipments, this growth was particularly strong in the West Virginia and Indiana markets, which benefited from strong energy shipments and the rebuild Indy program respectively. Consistent with our expectations the Mid East Group reported incremental operating margin excluding freight and delivery revenues of 60% after adjusting for the volatile rise in energy cost. Volume growth in the Mid East Group contrasted the 6.4% heritage volume decline in the South East Group driven by continued weakness in the North Georgia and Alabama markets.","There was a 2% decline in our heritage infrastructure end-use market versus the prior year quarter as the extension of federal highway funding through March 31, 2012 has not provided the security of long-term federal funding. However, infrastructure volumes declines varied by segment and largely correlate to the strength of state budgets and the availability of alternative funding mechanisms. Of note, transportation spending in Texas remained strong partly due to the funding from the North Texas Tollway Authority. We continue to believe that underlying demand exists for infrastructure projects once long-term federal funding is resolved growth in this end-use market should quickly follow in the mini markets in which we operate.","Our heritage non-residential end-use market increased slightly from the prior year quarter. This growth was supported by our South Texas market where non-residential volume nearly doubled due to energy sector shipments to the Eagle Ford Shale. Our heritage residential end-use shipments increased 2% over the prior year quarter. And finally our heritage ChemRock\/Rail end-use market declined 4%, which given the significant amount of agricultural line shipments in the prior year quarter made more challenging comparison.","Our focus on cash generation allowed us to end the year with a strong cash position. Operating cash flow of $259 million and our available sources of liquidity provided the resources to invest $155 million for organic growth capital projects as well as $92 million for three acquisitions during the year. We also maintained our dividend rate of $1.60 per common share for the year. Prudent use of cash allowed us to maintain balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. At December 31, 2011 our consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.25 times in compliance with the limits under our debt covenants.","A variety of factors beyond our direct control continue to make it challenging to forecast future performance. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the fact that the President continues to advocate rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure. We are also pleased this past Friday when the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed a five year surface transportation reauthorization bill known as the American Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act of 2012.","This much needed legislation would provide average annual funding at a level consistent with current funding. However, we believe the bills proposed before provisions would result in more dollars being available for highway spending. While we are hopeful that the Senate will act quickly to approve a multi-year bill I would remind you that the conferencing process between the house and the senate is critical to a final bill.","In our view, if this process is not successfully completed before the expiration date of the highway programs current continuing resolution it\u2019s likely that any future action on the final bill will be delayed beyond the Presidential Election. One last note, should the conferencing process be successful and we do have a final bill or the expiration of the current continuing resolution. We would not expect the impact to be significant until 2013. Our expectation for aggregates full year volume guidance is consistent with the McGraw Hill forecast.","The previously mentioned uncertainty in the timing of long-term federal funding and the veining impact of stimulus shipments are expected to lead to a slight decline in heritage infrastructure volume. We expect double digit growth in our heritage non-residential shipments driven by increased demand from the energy sector. Heritage residential shipments are expected to increase at a higher rate compared with 2011. Finally, we expect our heritage ChemRock\/ Rail volume to be consistent with 2011. Overall, we expect heritage aggregates volume to increase from 3% to 4%. As I previously mentioned, we expect overall heritage aggregates product line pricing to increase from 2% to 4%.","Our heritage aggregates direct product costs per ton is expected to decline slightly as increased production generates operating efficiencies. These expectations did not factor in significant increases in energy prices. Our SG&A expenses exclusive of the incremental expense at our new Denver operations are expected to decline slightly with benefits from our restructuring activities offsetting higher pension costs. We expect the net effect of our recently acquired Denver operations and divested river operations to be neutral to our EBITDA in 2012. We expect improvement in SG&A expenses related to the Denver operations as we integrate them into our disciplined cost structure.","Earnings from our Specialty Product segment are expected to remain consistent with the record level established in 2011. We also expect interest expense to remain flat this year. Our effective tax rate is expected to approximate 26% and our capital expenditures are forecast at $155 million. This estimate includes the remaining $35 million related to the new kiln at the Woodville, Ohio operation of our Specialty Products business.","We note that our expectation for 2012 assumes Martin Marietta on a standalone basis and does not give effect to the potential impact as a proposed combination of Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials Company. This is a very exciting time for Martin Marietta. We remain focused on operating our business with the disciplined approach and delivering results enhancing long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials and the operator will now give the required instructions we would be happy to address any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your line is open.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Hi, good afternoon Howard, good afternoon Anne. My question relates to the 6% pricing improvement that you had in Q4. I would love to understand the factors behind it since it was higher than the effect did it include the run off of maybe some earlier lower priced highway work. And then perhaps you could expand on the sustainability in the upcoming year within the context of your 2% to 4% expectation as you highlighted.","Howard Nye","Arnie, thank you. Arnie, what we saw during the quarter is pricing moving very favorably really across our business where we saw volumes moving in a positive direction some of which we saw in South Texas related to the Eagle Ford Shale type demand pricing actually moved even better. Some of that was mix actually very little of it. Part of what I was taken by even in markets where we saw volume going down and North Texas being a good example.","We actually saw volumes down in North Texas and pricing going up. So as that come back and try to assess that Arnie I think what that means is what we said in the past is broadly correct and that is we didn\u2019t need volume to necessarily go up, we needed volume to stay relatively flat and stabilized and with stable volumes you start to see the ability to recognize the in place reserves. And I think that\u2019s entirely what we are seeing.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Okay, my follow up question also relates to the margins in the West Group, which were noticeably weak given the positive revenue trend you have and some of the pricing trends. Can you highlight some of the specific factors that may have impacted the West Group and how we should think about that in the upcoming year?","Howard Nye","Sure, I think a couple of things Arnie. Number one, if you look at volume for the West Group that probably was down 1.4% for the year. So we continue to see volume going down. I think that\u2019s one of the issues that we just recognized across the enterprise and that is you are really working a lot of fixed cost against a very low volume. I think even more of moment related to the West is really what\u2019s happening with energy.","If you look year-on-year there are, I want to say $19.2 million of energy costs that were in there around 9.2 of that tied directly to the cost of liquid. Keep in mind that\u2019s one of the few places that we actually have hot mix in our heritage snapshot. If you go by and you call that $19.2 million out what you will see is on a normalized basis we were probably looking at incremental margins around 80%. So I think if you really pull energy out of it, it looks much more like what you could ordinarily expect.","The other thing that I would remind you is we did have more long haul in the West this year. We added the new sales yard in Millet and we are also looking at a new yard in Kansas City. So I think between long haul and energy that addresses most of the issues to last.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Hi.","Howard Nye","Hey, Todd.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Well given the (Inaudible) certainly seems like there is more of a disconnect now than previously has been between your heritage market and your consolidated for a total that we are trying to sort out for this year. You\u2019ve got to help in bridge out or understand how your guidance on volumes for 3% to 4% heritage growth translates to how we should think about sort of the total company\u2019s extent now?","Howard Nye","Here is what I would suggest to you I think we are going to put something out on our website when we are done today that will give you a sense of how heritage really looks going forward. I think that should help you considerably in your modeling Todd at the same time what I would suggest is coming back and looking at the acquisition activity here is directionally what I would offer to you.","Assumed that on the stone side there is going to be about 8 million tons of stone that\u2019s added from the acquisitions that we did last year now keep in mind the acquisitions were in the Western United States so as you are putting 8 million tons in assume the types of pricing that you come to see in the West. The other thing I would encourage you to do is go back and put in around 800,000 cubic yards of ready mix and around 1.5 million tons of hot mix. I think if you adjust your models to take into account what we are going to recap for use heritage and then you put that degree of stone in, plus that degree of ready mix and as well that should get you where you need to be Todd.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","That\u2019s perfect. And then same sort of the concept thinking about price last year in the river district. How much of a given that that was most of the long haul I would assume that made the average price in that region. How much of it do you have a way for us to understand how much that sort of used the price in that region if it did?","Howard Nye","What I would tell you to do is look at that broadly along corporate averages up and down that river. I think that\u2019s probably your safest way to look at but I think again if you do it that way what you will see is it will have a downward optical view on pricing. Simply puts pricing in the West tends to be lower.","Anne Lloyd","And Todd what we will do is recap the last five years obviously with the river movement in discontinued ops history essentially gets recapped at the same time. And we will put out on the website also some volume and pricing trends that show you that differential.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","That would be great. Thanks. In the residential end market can you tell us what that was for the full year 2011 versus year-on-year?","Howard Nye","The rent market for us full year we did see, well we are seeing this year going to the year Todd to give you a sense of \u201912 first as we are seeing that up 10% to 14% year-on-year. I think as we looked at res for the full year it was slightly up but I want to say it was in the single digits. There we are clearly seeing more activity as we move into \u201912.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Got it. On the Woodville expansion you mentioned that $35 million of spending there. Is that generally on pace with the comments you made before.","Howard Nye","Yeah, it is. In fact from everything we can tell that project is in entirely moving along the way that we have expected to from an on time, on cost and otherwise.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Then final question on the Vulcan deal. And as part of your state desire to get the Vulcan board to come back to the table. I think the last update we had was on January I think hence that that has not happened yet can you, is there any update on that that you could give us?","Howard Nye","Alright, you know I think this is the third time I have spoken roughly since we announced our transaction or proposed transaction on December 12. And on December 12, I put a call into Birmingham and send a Birmingham and sent an email to Birmingham. And obviously we would very much like to engage in the dialogue as we sit here today we are still looking for that dialogue.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thanks a lot.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak from BB&T. Your line is open.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hi Jack.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Could you guys tell us your ready mix, yards and your hot mix, tons for 2011 full year?","Howard Nye","You know, what if you are looking at hot mix for us for the full year, Jack, what I would tell you is you are probably looking at around 1.4 million tons of hot mix and ready mix probably around 0.5 million cubic yards.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Okay, and with regard to housing, which were obviously coming off of low base and there is something\u2019s that look better as we sit here today with regard to some activities starts and permits I guess multi-family. But are you guys seeing home builders start new subdivisions, which obviously also uses a lot of aggregate in terms of site development or we still putting out to some existing lots?","Howard Nye","Jack, I think the answer is yes. I think we are still putting housing on existing lots but we are now seeing some new subdivision work now granted it\u2019s not a lot but it is some activity now. And over the last couple of years there has really been no activity in that. And you nailed it and that is when you start seeing activity where it\u2019s a new subdivision we will truly be a leading indicator when that starts taking off I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s taking off but I\u2019m saying there is activity Jack.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Howard, do you think if we got a highway bill and you said that even if happened by the end of March it probably wouldn\u2019t affect your business till 2013 and I appreciate the lag there. But the market was down last year I think (Inaudible) is forecasting another down year this year, which is probably a good place to be without a highway bill I would say. But it was a high, getting a highway bill at a flat rate of funding strangely enough, enough to boost the market beyond, above where it\u2019s been you know slightly down.","Howard Nye","I think if you had a highway bill that was out there in multiyear I think the answer is yes and probably would Jack. Because in our view what\u2019s happening right now is states are simply unwilling to commit to multi-year projects and they are not willing to go forward under that basis. So I think even if we had something that was flat and obviously we would much rather see a higher bill number yet I think that\u2019s still helpful.","Now frankly, you\u2019ve been coming back and looking at what the house has proposed to address that for a second when you really look at what that bill has done to get rid of old redundant programs or what it\u2019s doing to give states unlimited authority to toll in the state highways and basically putting a faster delivery time out there. Now, I clearly do believe that a new bill would start to add the volume now granted.","Even when we go back and take a look at the way stimulus worked I think you can look at the stimulus program and use that as a bit of a guide on what\u2019s going to happen when we end up with new high way bill. And as you recall when stimulus came out you only saw around 21% of it go in 2009 and not surprisingly 2010 was a pretty big year when 43% of it went and again 2011 it\u2019s 22% feeling a lot like 2009 as did lot of things in this industry this year as in 14% next year so not a bad blueprint to use in the back of the mind as you think about a new highway bill.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Yeah, okay. Great, thanks a lot.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Jack.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hello Jerry.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Well towards the Specialty Products business can you talk about the timing of the kiln start up we will get any production contribution this year?","Howard Nye","No I wish we were but we are anticipating is having that done really at year end Jerry. So we will look to have incremental tonnage as we go into \u201913 that\u2019s going to be let\u2019s call it 275 thousand times.","Anne Lloyd","Hey Jerry, we\u2019ve indicated that it\u2019s probably around $22 million to $25 million that would step up in 2013.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Perfect. And in terms of your outlook and for flat Specialty Products earnings next year despite very favorable natural gas price. Any sort of headwinds that you should be thinking about or you leaving yourself somewhere in the case natural gas prices come back or steel get softer?","Howard Nye","No, I\u2019m sorry when steel is running at 75% like it did this year it works really well. Keep in mind nat gas doesn\u2019t matter a lot to that business nat gas probably 27%, electricity is around 27% and coal is around 26%, 27% so you really got a covey of energy items that can affect that business. Nat gas being down helps a lot but steel running anywhere north of 70 is really the single biggest driver right now.","Anne Lloyd","And that is the issue Jerry in our forward view on natural gas is that particularly the United States is going to be pretty stable so it\u2019s going to be steel utilization. And we are assuming that utilization runs about like it did this year, which is where you see the profitability because the business essentially is at capacity.","Howard Nye","Nice problem.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And can you talk about the CapEx versus volume guidance stripping out the Specialty Product capacity expansion. It looks like you are actually cutting core CapEx by I don\u2019t know what you call it 13 or so percent versus some pretty nice volume growth. Is there a difference in capital intensity between the asset swap or any other factors that are driving that?","Howard Nye","Not particularly if you go back and look at what I would tell you some growth projects this year there is probably somewhere around $63 million to $65 million. We usually have around $25 million in land that\u2019s usually a good solid place over. And if you come back and really break it down on mobile, plant and other it\u2019s probably around $67 million. And again that\u2019s clearly a rate below DD&A now that\u2019s running around $174 million a year.","But Jerry I think we can continue to do that when we are running at these types of volumes and keep in mind if you look at our CapEx profile and compare it to most in the sector we were investing in ourselves when others were trying to buy businesses at big EBITDAs and big multiples. So we feel like pulling back CapEx the way that we have right now is a) responsible but b) we believe we can do it and importantly do it safely.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And can you quantify the G&A opportunity you see in Denver perhaps elsewhere that current facilities are operating that and hopefully what time period do you think you can get them down to level that you see across your business.","Howard Nye","You know what the operations are up and down to truck range and that\u2019s clearly a business now we\u2019ve had under belt now for about a month and a half. So we are going to need a little bit more time with that Jerry before I give you any more specifics on it.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens Inc. Your line is open.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hi Trey.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","First off on the pricing guidance of 2% to 4% so coming off of the 6% and some of the other things in the quarter and some of the other things you\u2019ve talked about you anticipate the year kind of looking at 2012 do you anticipate the year is going to be more kind of front end loaded as it relates to pricing or more kind of even or how do you, how do you look on it think about that given the strength that you are coming off of 4Q.","Howard Nye","You know what I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think of it as just front end loaded. I think as we do watch some stimulus projects come out that clearly does help that. But at the same time I don\u2019t see that I see it really being fairly uniform traits around the year. That\u2019s how we would approach it.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Okay, secondly Anne on the business development expenses in the quarter can you give us kind of your expectation for additional expenses as we kind of go into first quarter and beyond.","Anne Lloyd","Obviously, we expect to incur some expenses the magnitude of that will depend on how long we continue to process. So we will have to tell you that when the quarter ends.","Howard Nye","Yeah, Trey, a couple of things to keep in mind. We do have a trial that\u2019s coming up at the end of February and in early March and as you look at the charges that went in there for last year, some of that were very discrete fees that were paid specifically to the bankers and their fees going forward are more success driven. But with that said we are not going to start a process that we are not prepared to finish.","We don\u2019t think spending that type of money is best use of our money or best use of Vulcan\u2019s money and obviously we very much want to sit down in a room and have a meaningful dialogue. But I think right now it\u2019s hard to come back and really put a nail on what those costs will be.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Okay I understand that. Okay, and then last one again it\u2019s for Anne on the gain on the discontinued operations in the quarter could you give us some color on what all of that consisted our fleet?","Anne Lloyd","The biggest issues there and you had a write off of your asset and it\u2019s from the river business then you got new assets from Lafarge and then you wrote off about $10 million of net goodwill that you had to recognize there and it ended up being $10 million gain on that sale.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","$10 million pretax gain okay. Thank you very much.","Howard Nye","Yes, you are seeing a tax effective numbers on the base of the financial statements.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Right got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rodny Nacier from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi Howard and Anne.","Howard Nye","Hi, Rodny.","Anne Lloyd","Hi, Rodny.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks for the update on federal transportation spending. You had mentioned a hypothetical long-term bill back in the first half of \u201912 will benefit \u201912 results. Should we generally anticipate a nine month lag between the finalized bill and a trickle down to aggregate demand?","Howard Nye","You know what Rodny, that\u2019s probably not a bad way to think about it. Obviously you can certainly have seasonality to be built into that naturally anyway. But I wouldn\u2019t persuade you from looking at it in that way.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. And with the likely mix shift from asphalt to more concrete intensive projects, can you give out an estimate of aggregate demand for 1 billion of repaving activity versus a billion for road widening and extending?","Howard Nye","You know what, if you are building new roads, Rodny, it\u2019s around 32,000 tons per lane mile when you are building a brand new road.","Anne Lloyd","It\u2019s regardless really of.","Howard Nye","Yeah, that\u2019s from the ground up. Obviously aggregate is, it\u2019s more aggregate intensive in asphalt than in concrete if you are looking at something in the mid 90s versus something in the mid 80s related to concrete. I\u2019m not sure you would see a remarkable shift more to concrete I suppose to asphalt under any circumstances and clearly right now where you have more repaving you will obviously see more asphalt right now. But at the same time now there are differences in cost as well and state DOT is pretty sensitive to that. So I\u2019m not sure we will see a remarkable shift but I hope that help remind your question a little bit.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Yeah, you are talking about the shift in your demand or the shift in growth expanding activities versus repaving?","Howard Nye","You know what I\u2019m not sure that it would change our demand outlook very much Rodny and that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on right now.","Anne Lloyd","If you would have perhaps a better cash flow impact if you add new construction. It might not change demand it might change the nature of the demand we are just going to use front based products clean stone a little bit more in the road construction I suppose to just clean stone in the asphalt resurfacing.","Howard Nye","Primary thing we would do Rodny we would do is come back and address inventories in a very productive way and it would let us run our plants in a more wide open fashion right now, which is not where we have been to for quite a while.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Understood. And with the asset side can you remind me how many times we\u2019ve gained in Denver and how many times we have divested along the Mississippi?","Howard Nye","As I said, I think if you go and take a look at what the aggregate tonnage acquired over the last part of the year would be going into the New Year it\u2019s going to be worth around 8 million tons. I think what you will see going out at river it\u2019s probably going to be somewhere close to 7, 7.5.","Anne Lloyd","Yeah, Rodny you will see that in page 14 of the disclosures in the press release. You will see the divested tonnage we break those out for you.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, thank you guys.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Rodny.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust","You and the checks on your guidance for next year you talk about the energy that\u2019s precisely necessarily South Texas business you referred to earlier in the call.","Howard Nye","You know what South Texas is clearly a big heap of it if you look at what the energy business and in that term right now what shale meant to us in 2011. We had around 4.2 million tons of material that went to shale all by itself and to give you a sense of what we saw in South Texas that we went back and looked at Eagle Ford in 2010 it was somewhere just shy of 0.5 million ton this past year somewhere just over 1 million tons.","And as where you look at what we do like it\u2019s going to be going into 2012 that deposit all by itself we think it\u2019s going to be around 1.7. But we also see activity in the Barnett and the Haynesville, some in the Marcella, some even up into the Bakken. So when we talk about energy shale is the big piece of that. The other piece that we believe more of as we go into \u201912 then we saw in \u201911 will be in wind farms as well. Keep in mind we\u2019ve got nice presence obviously in Texas and Iowa and those are awfully big on the wind farm producing side as well.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust","So if we added all up what is energy as we end the year as a percentage of your tonnage, your total tonnage?","Howard Nye","If we looked at that if we said that the shale was around 4.8 million tons and we came back and said maybe the balance of it might be another couple or more right now you can go back and do your math on that but you probably wouldn\u2019t be far off on that.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust","Alright, thank you.","Howard Nye","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. May be just wanted another limited questions we can ask about essential transaction. But with that said, what steps can you discuss from an operational stand point can you say to pave the way for potential combination with Martin and Vulcan. But in that regard, are you doing anything differently now that you can discuss?","Howard Nye","The primary thing that we are doing with our business Kathryn is we operate it with safety first and cost right behind that. And we are focused on absolutely positively running as efficiently as we can because we have a business that we are proud of it in this respect, you come through as you did in\u201911 watching volumes down, watching energy up and still putting up numbers that I think we are very proud out and then I believe our shareholders are proud of. Our primary focus is making sure that we do that and we do it even better in \u201912 and we are obviously in a view we can do even better than that with a broader footprint. But our primary operating focus right now is keeping our eye on Martin Marietta.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Okay, keep in mind we\u2019ve gotten some few facts on basically the materials and building products company they benefited from milder weather in the fourth quarter particularly in December and November and that is carried into the year. To what extent do volumes help out at all in Q4 and what are the potential benefits just going into the New Year?","Howard Nye","Part of what it did is it did let us put some inventories in the ground in some parts of the country that we needed to in the fourth quarter, where often times you wouldn\u2019t be able to. If you looked at volume trends through the fourth quarter volume is actually down in October, down in November and actually up in December. So that very much ties with what you saw Kathryn. It also tended to be relatively dry in some parts of the country as well that was helpful.","I think one of the big deltas that we saw in Q4 this year as compared to Q4 last year we still had a good agg line season but agg line volumes this year was still around 17% lighter than they were last year. I think one thing that people shouldn\u2019t be fooled by when you have this nice warm weather in parts of the country don\u2019t feel that you, there is a lot of D&T work that\u2019s going on.","Keep in mind, if you go to the standard state of North Carolina is a great example. When you got to mid November the standard specification that you basically say you have a time extension on any contracts that you have with DOT through March 15 next year. So what you have is the usual remarkable demobilization of construction equipment on jobs. So even if you\u2019ve got a week or 10 days of very nice weather contractors typically will not bring their people back from lay off, they will not demobilize their equipment, they won\u2019t put them on the job because it\u2019s just not a very efficient way to run. So I think there might be one or two halts Kathryn that this warmer weather will help but in large part those are anomalies not the rule right now.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Now on the other non-res side of construction Anne as you commented earlier about residential (Inaudible) family but what is a greater driver right now of the residential multi-family or a traditional single family housing. What also I think you get some color in terms of years that you know what inning we are in terms of this multi-family build out.","Howard Nye","And what right now what I would tell you is there is more multi-family activity than there is single family activity although there are areas that we are seeing increasing single family activity. With respect to, that\u2019s a great question on where we are at the game so I guess we are, we just finished Super Bowl so we are talking baseball terms.","Yeah, Kathryn I would tell you, we are somewhere in the middle of the game right now on that. Clearly, housing still has uptime still ahead of it until people can sell homes or get financing they are not going to build new homes and I would say, we are probably looking at five year period of time to really see that turn in some respect. And that\u2019s where it sits, you are going to see more multi-family activity during that snapshot than you will on the single family activity side.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Great on your CapEx can you give some commentary on contribution with the mobile equipment as meaning kind of continue bouncing on the bottom. Are you taking any difference approach on either how you utilize equipment or how you kind of outsourcing equipment for instance with fixed rental versus outright purchase or any different strategies today that you would have taken five or six years ago with managing mobile equipment.","Howard Nye","The primary thing that\u2019s different on mobile equipment is a) you are not putting as much hours on all of it and the beautiful thing is, it is mobile so you do you have the ability to move it from operations that may not be as good to other happens that have the need. So simply making your mobile equipment mobile and feeling free to move it between districts between divisions or otherwise it\u2019s an important piece of it. I don\u2019t think the lease analysis or the purchase analysis as for say change I just think the need is changed.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Okay, and finally and just a quick clarification on SG&A have you assuming flat year-over-year on a percentage basis in percentage of sales or on the dollars?","Anne Lloyd","It will be on a dollar basis for the heritage basis.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","For the heritage business? Okay, great. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you. I was curious with your South East region given the river divestitures with the impact there be changed with the operating margin or would it just be a lower dollar contribution to the overall company margin.","Howard Nye","You know what you won\u2019t see that much of a difference in the South East in large part because the volume there has just been in many respect God if you really think about what that South East is for us right now it\u2019s North Georgia where I think in many respects we were searching for bottom throughout the year. I hope we found it on volume.","Alabama has been a very difficult market as well. Hardly enough the one market that we saw actually very steady march improvement on volumes throughout the year was actually Florida and we are actually start increased pricing in Florida throughout the year. But the balance of the markets in the South East are just at a point that the company fixed costs around 90% of what you got there right now I mean Adam I\u2019m sorry.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo","And my second question goes back to the earlier dialogue about on the highway bill, pretend we\u2019ve got waved your magic wand you got a $15 billion six year bill how much do you think it will get back to you, how much of it circle down to an annual basis.","Howard Nye","Well that\u2019s a nice thing to sit back.","Anne Lloyd","It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had that kind of debate.","Howard Nye","You know what if you go.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo","I will pick you another, I will pick a different number.","Howard Nye","But I mean if you go to a fully robust bill and you assume there is good solid transportation activity what I will do is take you back to a 2006 timeframe where you had good infrastructure activity, you had good commercial activity, not great but good. You had really red hot housing activity and pretty steady ChemRock and rail activity. I think if you are more normalized that you are probably into 185, 190ish volumes based on what would have been a heritage snapshot here in our rear view mirror, I think that\u2019s probably not a bad way to look at it.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Howard Nye","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Levin from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Scott Levin \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hi, Scott.","Scott Levin \u2013 JP Morgan","I was keen the residential breakdown question definitely I think you said that your multi-family activity was higher than what you are seeing in single family side. If we think about normal times, what if that split tends to look at over very, very long period of time. If you get a sense of how below trends we are in the single family side right now.","Howard Nye","You can put it ordinarily you would see a much bigger component than single family than multi particularly in South East and South West. I mean right now if you take a look at the types of numbers that are out there I mean you are almost seeing something based on the pure history that we\u2019ve seen, something that\u2019s been three times on multi-family, the res write down I think that\u2019s almost an inverse.","Scott Levin \u2013 JP Morgan","Got it and then not to beat Howard exactly.","Howard Nye","I will go at it.","Scott Levin \u2013 JP Morgan","It sounds like you really think if you don\u2019t get one by the time the current extension expires don\u2019t bank on it. Is there a realistic possibility maybe we get extended once in your view to the, one of the summer holidays to buy a little bit more time before throwing in the towel on this. If we don\u2019t see anything by the end of March we just not expect anything or are you not expecting anything you know at that point for the rest of the year?","Howard Nye","I will tell you Scott others may disagree with me on this I guess my sense is that if we don\u2019t have it by the time the first ER expires Presidential politics aren\u2019t just so powerful for the rest of the year. I think in perhaps any other year than this maybe you can see what you are describing. But I think it\u2019s the house and the senate can get it all together here over the next call at 45ish days. Realistically we are probably looking to see our year and as a practical matter that\u2019s where we thought we would be. I mean if you go back and listen to these calls for the last couple of years, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent saying that we thought we would probably not see any multi-year highway bill until after the election. I hope I\u2019m wrong but I think that\u2019s probably where we are.","Scott Levin \u2013 JP Morgan","Got it. Maybe one follow up on that you know from the point at which we got initial proposal out of the house, which again was down 30% plus. Are you encouraged by what you are seeing out of the hill and you know what surprised you pleasantly or would that be overstating things.","Howard Nye","No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s overstating things. I think that\u2019s fair and actually the different correlations who have looked at expedition spending and have really good advocates for it have a lot to do with that. I mean if you look at the dialogue that\u2019s coming out right now, there is good dialogue coming out of the White House, there is more better dialog coming out of the house. And the senate has been very consistent on it, look at where the senate is it came out of committee with a high policy 18 to zero vote.","So we like the time of dialogue, we like the fact that we are not hearing any of that 30% cut language anymore. So I think as we look at where we sit and what we are likely to get would we like higher numbers, sure we would. Are we at least pleased that it looks like it\u2019s staying flat? We are and are we particularly pleased with the reform provisions that we see out of the house? We are. So I don\u2019t think your notion of feeling better about it is misplaced at all I would agree with you.","Scott Levin \u2013 JP Morgan","Understood. Thanks a lot.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Thank you. I just have a clarification question on your placing guidance. Howard you stated in your prepared remarks that you expected pricing to be steady in 2012 if I heard you correctly just want to reconcile that with the 2% to 4% guidance. The steady commentary respect of the pricing mix was a result of the other slots and gains in the last quarter.","Howard Nye","I think what we are more saying to that we finished this year with pricing up 2.7%. So when we were saying steady we meant we should continue to see that same level of trajectory. So perhaps I needed to retain my words a little bit more and I\u2019m sorry about that Garik but that\u2019s what I meant to say.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, so thanks for clarifying that. And just switching gears to non-res you talked about your expected growth with some of the energy markets. Can you talk about what you are seeing on the lighter side of the equation of this retail if you are expecting any volume pick up in those areas?","Howard Nye","You know what Garik we are expecting some pick up in those areas this year. We started seeing some pick up in that last year and again it\u2019s not tremendous uptick and I think as we discussed before that you should see us going to follow residential is something that feels like a nine to 18 month lag. So on some of those places where we are starting to see some residential activity I think we will see some office and retail more of what we\u2019ve seen so far. There is people coming in and finishing office and retail projects that were started several years ago and then they walked away from it and put it on ice.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, and then a question just on the (Inaudible) volume performance in the quarter. Was the year-over-year drop was largely related to the decline that you mentioned ChemRock in 4Q.","Howard Nye","Yeah, it was. We saw the ChemRock\/Rail piece yes I think will sit down and down 17% and we saw some of the rail business down as well.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","So if you hold that out would you gotten across the volumes to grow the Western Group.","Howard Nye","Yeah, I think you would have seen something positive considerably much better.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay and then just lastly to the degree you can answer this. Can you provide an update with respect to the DOJ chase I can request and perhaps what we made expected ruling from them.","Howard Nye","You know I probably can\u2019t give you anything on their timing what I can tell you is we did follow (Inaudible) obviously the week that we initiated our offer. We have worked as we typically do at DOJ our practice has been to work very openly, very collaboratively with them and we feel like working in that type of a process leads to a quicker more thoughtful conclusion. And that\u2019s exactly where we are we haven\u2019t been surprised by anything and we continue to feel very good about the process.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thank you very much.","Howard Nye","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Hey guys how are you doing?","Howard Nye","Alright Ted, how are you?","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Great, quick questions and you\u2019ve been kind enough to kind of bridge the cost of sales if you will for the aggregate business for us in prior quarters. And so if we could do that in the fourth quarter and really where we are going just trying to bridge on a reported basis revenue up $21 million and as we think about, we think your current profit is down about 5.5 in the back half of one time, which is 26% decremented. I know that Howard has highlighted $19 million of higher energy cost. But I\u2019m just wondering if he could help us reconcile pricing with the $16 million tail wind or something there kind of how you get through pricing, volume, labor, energy et cetera.","Anne Lloyd","If you look at the fourth quarter on consolidated basis growth profit you are right pricing was up about $17 million. Volume and energy cost you about $3.5 million each and the other big driver was your inventory change that cost you about $7.8 million.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay.","Anne Lloyd","And it\u2019s on the growth profit line.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay, gross.","Anne Lloyd","Yeah.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay, and then can we do the same thing for the Specialty Product business because 82% incremental is very impressive. I couldn\u2019t tell if Howard might have mentioned before that energy was not benefited I guess that kind of control for it the press used to say the one to help. Maybe you can just help us bridge kind of what happened in the fourth quarter especially products that will be great too.","Anne Lloyd","I don\u2019t have that bridge we typically don\u2019t provide that level of detail. Energy natural gas was not, it was essentially neutral in the quarter. The biggest energy issue at mag or Specialty Products is the (Inaudible) that they have to use call there but demand was up, pricing was up, but typically we did not provided that level of detail on a bridge Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay, could you get an order of magnitude of what pricing did for Specialty Products or is that nothing you want to disclose?","Howard Nye","You know what Ted, Ted that is something that we don\u2019t want to disclose at this time.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Well, I just wanted to ask you on the vision on Specialty Product as they assume they basically add capacity at this point.","Howard Nye","Yeah. I think that\u2019s a very fair assumption.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay, so just trying to reconcile flat profits next year, I assume you\u2019ve got a meaningful degree of pricing power would you get natural gas curve is not going to be a headwind for you. Trying to understand how we should think about flat profit guidance for that segment given those dynamics and as it one of those where we should anticipate shifted revenue for some reason or if you could just elaborate there it would be great.","Anne Lloyd","It\u2019s all back to the field utilization Ted. I mean we are using field utilization for \u201912 as the same as it was in \u201911, which is what current indications are. If that number, if utilization is higher, you can expect higher profitability, if it\u2019s lower you can expect lower profitability again that\u2019s against the 2011 benchmark.","Howard Nye","So again, keep in mind Ted watch it the way it goes around 70 if it goes above 70 it does really well but if it\u2019s below that or near it suffer.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Is there any pricing assumption positive pricing assumption built into that guidance flat kind of pretax contribution.","Howard Nye","We received our normal price increases in that segment. But again we don\u2019t come back and address on the percentage basis what that is.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Got it, okay. Got it, thanks a lot guys let\u2019s rock this quarter.","Howard Nye","Thanks Ted.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC. Your line is open.","Bob Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital","Hi, thanks for the terrific color. You\u2019ve done a great job of managing SG&A. I was just curious how much of an opportunity is there moving forward especially at times like you might be growing your revenue base. Can we keep that at the 125 range or is there any chance you have additional cost saving opportunities.","Howard Nye","Guess what we are always going to look for additional cost saving opportunities. We will leave it at that. So we continue to look at it I do think we manage SG&A better than the most in the sector and we are obviously very proud of it but at the same time 25% of your cost of goods sold is on the personnel line and that\u2019s always going to be something in a volume challenged time. That we are going to be sensitive too again I\u2019m proud of that and our team should be proud of that that in type of an atmosphere they can put up these type of numbers and in large part it\u2019s great to have 6% pricing in the quarter, I won\u2019t deny that but if you don\u2019t have your cost profile in place none of the rest of it matters.","Anne Lloyd","And Bob we do have some pension headwind in 2012 that we are going to have to overcome obviously asset returns were not very good for 2011. So that pension increased for 12 and it\u2019s about $9 million and about third of that goes to SG&A.","Bob Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital","That\u2019s really helpful color. On the diesel cost are you guys hedging and what are diesel prices since the start of the year on average.","Howard Nye","Well you know we don\u2019t hedge these so what I could give you a sense of when we finish the fourth quarter diesel was around $2.95 a gallon that was up 27% from the prior year quarter when he said 2.32 for the full year. And this number is very similar to fourth quarter; it\u2019s $2.96 per gallon, so there is your 40% delta year-on-year. If you are looking for what you meant for the quarter it\u2019s about $0.05 of share that\u2019s diluted for the full year of $0.23 and if you are looking for total usage in Q4 it was just shy of 7 million gallons and for the full year just shy of 30 million gallons.","Bob Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital","That\u2019s fine.","Howard Nye","That\u2019s probably more than you ever wanted to know.","Bob Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital","No and that\u2019s great that\u2019s exactly what I was trying to figure out. And just in terms of your offer to combine with VMC. I was trying to get to understand better how you give out the proxy process. Because one thing VMC has been saying is that even if you\u2019ve been able to get your nominees on the board you would have 5 out of 12 on VMC\u2019s Board of Directors. So if that mean if you did get that then you would wait around the fall year when you get the full board on your side. Am I thinking about that correctly?","Howard Nye","I mean, I think if you are looking at a pure process I think you are thinking about it correctly and I think one of the things that we said in one of the last calls is we are not looking to start something, we are not prepared to finish. Again the process that you outlined is not the process that we want to do.","I mean what we want to do is we want to sit down with them and we want to negotiate with this current management team with that current board and find a way to bring these companies together in a very productive way that gained some media shareholder value. But through your question from a process perspective if that doesn\u2019t occur then I don\u2019t discrete I think you hit it.","Bob Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital","And you\u2019ve prepared then to wait the extra year is what you are saying.","Howard Nye","We are prepared to do what we need to do.","Bob Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital","Thanks very much. Nice quarter.","Howard Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Brent Thielman \u2013 D.A. Davidson","Hey, Howard; hey, Anna. Just a quick question on the South East Group. Howard you mentioned for this ongoing weakness in North Georgia and Alabama markets and obviously the diesel is having to have a broad impact. But we should say those areas that principally would keep you from getting the profitability in that group or it\u2019s a little more Q&A.","Howard Nye","I would say that, that is very much if you look at housing and his landing in particular it is just frankly it\u2019s almost non-existent as is commercial work there. Georgia DOT has been through its own political imaginations here over the last several years as well. It looks like a lot of that is going to get so forth dealt with the ballet bill issue that\u2019s going to be up there in July as we go into this year. But clearly the underlying economies in North Georgia, Alabama and to a degree but not as too much in South Georgia has been the primary drivers no doubt about it.","Anne Lloyd","And Brent we are at a point at some of those litigations where either you are open or you are closed. And so if you are open you are running at probably above 80%, 85% fixed cost. It\u2019s just a tough climate.","Brent Thielman \u2013 D.A. Davidson","Okay, great. Well thanks for all the color in the call.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Brent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Betts from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Yes, good afternoon. Just one question I guess it\u2019s two parts for me if I could 1% increase in direct product cost 9.5% in cost of goods sold I mean these are all the detail I think three months ago two part question if I could maybe on first of the 305 in Q4 how much of that is defined into direct production cost and the second part of the question as we go into 2012 you talked about still declining direct product cost. What is that you need to close that gap you didn\u2019t know around where will be the fuel prices. I mean obviously I\u2019m talking with volumes roughly the same talking about 3% to 4% increase. But it\u2019s the major difference that it caused by energy or am I missing something there? Thank you.","Howard Nye","No, you are not missing anything there. Anne will come back and address the first part of it. But from where we sit to answer your question directly one it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve (Inaudible) that\u2019s your number one driver and then two coming back and having some degree of stability or normal seat related to the energy component in mind.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you and Anne.","Anne Lloyd","I will get right now.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Well maybe I just add one more to Howard then have you expanded the asphalt that situation more of a concern. I mean significant types of that on the asphalt side.","Howard Nye","You know what I think what that\u2019s going to asphalt typically is either going to made or otherwise depending on how the liquid is moving. I think what\u2019s going to happen next year is you will go into the year recognize that you\u2019ve gotten much more stable situation in liquid. You know keep in mind even when I address that $19.2 million delta in the West Group that we talked about on energy full 9 plus of that is simply related to liquid. So as you go back you have indexing in the contracts and you have the ability to capturing those issues moving to New Year. As I don\u2019t see that being as volatile in \u201912 as it was in \u201911. Simply press the energy spike and the liquid spike it was so remarkable during the course of the year.","Anne Lloyd","And my total cost of goods sold for the quarter about two thirds of that are direct.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you both.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Johnson from Morgan Keegan. Your line is open.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Well good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hey, Keith.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Just a couple of quick questions. I guess first of all on the guidance for interest I think you guys said flat in 2012 versus 2011. It looks like in your call sort of brought down into this $13 million range after the first quarter this year. Do you expect maybe a little pick up a little bit in 2012?","Anne Lloyd","Well we had a little pick up in debt because of the cash payment that we\u2019ve made for our acquisition that we did in the fourth quarter. And obviously we\u2019ve got perhaps a little bit of (Inaudible) to fund the cost of project here.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Okay and then if we look at the fourth quarter taxes I guess, of course dropped off a little bit. But that\u2019s all swap related and what happened fourth quarter on the income tax line.","Anne Lloyd","Fourth quarter taxes are very strange discontinued ops happened but it\u2019s really, but it\u2019s been biggest driver for the fourth quarter was continuing now. And that has to do with the fact that your business development expenses were not deductable.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Okay, now it\u2019s just play out quarter-to-quarter.","Anne Lloyd","That just pay out as with the resolution that our business development activity.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","But otherwise, just running into 26% annual rate.","Anne Lloyd","That otherwise without this three other unusual advantages.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Okay, I apologize if I missed it earlier. For 2011 can you tell me what the infrastructure heritage volume and then the non-res heritage volume as they were related to 2010?","Howard Nye","If we looked at infrastructure for the quarter was down 1.7. Non-res was up slightly. ChemRock\/Rail was off around 4.5 and res was up around 2.5. If you looked at it for a full year infrastructure down around a little bit more than 5, non-res of around 3.5, ChemRock\/Rail off around 1.7 and res up around 3.7.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","And then I guess just final question you\u2019ve mentioned about the seasonality short of shifting with this asset swap. Because the portion of your business is now more to the West is that, should we just think about that particularly on the West segment as we kind of bottomed out first quarter and going forward with more of a presence in the Denver operation.","Howard Nye","Absolutely you should I mean it\u2019s going to be. It is the winner operation and introduce some of our friends to the notion of when to (Inaudible) and that large part of that\u2019s what you are doing with the winner operation in Colorado you are a winner in that and give you a sense that if you simply look at it from a headcount perspective.","The operations that went out to the operations that we brought it our net headcount is stuck around 463 people. And again if you are back to the notion that\u2019s the most expensive cost that you have is the personal component of it and you are entirely right I\u2019m back and look at that with very much with winner focus here during the balance of Q1.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","And my final question is that any portion of that fourth quarter drop off in the West in the gross margin lines because of the swap happened and that\u2019s the fact during extension.","Howard Nye","No, I mean to the extent of that was there we just, a little bit of invoice nothing above that.","Keith Johnson \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Okay. All right, great. Thanks a lot.","Howard Nye","Alright, thank you.","Operator","I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Howard Nye for brief closing remarks.","Howard Nye","Again, thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta. 2011 was a notable year from a lot of perspectives. We think the stage is set for a very exciting 2012. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2012 results in May and updating you as appropriate on our strategic initiatives. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As announced in this morning's release, our second quarter results reflect continued solid performance and disciplined execution against stated objectives, controlling those things that we can and dealing effectively with those circumstances over which we have no control, such as extraordinary weather conditions. I'll touch upon that later, but let me first initially discuss our results.","Strong pricing, cost reductions in our heritage business, coupled with continued synergy realization and profit contributions from the acquired businesses, drove record net sales and record earnings from operations as well as a 100-basis point expansion in our consolidated gross margin. In fact, significantly improved gross margin in all heritage aggregates reportable segments led to incremental gross margin contributions well above our stated objectives.","Remarkably, these results were achieved despite those things we cannot control, principally historic levels of rainfall throughout the United States and particularly in Texas. In short, we believe these weather patterns reduced second quarter consolidated gross profit by nearly $40 million. We feel it's important that we provide some perspective on these weather challenges, not in an effort to simply state the obvious, that indeed our second quarter results could have been stronger, but rather, so you can more fully evaluate our results and get a clear picture of our earnings potential.","That said, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, has tracked participation levels for 121 years. For that period, the second quarter of 2015 was the second wettest for the entire United States. Focusing solely on the state of Texas, NOAA reported the second quarter as well as the first six months of the year were the wettest ever recorded. Contextually, Dallas, Houston and Austin experienced rainfall in May alone of 17, 14 and 17.5 inches respectively. To put this amount of monthly rainfall in perspective, The Washington Post reported that the water that flowed into Texas reservoirs alone, a tremendous 8 million acre-feet, would be enough to meet New York City's water needs for seven years.","Beyond Texas and the impact on the Southwest in cement divisions, five additional key states had their top 10 wettest second quarters ever recorded, impacting both sales and productivity in our Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Mideast divisions. We estimate nearly 3 million tons of aggregates, with 1.8 million tons in Texas alone, 450,000 cubic yards of ready-mix concrete and 215,000 tons of cement shipments were deferred to later in the year and into 2016 as a result of weather. Notwithstanding the significant weather impact during the first half of 2015, we believe underlying demand for our products remains strong, driven by steady ongoing economic recovery and we fully expect to capture delayed business in the last half of the year and into 2016, assuming more normal weather patterns.","This morning's release also contained important strategic and shareholder value-enhancing developments related to our TXI acquisition. First, we were pleased to once again raise our annual synergy guidance to $120 million by the end of 2016, more than 70% above our initial estimate at the acquisition date a little over a year ago. Second, we signed the definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which we expect to close later this quarter. We intend to use the proceeds from this divestiture to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under a program initiated during the second quarter.","Before we discuss second quarter results further, please be reminded that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of weather patterns, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise.","We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","To provide transparency into our second quarter results, I'll discuss the heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business and two other small aggregates product line transactions completed during the year's first quarter. While it's currently important to understand the results of heritage versus acquired operations, this comparison is becoming increasingly less meaningful as we successfully complete the integration of TXI operations into our heritage business.","In addition, to facilitate this discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. We believe doing so provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance. Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the heritage business.","Slide three provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the heritage aggregates business. We're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company. When evaluating aggregates product line volume variances, it's important to note that the prior-year second quarter includes shipments from three facilities in the West Group, a quarry in Oklahoma and two related sales distribution yards that were divested in the third quarter of 2014.","Consequently, to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these three locations should be excluded from the prior-year quarter. After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were down 3%, while shipments for the heritage aggregates business increased slightly. Both of these metrics were negatively impacted by excessive rainfall during the second quarter, meaningfully impacting the West Group and also the Mid-America Group.","Slide four presents gross margin by product line for acquired operations. In addition to delayed shipments, profitability for these product lines was also negatively affected by weather, which resulted in lower production and efficiency levels. Heritage aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end use market accounted for approximately 43% of total shipments and declined 3.6% compared with the prior-year quarter. This decline is attributable to the impact of wet weather and to a lesser degree, uncertainty regarding the Federal Highway Trust Fund.","We continue to see state-level funding initiatives come to fruition in numerous states, a sign of pent-up demand. Texas leads the nation in highway contract awards and expects to let nearly $7.5 billion in fiscal 2015. In November, Texas voters will decide on Proposition 7, a ballot initiative that would dedicate an incremental $2.5 billion of revenue from the sales and use tax annually for the State Highway Fund beginning September 1, 2017. Given our significant existing backlog, we anticipate Texas infrastructure shipments to report growth over the next several years.","Major project activity is also accelerating in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, with all three states along with Texas being actively engaged in TIFIA-funded projects. Each of these states continues to be among the top states in the country for employment growth, a catalyst for construction activity. Further, we believe the recently passed funding initiatives in Georgia and Iowa will have a meaningful long-term impact on infrastructure activity in both states.","Recently, both houses of Congress passed, and the President signed, a continuing resolution, extending the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21, through October 29, 2015. During this period of extended funding, we expect Congress to work toward passage of a new multi-year bill. There's broad bipartisan support and recognition of the importance of long-term investment in our nation's infrastructure. These include discussions between Congress and the White House, evaluating whether a reduced income tax rate or other incentive for multinational companies to repatriate earnings, could provide a source of funding for a long-term federal highway bill.","We believe the Senate's proposed six-year highway bill will likely provide the framework for broader congressional debate following the August recess. We and others have long believed that the passage of a long-term infrastructure program for our nation is a top priority. It's gratifying to see the Congress and the President seem to be moving along a path that will provide our citizens with legislation that will accomplish a goal that most Americans consider to be critical to our quality of life.","The non-residential end use market is comprised of two components, light and heavy. The light non-residential component is primarily office and retail, and demand in this area is generally tied more directly to employment growth and residential demand. We expect light non-residential-related volumes to continue to increase, driven by improved economic fundamentals, which is coinciding with some of the reemergence of speculative construction activity.","The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy. The heavy non-residential end use market represented 22% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes and declined 11%. However, we believe this decline is driven in part by weather and expect to recoup the delayed volumes within 12 months. As expected, shale energy-related volumes have declined versus the prior year quarter, but are believed to be stabilizing. We continue to expect energy-related construction activity to remain strong, notably along the Gulf Coast.","As one example, the Port of Corpus Christi continues to prepare for long-term energy activity. Of note, a port official indicated the decline in oil prices has not reduced either the output of oil in Texas or the volumes transported via the port. Overall, United States crude oil production is projected to reach 9.5 million barrels per day in 2015, an increase of 800,000 barrels per day over 2014 levels.","In summary, we believe underlying non-residential demand continues to strengthen, as starts for the nation are up 12% over the trailing 12 months ended June 2015. Texas continues to lead the nation with growth of $6.5 billion or 19% for the same period. Additionally, non-building construction activity, most notably related to liquefied natural gas products, is up over $30 billion nationally, including more than $18 billion in Texas.","The residential end use market represented 16% of heritage aggregates shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior-year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth continues to be relatively consistent with the trend in housing starts. Texas, Florida and Georgia lead the nation in single-family unit starts, each with nearly double-digit growth for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015.","Finally, to conclude the discussion of end use markets for the second quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 9% of our second quarter heritage aggregates volume. Shipments were down slightly, primarily related to excessive rainfall in Colorado and Iowa.","Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 7.6% over the prior-year quarter, led by the West Group. We view this level of continued strength in aggregates product line pricing as an indication of underlying product demand and increased contractor confidence. Heritage aggregates product line total production costs were negatively affected by weather-related inefficiencies. The resulting decrease in operating leverage led to a 3% increase in cost per ton shipped. We continue to benefit from decline in diesel prices and on average paid $2.12 per gallon compared with $3.13 in the prior-year quarter, resulting in a $9 million reduction in diesel fuel costs for the heritage business.","The heritage aggregates-related downstream product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3.5 million. Notably, the heritage ready mixed concrete product line reported a 10% increase in average selling price. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $33 million and was 26% of net sales, an improvement of 530 basis points over the prior-year quarter.","All reportable segments expanded their respective gross margin, led by an increase of 810 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement. Our heritage aggregates business generated an incremental gross margin of 214%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. We expect further economic recovery in the Southeastern United States to provide continued margin expansion.","The Magnesia Specialties business delivered strong performance and generated net sales of $60.5 million and a gross margin of 35.1%. For the quarter, the business' earnings from operations were $18.8 million. Net sales and earnings were negatively affected by a decline in domestic steel production and the timing of typical maintenance costs.","Slides four and five provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the second quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of $36 million on external shipments of 2.8 million tons. Average selling price was $13.52 per ton, reflecting a product mix skewed by standing gravel as well as rail yard shipments.","The acquired ready-mix concrete business shipped 1.1 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $86.80. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected the business and reduced the profitability by an estimated $9 million.","The cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets, where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. Second quarter operating results were also negatively affected by wet weather, which delayed some shipments through the balance of the year and into 2016. For the second quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers at an average selling price of $98.86 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $100 million. The business achieved a gross margin of over 30% after incurring almost $6 million of planned kiln maintenance costs. We announced price increases effective April 1. However, there is a lag time before we realize the full benefit.","Our consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses were 6.7% of net sales, an increase of 60 basis points. This reflects the impact of weather-driven lower net sales and higher pension expense. We incurred net acquisition-related expenses of $2.1 million, in line with our estimated run rate for the next few quarters.","As detailed on slide six, our consolidated earnings from operations for the second quarter of $137 million improved more than $40 million from the prior-year earnings of $96 million. Our employees continued to work diligently on maximizing the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. In that regard, as previously noted, we now expect annual synergies to reach $120 million by the end of next year. Consistent with our integration plan, we completed the remaining systems integration for the cement and ready mixed concrete businesses during the second quarter, and I do want to thank our employees for their commitment to and patience with that process.","For the first half of the year, we generated $127 million of operating cash flow compared with $70 million for 2014, efficiently converting increased earnings into cash. As planned, we increased our organic capital investment, including continued work on the Medina limestone rail quarry near San Antonio, a strategic project we believe will be substantially complete by year-end. Further, during the first half of the year, we returned $154 million to our shareholders, both through the repurchase of 670,000 shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder, we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Also, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended June 2015 was 2.4 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant and within our targeted range.","In this morning's press release, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our California cement business, which is consistent with our strategic observations and timeframe when we acquired TXI. Our Oro Grande cement plant in Southern California is a state-of-the-art facility operated by a talented and committed workforce. However, the plant and its two related distribution terminals are neither proximate to other Martin Marietta core assets, nor complemented by downstream operations in California's traditionally vertically-integrated marketplace. Thus, after careful consideration and evaluation, we determined the best avenue to maximize shareholder value is to sell these operations. The sales price is $420 million, and as previously mentioned, we intend to use the proceeds to repurchase additional shares of our common stock.","Looking ahead to our full-year guidance, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue, and importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate, fueling an emerging construction recovery. During the second half of the year, we anticipate capturing a significant amount of weather-delayed shipments from the first half of the year. However, market capacity constraints will shift some of the delayed project activity into 2016. Accordingly, we modified our guidance to reflect this shift as well as the pending sale of the California cement operations.","Currently, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 7% to 10% over 2014, with 3% to 5% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregates product line production cost per ton is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014.","On a consolidated basis, we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, or EBITDA, ranging from $810 million to $850 million, with the change from prior quarter's guidance directly related to weather-deferred profitability and the planned California divestiture.","To conclude, we continue to be very excited about the future of Martin Marietta, which by virtually any measure, reflects a very positive growth trajectory. We believe the economy is in a construction-centric phase in both the residential and non-residential sectors, and we also feel the prospects for a multiyear transportation bill is greater this year than it has been for nearly a decade.","Importantly, our company is well-positioned to capitalize on the many opportunities we see. From a geographical and operational approach, we're poised to deliver high-quality products, which in turn, translates into increased revenues, profits and value for Martin Marietta and our investors. All the while, we remain committed to our core foundational pillars: world-class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability and customer satisfaction, which together should lead to increased shareholder value.","If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. The first question is focused on the fundamentals. How much of the incremental margin performance in the quarter was driven by lower costs, in other words, the $9 million that you outlined earlier, versus pricing or any other factor? And along the pricing line, what we're trying to get a better sense is, are there certain markets that are seeing greater pricing leverage? And essentially, are you seeing the benefit yet from a geographic mix or are you just mainly seeing improvement purely from price increases? Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Kathryn, thank you for your questions. What I would say is several things are really hitting that. Number one, pricing is falling right to the bottom line in many respects. So let's start with that notion. The other piece that I think is important is we are talking about an emerging recovery in the Southeast right now. And we've discussed in the past when places like Georgia saw 70% of their volume decline and North Carolina saw 50% of its volume decline, volume coming back in those markets is very, very powerful. When we're looking at job rate recovery and growth right now and we're seeing North Carolina and Georgia in the top five and top seven, that will drive volumes in those states.","You have to remember, there was a day and an hour that we made $100 million in the Southeastern United States. And when we were making $100 million in the Southeastern United States, we didn't have the type of presence or geographical location that we do today. So Kathryn, to your point, pricing is helping. We're clearly seeing very good cost control in the heritage business. And yes, we are getting a mix help from the Southeast coming back.","To the other part of your question relative to what we're seeing relative to price increases, it's entirely consistent with what we've been discussing for the last several quarters. We said that you should expect the west to outpace the east for a while. That continues to be what we're seeing. Texas, we continue to see very nice double-digit price increases. That said, we're seeing double-digit price increases in Indiana. We're seeing double-digit price increases in Ohio. We're seeing double-digit price increases in portions of the Southeast as well. So we've got a good spread of price increases throughout our entire operation. That's something that, again, with volumes recovering and contractor confidence, we anticipated that we would see.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Thank you. My second question relates to your California asset divestiture. And just a couple of housekeeping questions related to those. What was the EBITDA, trailing 12-month EBITDA contribution from California? I know this historically had been a pretty big laggard, but is it \u2013 what is EBITDA for trailing 12 months? How much G&A is associated with these assets? And apart from some tax treatment of the transaction? Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Kathryn, I'll give it to you this way. If we look at the six months that we owned the California cement operations last year, we had about a $5 million EBITDA on that. Obviously, that tells you the EBITDA contribution that you're looking at in the second half of the year isn't something that I want you to spend a lot of time adjusting your model for. So I think that would be entirely fair. I think with respect to the tax treatment, on the federal side, we'll be able to utilize the NOLs that we have to basically take care of any federal tax there. We anticipate there might be $10 million to $11 million worth of state tax that may be captured out of that $420 million number. So again, what we feel like is, we have a very tax-efficient transaction under the structure that we put forward.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","And G&A, how much should we expect that will go away?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","That again, Kathryn, very little G&A associated with that facility, so that I would tell you from an EBITDA and G&A perspective, it's not going to be enough to move any needle.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi, Ward and Anne. It's actually P. T. Luther standing in for Timna today.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, P. T.","P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hi there. I was wondering if you could just give a better sense of the demand traction that you're seeing the Southeast? Is it continued steady improvement or would you say the cadence or the trajectory has changed of late?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a very good, steady improvement. I mean here's the way that I would think of it. If you look at Florida, from where I'm sitting, it's very positive. We're seeing all segments up. It's number three in job growth, which was really fueling construction. It's got a very strong DOT program, it's near-record levels. The I-4 Ultimate job is very much underway. And again, only 25% of the funds in Florida come from the federal government, so they've got a good, strong program there. They are number one in res right now and number three in non-res, so all of that feels very good for Florida and our import business there.","Georgia, we believe, is really starting to hit its stride. I mean, we're looking at Georgia at number five in job growth, number three in res, number 10 in non-res, effectively a doubling of DOT construction in that state that candidly, won't even really start to impact it until 2016, but we are seeing the benefits of the TSLOS (29:11) program in South Georgia as well, which I think is a good precursor on what we'll see in the Northern parts of the state.","And what I would say on North Carolina, and I think this is disproportionately important, is now we're seeing North Carolina really as an up-and-comer. I mean think of it in these terms: number seven in employment, get this though, number 51 in housing, but number 10 in single family housing. We're starting to see more single family housing and more subdivision work in North Carolina. And number 18 in non-residential. And then if I'm looking at DOT, just over a trailing 12-month period, awards are up 29%. But here's something you can take away as well: we have a Republican governor, House and Senate, and one of the biggest single fights that we have in North Carolina right now is how much more we're going to spend as a state on transportation. So to your point, looking at those Southeastern states and those three tend to be disproportionately important to us, that really is a strong driver for us. Does that answer your question?","P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Yeah. That's helpful, thanks. And then also if I could dig a bit more into demand on the energy-related side. We've got oil at sub-$50. I know you made some positive comments on your initial commentary, but just wondering if you could talk about a little bit more what you're seeing there in terms of demand related to shale, if that's stabilized, if you see any LNG projects at risk, things of that sort.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think it has either stabilized or it's stabilizing. When we spoke at the end of Q1, we said we thought it would look a lot like it looked in 2012, which was about a 7 million ton level as opposed to about \u2013 I mean a 6 million ton level as opposed to 7.5 million last year. I think you've got a couple things. One, it has continued to slow. Weather has clearly affected it. If I had to sit here today and give you a sense of it, I think it will probably be somewhere between 4.5 million tons and 5 million tons of product going directly to the shale plays. So I think that's probably real.","As we come back and answer the second half of your question relative to the large projects going on in South Texas, I guess I would say several things in that regard. Number one, I think the LNG projects are clearly starting up. Freeport is now shipping. The Schneer project will be next. If we're looking at what we think those volumes may look like over a multi-year period, I mean I could see over 1 million tons going to that in the back half of this year. And just looking at what we see right now, I can see at least 0.5 million or more than 0.5 million per year really through 2019. So again, if we're looking at what's going on there for a multi-year period, it looks pretty attractive.","I mean if we're looking at non-building just \u2013 period across the United States, it's up 30%, but it's overwhelmingly still driven by what we're seeing in Texas. So Texas is up $18.5 billion, and that's over half of the national increase. So we see something in that portion of a non-res that continues to be healthy and we think what we're seeing also in office and retail, up 22% for the quarter, doing exactly what we thought. We believe that the portions of non-res that were going to be strong this year would overpower the weakness in shale. And we think that \u2013 those two things coming together, together with simply lower energy pricing, is actually a pretty healthy mix for us right now.","P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that. And the last question, and then I'll hand it over. Diesel prices, I think you've assumed a rather high price relative to where spots have been of late. So I'm wondering if you can give us any more color on the diesel price that's assumed in the guidance for the back half.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","If we're looking \u2013 I can give you a sense of where we are now, and then really what we've said is we thought we would have full-year savings of a little bit over $39 million. So if we look at where we are now, obviously, we had $9 million worth of savings in heritage in Q2, just a little bit over $11 million for the full business. We had about $10 million in Q1, so again, if you want to just carry that out at a fairly normal cadence and come up with about $39.2 million savings for the full year, you wouldn't be a mile off.","P. T. Luther - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thanks again, Ward.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, P. T. Take care.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. Just on the synergy update for the TXI acquisition, you bumped up your target again here today. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what bucket these additional synergies are coming from? And how much more potential upside is there given that you've taken up your synergy targets several times already?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, Garik, if we go back and look at what the synergies looked like at the beginning, it was $70 million. We've had about $34 million would come from SG&A and about $36 million operationally. You're right, we did take it up earlier in the year and when we did that, the SG&A savings that we were seeing at that point had gone up to about $41 million, and we think that's the show on that.","The operational savings had gone up to around $86 million, and again, these are operational issues. It's what we're seeing combining Chico and Bridgeport, what we're seeing pulling together their former Mill Creek and our former Mill Creek. So the operational synergies that we saw when we came back in January were about $86 million. Now going forward we think again the SG&A is staying static at about $42 million. We're seeing operational synergies really filling the balance of that at about $82 million, and then tallying it all up to about around that $120 million number.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. Switching now to cement, you saw good sequential improvements in that pricing. I was wondering if you could provide any additional color about potential price increases later on in this fall. And also as a follow up, would there be any impact to the divestiture on reported pricing, meaning is there any mix implications from exiting California as it relates to the consolidated price?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Garik, here's what I would say. If we're looking at pricing for the year, Q2 pricing, it was up 17% in Texas. It was also up 17% in California. Now, there is a bogey between those two numbers. So if you're looking at Texas pricing for us at $102.85 and California pricing at $89.45, I mean that pretty much gives you the mix on how that's going to look. So, yeah, it certainly would make ASP on cement better without the California numbers in there.","With respect to pricing, I guess I've got a couple of observations. Weather slowed everything down mightily in Texas. And you know that and I do, too. If we're looking at volumes, North Texas volumes for the quarter were down for us 22%. South Texas, they were down 18%. I think in that type of environment, will we be looking for some price increases later in the year? We'll certainly be looking for it. I think as a practical matter, the fact that price increases have done so far what they've done in that type of a weather-challenged volume environment is actually a very good story. We're more focused right now on what we're going to be doing with pricing as we come out early in 2016 as opposed to the latter part of 2015.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Makes sense. The last question is on a point of clarification in the press release. I believe you indicated additional cement maintenance expected in the fourth quarter. You had some here in the second quarter. I was just wondering maybe if you can provide an annual expected maintenance expense. Or I guess in other words, how much are you expecting the fourth quarter to incur?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, just relative to the kilns themselves? I missed the first part of your question. Is that where you're going here?","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, I read in the press release you are anticipating additional maintenance in the fourth quarter in cement. So I was just wondering if you could quantify that.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","If we look at what the 2015 numbers look like, Q1 was $5.4 million, Q2 $5.9 million. We're looking at a Q3 forecast of $6.1 million and we're looking at a Q4 forecast of $14.1 million, which brings you to an all-in kiln forecast of $31.5 million.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Super helpful. Thanks.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And that's for the total cement business, Garik.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","That's got everything rolled in, so that's Texas and California for the purposes, just for clarity.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Garik.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And hopefully this will be the last question on California. The revenues at the sold California cement operation were, annualized?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I didn't understand your question.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","What were the annual revenues of your California cement operation?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Craig, we have (38:30) disclosed what those annual revenues were. We'll obviously come back and talk more about the transaction once we're done. But I thinking giving a sense of really, we've got about, call it, an average 1.5 million tons of capacity there. I think with what we've given on the capacity numbers and the EBITDA numbers, until the transaction is done, I think that's probably as much detail as I'd feel comfortable offering on that.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And you've been performing at about 80% of capacity there?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","In California, it's been under capacity for quite a while and we've certainly discussed that. If we were looking in Texas, it's going to be somewhere in the mid-80%s, in California it would have been considerably under that, yes.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. In the press release, you noted $18 million of added pension expense from a lower discount rate assumption. Is that all in the second quarter? Or how is that...","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Craig, this is Anne. That will be throughout the course of the year and about 60% of that flows through production overhead. The balance flows through SG&A because it follows on a per capita basis.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And so about the run rate, I assume you're going to run that throughout the year, so the run rate I assume is comparable to what we're looking at in the second quarter?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is now open.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you, Ward and Anne. You guys purchased $100 million of stock in the quarter, expect to buy back more with the Oro Grande sale. And I think you mentioned it was $420 million. Are you expecting to use all $420 million on the buyback? Or is that just a general number? And can you give us any color at all on potential timing just roughly?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You know what, our good friends from the state of California, as I said, will take a little bit of that. So we'll have to assume some of that $420 million comes off, but that's only going to be about $10 million or $11 million. The short answer is, we do intend to use all of that to repurchase the stock. And the exact way that we'll do that, we're going to play that carefully as we go through the balance of the year. But we certainly intend to utilize that during the year to buy back the stock, yes.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Okay, through the year. Great. And then along the same lines but from a M&A standpoint, you guys are obviously very committed to buying back stock. But how are you thinking about potential M&A with your current buyback goals and with some potential opportunity possibly coming available from some pending consolidation out there in the market?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Trey. I hear you and I agree with you. We are excited about continuing to grow our business. We're looking at a number of different transactions right now. Most of them tend to be, in my view, very attractive bolt-on transactions that we're looking at in existing markets. The nice thing is, with our balance sheet in the shape that it's in, we can do multiple things. We can continue to return money to shareholders. And the fact that we've returned $154 million to the shareholders in the first half of the year is something what we're proud of. But I can tell you too at the end of the year, I'd be surprised if we don't have some very attractive bolt-on acquisitions.","Remember for us, now Trey, the turn of leverage is $850 million. Before we did this transaction with TXI, the largest deal we had ever done was Redland and that was $270 million. So, our ability to fund for a balance sheet cash flow or otherwise, very attractive, bolt-on transactions is great, and our interest is great as well.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All right, that's real helpful, Ward. Thank you. And then, Anne, this one might before you. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe your guidance, last assumed diesel prices were around $3.39 a gallon. Can you give us an update? What your average diesel price was in the quarter? And then any update on what's baked into that guidance, the updated guidance that you guys gave us on EBITDA for the full year?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The average diesel price was $2.12, as I think Ward had indicated in the opening comments. As we indicated, we will have about $39 million to $40 million of savings that we've got built into the guidance for the year. And we've recognized about $20 million of that through the first six months.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","All right. Thanks a lot. I guess I missed that part of the comments. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Trey, just to add a little bit more color, to give you a sense of \u2013 we've burned about 11.2 million gallons in Q2, and you can imagine, Q3 is usually our heaviest usage quarter, so if that helps.","Trey H. Grooms - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Yes, it does. Thanks a lot. Good luck.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Jerry.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ward, can you talk about, as we enter year end, any other significant market repricing opportunities that you see heading into next year? Obviously, we've got a big structural improvement in a big chunk of the West Group this year. Can you, in rough terms, talk about any opportunities that are high on your radar screen heading into January 1 announced price increases?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You know what? Absolutely. Number one, we'll come out with January 1 price increases in all of our geographies. What I'll tell you too is either between mid-year price increases, we're simply upping what we're doing on bidded work, we're seeing price increases in all of our districts and divisions night now.","Now, it may be captured or put out in different nomenclature and some places you will actually see mid-year price increases. For example, we have seen that very specifically in portions of the Southeast. We've seen that very, very specifically in portions of the Southwest, but other places we're seeing it on a job-by-job, bid-by-bid basis, again preparing not just for the second half of the year, but preparing as we go into next year.","Again, I have seen at least some of the Dodge data that's come out over the last few days. And as I look at that, this gives me a sense again that we'll be looking at a pretty high degree of contractor confidence going into next year. Again, this is not our guidance. I'm just giving you what Dodge is saying. But Dodge is seeing total construction up in 2016, 12%. It's seeing non-res up 11%. It's seeing residential up 20%.","And you've often heard what I've said in the past and that is, at a certain point, as volume continues to grow more than that 5% basis, you should be able to see your percentage pricing and your percentage volume growth linked up and moving in some degree at tandem together with the pricing having a little bit of a lag. So I've tried to answer your question relatively to what we're seeing on a division-by-division basis, how we're going about it and also at least what people who do forecasting for living, like FW Dodge, are saying about next year and how that's going to relate to price, and I hope that helped.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. I appreciate the color. And as you think about the price increases mid-year, I know you went after a more significant beginning of the year price increase this year. Can you just give us an update on what kind of mid-year price increase cadence we should be thinking about?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You know it's going to vary pretty considerably. There are some products \u2013 you know sand is short, for example, in the DFW marketplace right now. There are a number of sand operations along the Red River that were so flooded out that operators are truly not going be in a position, in some instances as I understand it, to open them until the fall this year. So sand prices in DFW may be up $2 a ton.","Again, we're looking to take ready-mix up $8 a yard in DFW on or around September 1. So I mean those are pretty heavy movements. At the same time, there are parts of Southeast where we're going in and seeing some customers going up as much $1 a ton. And part of what I think is moving to me as I'm seeing the way mid-year forward thinking about next year will look like, we're getting out as much of that nomenclature around cents and we're talking more about dollars. And I think that's an important transition in the conversation.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And lastly, on the last count, I think there were a dozen or so states that have fairly recently increased highway spending in absence of better federal spending. Can you talk about, are there any states based on your local folks where you think the increase in state funding is close to moving forward? I know you have a good handle of the political landscape there.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, but I mean here's what we've seen and here's what we'll see. Iowa put their gas tax up $0.10 March 1. That's going put another $215 million annually in what they're doing. That's about a 30% increase. Again, Georgia's coming back, adding almost $1 billion to their DOT budget. That's almost a doubling of it. To give you a sense of it, our quick math says $900 million of new spending consumes probably around 7 million tons of crushed stone. We've talked about how powerful incremental stone is with a market like that.","Florida's got just shy of a record DOT budget. Again, we talked about the fact that North Carolina right now, with a Republican legislature and governor, is going through the process, but our senate who would like to stop seeing funds diverted from a highway trust fund to the general fund, put several hundred million dollars a year more to North Carolina highways. We're certainly a fan of that.","Our governor would like to come back and borrow money at historically low rates with a couple different bond issues that are there on the ballot for later this fall. We'll see how all of that goes but, again, Iowa's a Republican state, Nebraska's a Republican state, North Carolina's a Republican state and these are all states, as is Texas, with their Prop 7, looking to put more money into highways right now separate and distinct from what may happen on the federal side.","One thing that I think we need to remember too, Jerry, is that if we get a highway bill, part of what's going to happen is we're going to see parts of the United States and, in my view, more rural areas, have more highway money to spend. And I think that's going to be important, one, for economic development. And number, two some of the rural operations we have can be very profitable operations. And those are the operations throughout this downturn that have suffered disproportionately. So I think the fact that DOT initiatives are really taking over at the state level, and they're doing a lot of it for themselves, and we've got this great prospect, I believe, of getting a highway bill this year, that's the one-two punch that could be notable.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey. So I apologize if I missed this earlier, but can you, I know overall heritage volumes are up just about 1%. Can you say what Texas did in isolation?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Texas, we talked about what Texas was when we took out North Troy.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we really look at the West Group, Ted. We've not really given any specific guidance on individuals, other than about 1.8 million tons of shipments were deferred out of the total 3 million tons in the state of Texas alone. But if you look at reported volumes in the West Group, take out the divested assets that we divested of last year, but are still included in the numbers and look at the impact of the rain, or the weather-deferred shipments in the West Group, adjusting for all those items, our volumes would have been up about 11%, those two, those together add up to about 3.1 million tons.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. That's super helpful. And so, I think everybody on the call appreciates all the things going in Texas's favor, whether it's res or non-res and the public side. I guess what I'm just curious is, how do you see kind of momentum building in the back half and then when we hit 2016 in the state of Texas specifically? And then what would be the implications on pricing? What kind of framework would you encourage people to embrace?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Say it again, I guess what I would say, is we start with our largest end use there, which is going to be infrastructure and we began with $7.5 billion worth of lettings. And that's on the heels of two previous record budgets. It goes back to my commentary when I said I can see volumes being very aggressive in Texas, not just for this year and next, but really for years out.","And then when we're coming back and looking at the sheer level of non-res activity that continues to be there and the emerging presence now that we're seeing in office and retail in that state and the continued mature housing market that's there. And what I mean by that is we're seeing new subdivisions built. So Ted, that's simply going to be a more aggregate-intensive undertaking relative to residential than multi-family or otherwise.","So, what I would say is, our outlook for volumes in Texas continues to be quite good and we've been consistent that you should expect pricing in the West to generate outpaced pricing in the East at least on a percentage basis. And I don't see anything right now that sways me from that view.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And on the $7.5 billion of lettings, can you put that in context? What was lettings in calendar 2014, so are there fiscal 2014 just so we can dimensionalize what that change is?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, if you go back and look at it, remember, they're on a fiscal year that ends in August. And what Texas has done over the last several years is they come out with a much bigger budget than they're typically able to spend. So they came out this year looking at something that started in the $9 billion to $10 billion range, came back and said they're going to be at about $7.5 billion. That's reasonably consistent with where they were last year as well. So now, if you're taking those two, building on that, what we believe is going to be past Prop 7, that's going to come back and put another $2.5 billion, we think we're going to see a nice run rate probably in that zone, maybe as low as the $5 billions, maybe as high as the $8 billion or $9 billion over a period of time.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. That's helpful. The second thing I just wanted to ask you was on the guidance side. So if you take EBITDA guidance down $25 million, it sounds like cement's about $10 million, you could back into aggregates being about $25 million. Could you walk through all of the components, the headwinds and the tailwinds just so we understand exactly? It sounded like the embedded diesel benefits were upsides versus what was embedded in the prior guidance, but maybe I misunderstood that. I just wanted to make sure we understand.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, I think the big issue, Ted, is that you've got I think it was around 13 million tons (sic) [$13 million] (54:45) of profit that was deferred from Q1...","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","$13 million.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and then you've got about $40 million in Q2. And the fact as you take that, let's call it, $53 million and come back to the view (54:55), it's going to be impossible to make all of that up. And I think one of the issues that we've been faced with, but I think the industry has been faced with in Texas, if it rains for a while, it impacts your sales. If it rains for a long while, it impacts your sales and it impacts your production.","And I think several things are happening. One, I think the logistics and supply chain is going to be really stretched in Texas for the rest of the year. And by that I mean, can people find enough trucking to get aggregates to locations? I think the short answer is going to be they can't.","I think the other issue we talked a little bit about sand plants that continue to be flooded right now. The ability to come and really push product out of those sites the way that we would wish is going to be challenged as well.","And I think the last piece of it is, can people even keep up with some of the clean stone requirements going forward? Now, some of the good news for us is a lot of the work that we see both in North Texas and South Texas can be relatively new work. So think about it in these terms, I-35 in North Texas and the Grand Parkway in South Texas, we're going to see more base going on those jobs for a while so that the clean stone needs won't be as acute, but they're still going to be pretty serious, particularly as we roll into next year. It's simply the inability of the industry to meet what I think the demand could be.","The other issue is this, Ted, what's weather going to look like in Q4? If we have a good long fall, frankly like we did last year, then we can probably cover a lot of that ground, but we're counting on a more normal Q4 this year. So that's really what takes down the EBITDA guidance.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. So I just want to be sure I understand this. There's $53 million of profit pushed from one half into two half and beyond. Do you think you capture half of that, which is the net $25 million and then another $10 million on cement?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","That's not...","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","That's probably close enough (56:55).","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. That's a nice synopsis, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Are there any other offsets we should be thinking about? Did diesel benefit embedded to the upside (57:01)?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I think the diesel benefit is pretty much there in what we said on the, let's call it, $40 million full-year benefit. I don't see that moving dramatically, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And there's no acceleration in realized synergies? And then I'll get back in queue.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Look, I'm just going to take the $120 million and be really happy with that. So I think we are where we are.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. So either that's a non-answer or it's not getting realized sooner in 2015.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Look, I think there will be some synergies that will be realized in 2015. I'm just not prepared to quantify it precisely what that will be in 2015.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarification.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ted.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi. Good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Adam.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","You guys lowered your outlook for sales to the infrastructure market. I'm just curious if that's a reflection of the weather in the first half, or what your expectations are for the back half?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You know what, I think it's more a reflection of the weather in the first half. And it's a reflection of the drying out that's occurred in some markets. I was just talking with Ted on the last question, you do need a period of time not just for it not to rain after you've had this degree of dampness. But you frankly need some time for it just to dry out. And we're seeing some of that on barge stirrup (58:26) work that's going on, particularly in the Southwest right now. So, again, it's not a concern of what's going on from an underlying perspective, but it's simply looking at where we are after half one and some of the issues that I think we'll be faced with as an industry in the Southwest in half two.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then for Texas, and last year you had an October price increase. Is that something you might do again this year?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Part of what I think we need to be sensitive to, you had so many kilns when it was wet, simply just shut down. And part of what I was gratified by during the shutdown, you didn't see a lot of erosion in pricing in that marketplace. And I think part of what we need to be focused on is really taking care of our customers here in the second half and being more focused on what we're going to do relative to the price in that Texas cement market going into 2016 as opposed to the back half now of this year.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Fair enough. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked. But could you comment on the slight pricing decline sequentially in aggregates? I mean, obviously weather played a role there, but was it more due to mix shift or a move of where aggregate was actually sold?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it probably would have been a little bit of both, but the simple fact is, if we're going location by location, product by product, everything is going up, which is why I would tell you it's going to be a little bit of both on geographic mix and product mix as well.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Judy Lynn Merrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. This is Judy Merrick for Keith Hughes. I was just wondering if there's anything else you could add about the underlying growth in the non-residential market. You addressed the energy impact and kind of took that out. But particularly in light non-residential, was there some weather impact also? You mentioned that Texas has a big component. Or was a lot of the growth seen in the Florida\/Georgia\/other states?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","There were some components to weather in other states. I mean, if we go back and take a look at places like Colorado and Iowa and Indiana and others, they had some of the wettest quarters in history, so clearly weather was an issue there. But back to your point on really what's happening in non-res, for example, we're seeing the first speculative commercial building in Atlanta since before the crash. I mean we haven't seen that in a while. So clearly, we feel like Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Texas and Colorado is actually doing quite well in non-res. Again, if we go back to what we're seeing too in non-building, the non-building activity is pretty strong. Now, granted, this is going to tend to be the heavier as opposed to the office and retail type of work, but we're seeing good power plant, bridges, other non-building-type activity, but we are clearly seeing the speculative office. And again, that portion of our business before was up 22%. And we feel like the space in which we have a presence are really helping drive that.","Judy Lynn Merrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay, great. And on the decline in the heavy non-residential, was that mix of both energy and the weather?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it was. Principally I would say clearly you're seeing a slowdown in shale as we anticipated, so that's some of it. And the other half was the weather. So I think that's clearly your one-two punch there.","Judy Lynn Merrick - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","All right, great. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Judy.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ward Nye, President and CEO. You may begin.","C. Howard Nye","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials' quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As we announced in our earnings release this morning, first quarter 2014 results reflect both sales growth and improved profitability. Aggregates product line shipments increased 8% for the quarter, with notable growth in Texas and Colorado. Importantly, despite the impact of unusually adverse winter weather, shipments for each month increased over the respective prior-year month, led by 13% growth in March. Higher net sales, coupled with diligent cost management, resulted in a 400 basis point improvement in the Aggregates business gross margin.","In addition to our quarterly results, we're excited about our proposed business combination with Texas Industries. This transaction will enhance our position in Texas and provide an opportunity to serve the expanding California cement market. Most importantly, we believe the combination will create long-term value for shareholders of both Martin Marietta and TXI.","As part of the combination process, we're continuing discussions with Department of Justice toward resolving our Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act filing or HSR. Although we're not yet in a position to publicly respond to any specific possible resolution, we believe any HSR issues will not be material. Accordingly, our views today regarding this aspect remained unchanged from January. We expect the combination will proceed on the original timetable, likely to close this summer.","Before elaborating further on our first quarter results, let me remind you that today's discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","Now for more in the quarter. Private construction continued to be strong across all of our geographies, with each private end-use market achieving double-digit aggregates product line volume growth. The nonresidential end-use market represented 34% of our quarterly shipments and increased 13% over the prior year quarter. Growth was notable in the energy sector and, specifically, at the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, where shipments, consisting primarily of base stone products increased over the prior year quarter.","Private residential construction put in place during the first 2 months of the year increased more than 15% over the comparable prior-year period, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consistent with this trend, volumes to the residential market, which accounted for 15% of our quarterly shipments, increased 16% over the prior year quarter. As residential strength in many of our Western markets continues to both endure and grow, we are particularly pleased to see emerging residential strength in important Southeast areas, among them Atlanta and Charlotte. For example, in 2013, the 22-county Atlanta region experienced nearly 14,000 housing starts, up 67% year-over-year. And new-home closings were up 39%. In fact, the Metro Study Report is forecasting Atlanta housing starts to increase by another 25% in 2014.","In Charlotte, home builders are projecting new starts to be up nearly 12%. This trend is supported by a recent Urban Land Institute and PricewaterhouseCoopers report projecting the Charlotte Metro area to be the 16th fastest-growing housing market in the United States in 2014","Wrapping up the private sector. Shipments to the ChemRock and Rail end-use market represented 12% of quarterly volumes and increased 14% due to higher ballast and agricultural lime shipments. The remaining 39% of our aggregates product line business went to the infrastructure end-use market. Despite the impact of winter weather, public sector shipments were positively affected by state funding initiatives and were flat compared with the prior year quarter. We noted growth in the West Group, particularly in Texas and Colorado, where robust state funding programs, along with public-private partnership initiatives and the promise of long awaited TIFIA awards provide additional funding sources for transportation investment. As previously noted, we expect state initiatives to play a more critical role in future public-sector activity. That said, the infrastructure market continues to be unsettled by the lack of certainty surrounding long-term federal highway funding. To that end, we continue to monitor congressional deliberations regarding the federal transportation funding beyond the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21, which is scheduled to expire on September 30.","Additionally, a revenue infusion is needed to maintain an uninterrupted flow of reimbursements from the Highway Trust Fund now expected to encounter a funding deficit before the end of the fiscal year. Over the previous 5 years, Congress has used general fund transfers to bridge the shortfall. Amid this circumstance, several states, including Colorado, Georgia and Iowa, have stated their intentions to take a cautious approach on committing to major projects until federal funding is stabilized. As a practical matter, since most state fiscal years start on July 1, it is possible fundings [ph] will be weighted toward later in the various state fiscal years.","On a positive note in that regard, both the House Transportation and Senate Environmental and Public Works committees have announced their support for a new highway bill at existing funding levels, plus adjustments [ph] for inflation. Further, both President Obama and House Ways and Means Chairman, Dave Camp, included highway trust fund remedies in their respective tax reform initiatives.","Due to a combination of geography and product mix, our aggregates product line experienced a 1.3% average selling price decline versus the prior year quarter. Notably, base stone and sand and gravel shipments, particularly in the West Group, represented an expanded share of our quarterly sales. We view this as evidence of early-stage construction activity and an attractive precursor to more follow-on clean stone demand still to come in a host of our markets. If our aggregates product line had the same geographic and product mix as the first quarter of 2013, the average selling price would have increased approximately 1%.","Aggregates production decreased 2.4% as sufficient workdays were either hampered or lost due to extreme weather conditions, including snow, ice and freezing temperatures. For example, our Greensboro district was shut down 10 days during the quarter due to such weather constraints. As expected, the decline in production led to an increase in production cost per ton. We estimate that as a result of unusually adverse winter conditions, aggregate direct production costs were impacted by $5 million.","Our vertically integrated product lines each reported growth in sales and gross profit. Ready-mix concrete product line achieved a 45% increase in net sales, reflecting volume and pricing growth. The asphalt line reported increased shipments, which led to a 9% increase in net sales. The road pavement business nearly doubled its net sales, primarily due to increased activity in Colorado.","The Specialty Products business continued to make a significant contribution to our consolidated results. For the quarter, net sales for this business were $57.4 million, an increase of $2 million, which was driven by both growth -- driven by growth in the chemicals and chemicals product line. The business reported a gross margin of nearly 33%, which was negatively affected by increased usage of natural gas and the impact of a colder-than-expected winter on natural gas pricing.","Consistent with our outlook for the year, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.4 million or 190 basis points as a percentage of net sales compared with the prior year quarter. The reduction is due to the absence of costs related to the information systems upgrade completed late last year. Additionally, pension expense declined from the prior year.","Our adjusted consolidated loss from operations was $6.4 million compared with a loss from operations of $23.3 million in the prior year quarter, an improvement of over 70%. That said, we, of course, incurred business development expenses related to the pending combination with TXI. For the quarter, these costs totaled $9.5 million. Inclusive of these costs, our consolidated loss from operations was $15.9 million. Our loss per diluted share was $0.47. Excluding business development expenses, our adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.35 compared with the loss per diluted share of $0.61 for the prior year quarter.","For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $7 million, which reflects the impact of higher net sales on working capital. We prudently invested $37 million in capital projects and maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At March 31, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 2.74x in compliance with the limits under our debt covenant.","Looking ahead to the full year 2014, we continue to see positive trends in our business end markets, especially private-sector employment and general construction activity. Nonresidential construction is expected to reflect growth in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors. Shale development and related follow-on public and private construction activities are anticipated to remain strong. Furthermore, the commercial buildings sector should benefit from improved market fundamentals, including higher occupancies and rents, strengthened property values and increased real estate lending. Based on these factors, we anticipate nonresidential end use shipments to increase in the mid- to high-single digits. Residential construction should continue to grow in our primary markets, driven by near historically low mortgage rates and rising employment. For the first time since 2007, total annual housing starts are expected to exceed 1 million units. We believe these trends will lead to double-digit volume growth in residential end-use shipments.","For the public sector, authorized highway funding from MAP-21 will increase slightly compared with 2013. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects are expected to grow and continue to play a more enhanced role in public-sector activity. Based on these trends and expectations, we anticipate aggregate shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to increase slightly.","Finally, our ChemRock and Rail end-use market is expected to have low-single-digit growth compared with 2013. Cumulatively, we look for aggregates product line shipments to increase 4% to 5% compared with 2013. The most significant risk to our aggregates volume guidance will be congressional actions and timing surrounding the expiration of MAP-21 in September, along with uncertainty over funding for the highway trust fund.","We also expect aggregates product line pricing to increase 3% to 5% over 2013, although this increase will not be uniform across the company. Aggregates product line direct production costs per ton are expected to decrease slightly compared with 2013.","Our vertically integrated businesses should generate between $385 million and $405 million of net sales and $40 million to $45 million of gross product.","Net sales for the Specialty Products segment should range from $225 million to $235 million, generating $85 million to $90 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices remain 2 key drivers for this business.","SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline compared with 2013 driven in part by nearly $8 million of nonrecurring costs incurred in 2013, primarily related to the information systems upgrade, as well as lower pension costs in 2014.","Interest expense should remain consistent with 2013. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 29%, excluding discrete events.","Capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million.","To conclude, we are encouraged by numerous macroeconomic indicators of increased construction activity for 2014. We believe the private sector will continue its strong growth, which, coupled with increased state level funding of key projects, should stimulate public-sector activity. We also remain enthusiastic about the pending combination with TXI. We believe our expanded platform for growth and increased levels of construction activity are a powerful combination that will enhance long-term shareholder value.","Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","I think the first thing, Ward, is congratulations on your new role within the company, well deserved. Could you expand a little bit, you talked about geographic issues impacting pricing and mix. Could you expand a little bit on both of those, since pricing early in the year does tend to have a fairly important impact for the overall company for the year?","C. Howard Nye","Sure, Arnie. And Arnie, thanks for your comments, too. I really do appreciate that. Here's the way I think about volume -- or pricing in Q1. Look, we had strong volume increases in Rocky Mountain and we saw strong volume increases in the Southwest. So really, those are 2 of our lowest priced areas. So if we think about that in varying degrees of context, in the Southwest, we saw base sales go up by almost 1 million tons, but we saw clean stone stay relatively static from a volume perspective. Now what I'll tell you is the base stone pricing went up as did the clean stone pricing, but still that's 1 million more tons of base, which is obviously a lower priced product in a lower-priced market. Similarly, if we look in the Rocky Mountain division up and down the front range in Denver, again, if we're looking at base and fill material in that market, they are up about 2x over where they were last year in the first quarter. So again, you're looking at a lower-priced market and lower-priced products going. I actually think that's a good sign, Arnie, because what it's telling us for the first time in a long time, we are seeing new construction. And part of what I tried to spell out in the prepared remarks is that's simply going to be a driving force for more mature construction that's coming behind it. And in fact, we're seeing some of that in the pricing that we're seeing in concrete stone and asphalt stone. If we look at pricing for the quarter for concrete stone, that was up 2.9% for the quarter and pricing for asphalt stone was up 3.7%. So as we come back and revisit where we are relative to pricing, to us it is truly a geographic and a products mix issue. Our confidence around the pricing story continues to be very high and I think what we're seeing in Texas on a continuing basis and what we're seeing in Colorado are very, very good signs.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","Were there any markets you didn't actually have some price increase in the materials that you were selling?","C. Howard Nye","When we're going to same product, same quarry, this is not a marketplace in which we are seeing pricing retreat. Again, as we are looking at pricing, we're watching it go nicely up. There are a number of markets that we didn't put price increases in until April 1. As you recall, that's really when much of the construction season's starting in earnest anyway. But I think that answers your question. Did I hit what you needed, Arnie?","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","Absolutely. Very thorough. My other broad question which I'm sure is on the mind of virtually everyone on the call is you have the potential for a transformational acquisition with Texas Industries and yet we're having some issues with the DOJ. Is there a way you can perhaps expand on some of the issues you're dealing with and how this might get resolved?","C. Howard Nye","Sure. Happy to do that. Actually, we are precisely where we thought we would be with DOJ right now. I mean, you're right, there's a second request. The second request is really quite narrow. We feel like the issues that are involved in the second request and we're working with DOJ staff right now are very much in line with what we had anticipated. We think this is a circumstance that's likely to be resolved in a matter of weeks. Because as you'll see, we are not changing our ideas around when the closing will occur. The other thing I will tell you, if this gives you some comfort around it, if we look at the scope of the second request, what that tells us is the view that we've long held that there should not be any quarries put up for sale in Texas is very much consistent with what we thought it would be. So from a timing perspective, Arnie, I think we're exactly where we thought we would be. Looking at the markets and anticipating what the likely result is, I think, again, we're exactly where we thought we would be. And the conversations and dialogue with DOJ staff continues to move along in what we feel like is a very constructive, very progressive way.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just to kind of expand on the last set of questions. Can you talk about the range of the price increases that have gone in this -- so far this year and the timing?","C. Howard Nye","Todd, they will vary. Some will have gone in on January 1, some probably would have gone in on around April 1. If I'm looking at the data that we have right now, in some markets, I'm seeing price up as much on a percentage basis as 14% in some areas. Obviously, there are going to be other areas that will not have that degree of price increase. I don't really want to go market by market for, obviously, competitive reasons and give you a sense of that. But again, if we're looking same on same, price increases are very much where we thought they would be, Todd.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's good. With regard to your aggregates margins, nice looking performance in the quarter, which is interesting given that price was down or the average price was down and you mentioned in the release that production was also down. So can you talk about how you were able to pull that off at the margins?","C. Howard Nye","Number one, I would say we had awfully good cost control and I think that's real kudos to our team. Here's the way that I'd like to think of it for the quarter, Todd, and I think this is a story that we haven't been able to say for a long time. If you come back and take a look at the quarter and you put $9.5 million of extraordinary costs to the TXI transaction, and if you want to come back and basically say that our gross profit was hit by another $5 million, simply due to what we dealt with extraordinary weather. And the biggest component of that was felt principally in our Midwest Division right now or Mid-America. At the end of the day, that's another $5 million. You come back and take that $9.5 million on the extraordinaries with TXI and the $5 million that we feel like we were hit because of the extraordinary weather, basically we're looking at a breakeven Q1, and I think that's pretty impressive because when you go back and take a look at it, that's 24.6 million tons of sales. Back in Q1 of '12, we had 24.9 million tons of sales and on a normalized basis then probably around $0.47 per diluted share loss normalized. And if we're looking at something that feels awfully like breakeven, when you pull out these extraordinaries, I think what that tells us is the cost structure continues to be in the right place. The team is focused on the right things and what we believe we can do relative to pricing continues to be very consistent.","Anne H. Lloyd","Todd, I think, you could almost summarize it by saying when the sun was shining, we were shipping, and that's just not very common in the first quarter.","C. Howard Nye","And the odd thing, Todd, was that was true across the enterprise. I think what a lot of people would have assumed is in a market like Denver, that can be really profoundly affected by winter weather, to Ann's point, when the sun was shining in Denver, life was working pretty well there. So when we suddenly pause and come back and take a look at what was happening with respect to ready-mix in that market, ready-mix in Denver all by itself was up 35%. And asphalt remarkably up even more than that on a percentage basis in a remarkably weather impacted world. So it tells us the momentum we saw in '13 does continue into '14 right now.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And this is probably obvious, but that's a function of underlying demand and backlog, do you think at your customers?","C. Howard Nye","That's what we believe. Again, we think the momentum that we saw in Q4 last year, again, that we thought was very attractive, we think continues into Q1 and throughout the year.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And just sticking with Colorado for a second, do you have a sense for how much of the business there is rebuilding for the floods and FEMA money versus how much is highway money and how sustainable each of those things is?","C. Howard Nye","I think one of the big things that's odd about Denver right now, a lot of the flood and other Colorado DOT money has actually been a little bit slow coming out. I think we saw some of that come out quickly in Q4, simply because they had to. But I think they're looking at so much potential work there, it's coming out slowly. What that tells me is this: The private sector and, again, that's back to the commentary that we had, continues to not only be good, but continues to get better in that market. And from where we sit that's an attractive place to be because private sector work is actually more profitable work for us. So again, if we recognize there's going to be more public work coming behind that, it just continues to make us feel better about that market.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Final question for me. Specialty Products business. So given that you had an impact on the margin from nat gas in the quarter, but given you didn't change your guidance for the year, can I assume that you're anticipating that, that impact wanes or has already begun to wane? And can you talk about the sensitivity of the gas prices there?","C. Howard Nye","Well, it has begun to wane. I mean, steel continues to run at about 76% of capacity right now. Nat gas is back in that $5 range, which is really where we had kind of planned. Keep in mind, what we saw during Q1 was nat gas up year-over-year with the spike of 58% and usage up about 6.5%, because we had some lime constraints really because of that extraordinary weather, which made us operate our kilns in a fashion that's not optimal for running our business. So we think where we're sitting right now for the balance of the year and frankly with what we see as backlogs in the business, we have a lot of conviction around where that business will wrap up.","Anne H. Lloyd","And Todd, that increased usage and cost, our price was about $1.8 million impact on the cost structure of mag -- the Specialty Products business, excuse me, which really essentially, if you would normalize for that, the margins would have been essentially flat with last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","First question is just on pricing in the West Group. You called out mix as a pretty sizable headwind. Just wondering if you have a line of sight as to how long mix could be a headwind this year, are we looking at another quarter, another 2 quarters or there's going to be potentially a longer run headwind until the initial base stone shipments wear off?","C. Howard Nye","Garik, I think it could go for a while. And frankly, I hope that it does in many respects because if we look at the way -- let's talk about Houston for a second. Houston typically is a market that's running at around 85% clean stone. I mean, Houston is considerably below that right now on both sand and gravel and base material. But again, part of what's going on in Houston is they need base stone because they need to come back for new construction and there's been such little demolition in that market. Remember, that's one of the few markets in the United States where oftentimes recycled or crushed concrete can be used as the base product. So again, what we're seeing are some shortages on product like that. We're continuing to see new construction. And the fact is the more new construction that we see, while it may give an optical headwind on pricing, at the end of the day, Garik, that's all it is. Because even as I'm looking at these base price sales in the Southwest and in Denver, the prices are up year-over-year. And the clean stone prices will be up year-over-year. And specifically, coming back to Texas, as you recall, that was the market where last year we did see a number of midyear price increases. And I think you should expect us to come back and look for that again this year as well.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That makes sense, and I guess it's a good problem to have at this point in the cycle. But I guess just my follow-up there in the context of your pricing guidance being unchanged, just wondering if you could expand a little bit on how you're thinking about it. I can appreciate that there's -- that market volatility is not going to be uniform over the course of the year. But you can help us maybe bridge the gap between the reported price in the first quarter and what needs to happen for you to hit your guidance for this year.","C. Howard Nye","Right now I think in large part, we just need to see volume return to Mid-America and Southeast. Keep in mind, if we're looking at the first quarter, volume in the West was basically up a considerable percentage point. And at the same time, we're watching volumes down in Mid-America and Southeast, particularly as Mid-America comes back, that geographic shift all by itself, Garik, I think comes back and probably fills that hole that you're wondering about.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, makes sense. I guess my last question is on the volume guidance as well. Really good volumes in the quarter. But your full year guidance implies some deceleration in growth. Just wondering what you're thinking about respective volumes over the balance of the year, is it just a measure of caution with respect to the highway bill uncertainty or is there something else going on there?","C. Howard Nye","Okay, Garik, you nailed it. And that's exactly where we were a couple of years ago. And you remember that as well when we were in a reauthorization year. And suddenly it seemed like some win [ph] came out of it. Frankly, it's hard to sit here right now and see that win's [ph] going to come out of it, like it did then. At the same time, it's not our first rodeo with this. So I think to your point, coming back and just remembering what history has been and approaching it in a reason [ph] manner is what we're looking to do. As a practical matter, I think we will likely have some degree of resolution on what the rest of this year looks like on the highway bill relative to funding, probably before Congress leaves for the August recess. And if that's what we have, then when we come back at half year and report our half-year results, then we can come back and revisit where we are on volume guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","The first is on volume progression and the feedback that you had with March being up low teens was very much in line with what we had heard in the market. But in terms of -- if you could maybe dig a little bit more into regional and end market differences and it's -- you're steadily moving your mix shift away from the structure being a bigger percentage of your sales and res and non-res growing to be a bigger percentage. Obviously, we've seen growth there. But if you could maybe compare and contrast, as I said, on the end market and regional differences today and what you're seeing as we go into Q2 and how is that different than what you saw a year or 2 years ago?","C. Howard Nye","Kathryn, that's a good question, a fair one. Let's think about it this way. Let's start in Colorado and work our through the business. Here's a good way to think about what we're seeing in Colorado. I mean, we're continuing to see good residential activity there. We're seeing good commercial activity there. To give you a sense of it, last year at this time, we had 4 paving crews in place in Colorado. This year, we have 16 paving crews in place in Colorado. So again, what I would tell you, is we're watching every component of that economy hit pretty well. As we come a little bit farther south and take a look at the Midwest, again, that's never going to be a big driver on the res side, although res around Des Moines in Omaha is actually, for those markets, look pretty good. Again, what we're seeing is particularly good commercial activity there. We continue to see add-ons at data warehouses for Google, Microsoft and others in that marketplace. And again, what I would tell you on infrastructure there, it continues to be very, very steady. If we come a little bit farther south and take a look at what's going on in DFW and parts of Texas, I mean, DFW, we're looking at Interstate Highway 35 West with considerable tonnage. We're looking at State Highway 183, considerable tonnage. We're looking at homes up 60% year-over-year in DFW, now probably to a 25,000 per annum start right there. If we go down to Houston, we talked about the fact that that's usually a market that you see 85% of the market in clean stone. Base is now considerably up. We're seeing good toll road work there. We're seeing -- basically Harris County Tollway Authority now putting in a $900 million job in Q3. Res is up 8% in that market. When we come back and look at San Antonio, res is up 14% in that market and home inventories are down to 4 months only. So again, we're seeing great activity there. And then suddenly you hit South Texas and you got $5 billion worth of petrochemical or related work. And now for the first time, we are seeing people come back and really look hard at the Energy Sector road repair work that needs to be done there. So that's a good walk-through what we're seeing West and how some of that's moved. When we come East, what we have at last are markets that are important that are getting considerably better. I think part of what you heard us speak to with some degree of specificity is what we're seeing in particular in markets like Charlotte. We were seeing much better employment numbers driving housing and commercial. The I-77 hot lanes, light rail there and apartments are far better than they would've been a year ago. We also continue to see very robust work at Charlotte Douglas Airport. But Kathryn, this is important to North Carolina because the area that had been the sickest for us in many respects has been around the triad, Greensboro, High Point, Winston-Salem, we're seeing good infrastructure work there, in particular the Western loop, which is $100 million job is in that market. We're seeing the Eastern loop coming behind that, 68 connector and seeing a strong subdivision work there. So again an important market for us that's starting to get its legs more slowly than others. But still getting its legs. And then when we come back and take a look at what's going on in Atlanta and we called that out specifically relative to housing and commercial, that's a market that's feeling considerably better than it did a year ago. Not so much, in fairness, on infrastructure, although some of it's better. Of course, the northwest Carter [ph] job went there and that job all by itself is almost as big as the rest of Georgia DOT budget would be. But again, that's a market that saw the private sector just go off the edge. And the private sector in Atlanta has come back very, very nicely. But then as we wrap up and head really more toward Mid-America and Indianapolis in Ohio, Indi for us has been a very good, steady market. And what we like about it is non-res is getting much healthier there. We're looking at Indianapolis as the fifth hottest warehousing area and district in the United States. So when you're adding that commercial component on top of what's been a very steady infrastructure, that's a bit of a change. We're also seeing housing get considerably better in Northern Indianapolis up toward Carmel. And then when we come back and take a look at Ohio, res has gotten much better. There's your delta there. Permits are up 19% in Cincinnati and vacant lots are down 17%. But we also have good infrastructure work on I-70 and I-275. And part of what I really come back at the end of the day and say works well is ready-mix pricing up in that market as much as 6%. So when we're seeing that type of activity, I think when you're seeing ready-mix pricing move in an upward trajectory, that's usually a very good sign for every sector of the market. I apologize for the length of response in that, Katie [ph], but I thought going market by market probably made some sense.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Yes, no, that helps. And I guess this is really a 2-part question, one more directly with pricing, the other somewhat relates to pricing. If you're able, could you parse out on a rough percentage basis how much of pricing the quarter was impacted by geography versus product mix? And then, finally, if you were to look at your markets today versus 5 years ago, how consolidated are your top markets today versus 5 years ago?","C. Howard Nye","I'll let you do the math on the latter part of the question. What I'll say with respect to the geographic and the product mix, I mean, both of those issues, again, were an optical issue going in the quarter and I tried to give some very specific numbers around what we saw, particularly in Texas and Colorado. Okay, if it was same on same, Kathryn, it would have been up 1% or more. I think that's still the best way to think of it.","Anne H. Lloyd","Yes. Kathryn, this is Anne, about, I think it was about 2% with geography, about 1.3%, 1.5% was product, from that average to be just right around 1%, the impact of it.","C. Howard Nye","In fact, 1.8% was geographic and 1.3% was product.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","That's helpful. And the second part of the question, which was I don't if you caught. I had -- my phone cut out, but if you were to look at your overall markets, Martin Marietta today, what percentage are fully consolidated? When I say fully consolidated, you have 3 or 4 players that account for 80-plus percent market share. What is your consolidation today versus the prior peak?","C. Howard Nye","You know what, Kathryn, I think clearly, the industry has seen considerable consolidation since the prior peak. And I think that's a safe observation. I think the other thing that I would ask you to look at and I think it's better for you to look at than for me to opine on is what equals a relevant geographic market, because whether you're moving product by truck, by rail, by boat, by barge or otherwise can impact that pretty considerably as can the barriers to entry, and they're going to vary considerably across markets as well. So I'm going to artfully dodge your question on that at the end of day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Back to pricing for a second, going back a couple of years, 2 or 3 years, there were issues with inventory imbalances in some markets. I'm just wondering where we stand today and whether any issues over inventory imbalances are having a material effect on your pricing outlook for the full year?","C. Howard Nye","The short answer on that is no. They're not having a material impact on pricing for the full year. As you recall, we basically had about 60 million tons that were out there. We pulled that down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Where we were out of balance was on base products. So the fact is, as we see base work go with greater vigor in almost every market that we're in, that goes a long way toward curing the imbalance. But no, we do not see that as a pricing issue, Jack.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Second question is, in the risks section of the press release, you talk about fiscal issues and risks to transportation budgets and spending. And it mentions North Carolina, which of course is a very important state to you guys. Is there something specific going on there that you see that's changed in the last 3 or 6 months with regard to the outlook in North Carolina for transportation spending?","Anne H. Lloyd","Jack, this is Anne. There's not. I mean, that really we're -- that is a pretty standard issue. As you know, North Carolina disproportionately affects profitability. And so we make sure that we highlight that. And back to our whole commentary as the southeastern corner of the United States begins to recover, then you get a disproportionate impact on profit.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And there's another comment about some markets in the West being now in growth mode when you kind of look at the cycle from bigger picture perspective and we know Texas has been and still is a great market. And I guess you're calling out some improvements in Colorado. Is that where the change is coming in terms of more markets being in growth mode?","C. Howard Nye","I think that's entirely what we are seeing there. I mean, part of what we anticipate in Colorado, for example, Jack, is we're looking to put a midyear price increase in ready-mix in Denver of $6 a cubic yard. That's already be sent to the marketplace. But again, if you're looking at that type of a midyear price increase on ready-mix in a market like Denver, and I think that gives you a pretty good sense of what that growth looks like. And based on a Colorado budget, based on what their RAMP program is doing and based on what the flood relief dollars will look like in that market, we anticipate that market being pretty strong, not for a matter of months but rather for a matter of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Olin of Cleveland Research.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","Just wanted to talk a little bit 2 big picture questions. The first is the TIFIA spending contribution. I guess, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that going forward and how your assets may be positioned. Are you winning some of these projects that are getting released?","C. Howard Nye","Look, I think we look at it the same way we talked about it for a while in that is we think it's going to make a profound difference. We have been disappointed, as I'm sure you have been too, at a pace with which it's come out. Given the pacing at least relative to 2014, we put our plan together as if there would be no TIFIA activity in our plans. So to the extent TIFIA really starts hitting it hard this year, frankly, it will hit it harder next year, it would simply be an upside. I mean here's what we know. Look, all the awards are likely to be done or -- well, they had to be done before the expiration of the highway bill. The total applications right now exceed $51 billion. If we look at the states in which we participate, ongoing applications right now are $18.5 billion. If we look at places that it's been approved, northwest Carter [ph] in Atlanta; downtown Richardson, Kentucky; and The Grand Parkway in Texas, my guess is you're going to see TIFIA dollars go into the hot lanes on I-77 and Charlotte. You're likely to see TIFIA dollars go into the ultimate I-4 in Florida, that's just been let. And again, these are states in which our infrastructure presence tends to be pretty profound. So again, if you're seeing Texas come back with $35 billion with the TIFIA applications, North Carolina over $1 billion and Florida with several billion, with the footprint that we have in those states and our ability to supply, particularly in those granted markets, good quality DOT stone, we feel like it will make a nice difference for us. And again, we feel like we are disproportionately located in areas that will benefit from that. I think whether it's TIFIA or whether it's residential or whether it's non-res, this is a year and I think next year will too where, where you are matters disproportionately. And I think our where is in our favor.","Christopher David Olin - Cleveland Research Company","Good. That is helpful. And then secondly, I know it's somewhat early, but looking at the potential impact of the investment in port capacity, port expansion related to the Panama Canal, I mean, how do you think about that? Do you think you're positioned well? Are you seeing anything?","C. Howard Nye","I do think we're positioned well because, remember, a lot of stone in those markets will end up coming in by rails to different areas. And we're the largest movers -- so if you think about the markets that can be impacted, it's going to be going from South Texas across the gulf and into Florida. And we are, of course, the largest mover of stone by rail on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the Union Pacific and the Kansas City Southern, #1 on CSX and #2 on NS. So our ability to move stone to those markets in what we feel like are importantly strategically placed sales yards is very attractive. And of course we're also coming out of Bahamas by boat and Nova Scotia by boat. So our ability to hit it by water and by land is very impressive, and we like where we are there, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you could talk about the, I guess, range of areas where you're putting in an April 1 price increase, if you could just quantify it as what proportion of your served markets and how is that different this year versus last year? It sounds like you may have more gotten more Jan 1 than April 1 increases last year which maybe is driving the variance this quarter. Is that the right, Ward? Can you just frame that for us?","C. Howard Nye","I think the variance for the quarter is really -- it's geography and it's product, Jerry. And I think that was really more the story than anything else. And candidly, I don't think the April to January delta was really that much different this year than last year because it tends to be, oddly enough, in more the cold-weather states anyway. So at the end of the day, I'm not sure really going in April puts you behind in any meaningful way. So I continue to believe the pricing story this quarter is just what we've outlined. It's a mix issue on both sides of the mix debate.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you've outlined a pickup in the Southeast would be pretty positive from a mix standpoint. Can you just talk about the lead times that you see in your business by each of your 3 reported geographies? Are you seeing that manifest itself in the backlog? Do you have more visibility in that market than the 2 other reported regions?","C. Howard Nye","I think we are clearly having more visibility into a res market, because there is a res market now. And we're having more visibility into a non-res market. I think both of those. And now I'm not necessarily talking about reporting units; I'm just talking broadly geographically. I think both of those are much clearer and better for us now in the Southeastern United States, and by that I mean Virginia all the way through to Carolinas and into Georgia and Alabama, than it's been for a while. We also are not seeing anything that feels like it's taking a step backward in any of those states relative to infrastructure either and I think that's an important piece of it. So as we're looking at what's going on in those states in our business, really across the board, it feels considerably better. I think part of what I've been particularly moved by as we come back and take a look at Florida, which was such a tough state for everybody through the downturn. I mean, right now, Florida is #4 in the United States on pure growth that it's seeing. And Governor Rick Scott has just announced an $8.8 billion DOT budget for fiscal year '15 and they have also just finished awarding the ultimate I-4 bid in Seminole County to the Skanska Granite and Lane [ph] team. That's a $2.3 billion project that they'll get a notice to proceed on later this summer. I mean, that's the type of visibility that we're seeing on res, non-res and these large infrastructure projects in that part of the world that we haven't seen for a while, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And you mentioned you're shipping on any day that you could in the first quarter and you still had really excellent year-over-year volume performance. I'm wondering if the momentum is continuing to a similar extent in 2Q. Could you see double-digit volume growth in 2Q in this business based on what you're seeing today?","C. Howard Nye","Well, I would tell you all about Q2 when we come back at half year. But again, we've talked about momentum building from Q4 into Q1. So I think the primary swing factor is going to be what either does happen or doesn't happen in Washington D.C. If Washington doesn't get in the way, I think it could be pretty impressive.","Anne H. Lloyd","So and just a reminder, we have -- the second quarter 2013 volumes were down almost 2%, and they picked up pretty strong in April but then deteriorated very quickly in May and June, so -- because of the rain we had last year. So the comps in the second quarter, assuming we have a normal spring as opposed to a rainy, rainy spring, are pretty helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Real quick, Ward. I think you were saying that you expect a geographic shift as we go throughout the year, which you mentioned will help to bridge that gap on overall pricing. And then also, Anne, you touched on Southeast markets, and North Carolina having disproportionate impact to profits. With your outlook for kind of a geographic mix shift here kind of as we look in the next few quarters, how should we be thinking about the impact to incremental margins in that scenario?","C. Howard Nye","Clearly, it's going to be very kind to incremental margins in that scenario. The fact is, if we go back and take a look at what incremental margins are, really just for the aggregates product line, if we go back and really normalize for that $5 million of extra expense that we felt like we had because of the extraordinary weather, I mean, the odd thing is even with a pretty challenged volume quarter, what I'll tell you is we comfortably outperformed the target that we have out there for incremental margins. So we feel pretty good about it and, again, that's just normalizing for the $5 million, Trey.","Anne H. Lloyd","And Trey, we've said incremental margins we think are in the 60% on average, which means that those markets in that southeastern quadrant of the U.S. likely have incrementals in excess of that.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. That's encouraging. Lastly, res strength that you're seeing, Ward, it's kind of what we've seen from the builders and starts and orders have kind of been kind of lackluster the last few months at least. And it sounds like you're seeing a little bit of a different story here. Is that more of the, what you're seeing, more of the infrastructure side of res, like the streets and the sidewalks within the new neighborhood? Or more of the kind of leading indicator to starts type work? Or is this just your typical slabs, driveways, that sort of thing?","C. Howard Nye","Trey, I think it's better across the entire spectrum and we are seeing more subdivisions. So are lots being built out? Yes. And we saw some of that last year. Are we now seeing more subdivisions? I think the answer to that is yes too. Here's where I think the difference is on housing. We are back to that notion we discussed before about being where you are. If I look at Denver, housing is good in Denver, and it's going to stay good in Denver. Housing is really attractive in DFW, it's attractive in San Antonio, it's attractive in Houston, it's recovering in Atlanta, it's nice in Charlotte, it's recovering in Raleigh. That's the March that we had. I think if we had a much more Midwest\/Northeast-based business, we would probably have a very different story. So I think on the story on housing and frankly on non-res I think that Southeast\/Southwest predominant footprint right now is our friend. I think that's the delta in the story.","Anne H. Lloyd","Trey, I think if you listen closely to the mortgage lenders and home builders, they will echo a very similar finding, that it really is a very regional market right now. Fortunately, we're in those regions that are seeing the improvement.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Good. And I do have one last one if I could slip it in. Ward, on your mention earlier of a lot of base rock in the mix. You said that seems to be a good indicator of new work starting. But what is the typical lag between seeing the increase in base rock like we did in 1Q, the lag before it starts to shift to the work that is behind it as you said that would likely be higher ASP rock?","C. Howard Nye","And I think it's going to vary by what the end use is. If it's going to an infrastructure job that's a big new job, it's going to be longer than it's going to be if it's going to a non-res job. So again, if you come back and take a look at how nicely non-res moved, those projects tend to be of shorter duration. You will see the base rock go down, you will see the clean stone come back on top of it, all very much typically within a construction season or maybe within a quarter or 2. So I think the fact that you're seeing non-res move actually in a very positive fashion is more helpful toward compression -- compressing the time constraint that you're talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was hoping to ask you a question on the Western region. Volume was up 21%, 22%. And Ward, that was really helpful, the laundry list of items that you kind of walked through. But few of those numbers struck me as being even at 20%. So is that an apples-to-apples number? Is that organic growth? Are there a couple onetime projects? I know you talked about strength in Texas and Colorado in energy. But I'm just trying to help square up 21.5% growth.","C. Howard Nye","Ted, it's all apples to apples, and there is nothing particularly special in there other than I think really watching nice South Texas, good San Antonio, good Houston, much improved DFW. And then coming back to it just being a much better business year-over-year in Colorado. I think Colorado was really the sleeper because the notion I think that a lot of the people had is it's winter, it's snowing and not much is going to happen there. And we actually saw very attractive activity there. I mean, we're seeing ready-mix numbers nicely up year-over-year. We're seeing asphalt numbers nicely up year-over-year and aggregates as well. So I think it's pretty much across the spectrum in that market.","Anne H. Lloyd","Ted, we're -- I think we're seeing backlogs there 3 and 4x above this time prior year.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","It's up 3 or 4x in South Texas?","Anne H. Lloyd","So generally in that group, not specific region, but in that group.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that one of the keys to hitting the pricing target will be an improvement in Mid-America. Could you just talk about which states in particular you need to see that kind of that improvement to kind of realize the mix we're looking for?","C. Howard Nye","Look, I think if we see what we believe we're going to see North Carolina, with Charlotte having the type of recovery it's having, with the type of infrastructure work that we're seeing in Greensboro, with the improving economy that we're seeing in Raleigh East, clearly, North Carolina is going to be a disproportionate driver in that marketplace. And again, in what we're seeing in North Carolina right now, it feels pretty good to us.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. That's great. The last thing I was hoping to ask you is, Anne, you're always kind enough to give us kind of an EBITDA bridge, walk through the headwinds and tailwinds, I know you mentioned weather as being a $5 million headwind is the estimate. But could we just walk through that bridge and I'll jump back in queue there?","Anne H. Lloyd","Absolutely. For the aggregates product line, that's excluding the vertical businesses, volume contributed -- I'm rounding these numbers, volume contributed $17 million, pricing took away $1 million, cost increases took away $8 million, $5 million of that was weather. Our vertical businesses improved close to $4.5 million. Specialty Products was down about $1 million, mostly natural gas and weather-related. And then the corporate line was about $1.5 million. That's your bridge.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just so we understand, how do you calculate the $5 million weather? Or just how you come up with that proxy?","Anne H. Lloyd","We actually look at the production cost increase that occurred just -- with market by market working with our teams there locally. We also -- and principally, what was happening is, normally, during a cold winter, you don't do a lot of production. We had some markets where regardless of whether they wanted to do production or not, they needed to, to be able to be ready for the backlog and to meet the shipment demand. So your cost of doing business and operating in that extremely cold weather increase. So that was part of it. We also looked at projects that were deferred into the second quarter and looked at that impact on both the profitability and cost structure. So we just did a market-by-market build.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the last thing is just production volumes. Were production volumes up year-on-year or sequentially?","C. Howard Nye","They were actually down year-over-year. They were down about 2.4% so production was 23.8 million tons versus 24.4 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Ward, your comments about some of the states taking a more cautious approach toward kind of project commitments on the public sector side. It wasn't clear to me, have you seen the impact of that in some of those markets in terms of release of new work or is this kind of more of an expectation in the coming months?","C. Howard Nye","We have not seen it. It's something that they have said that they may be thinking about in the coming months. And here's the odd component of it. For example, one of the states that has said it is Colorado. If we go back to some of the comments that I shared with you, we're seeing so much private work in Colorado right now. Number one, we're not sure if they are going to have a slowdown. If they did have a slowdown, I don't think it affects us in that state in any meaningful way. So I think from the perspective of having caution out there, it's important for us to articulate to you that DOTs have said that. At the same time, when we come back and look at different marketplaces, the private side is so strong right now. I'm not sure that it's going to be particularly moving in a negative way for us in the states that are more impactful.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then this might be a little bit more difficult to answer at this stage, but I'll ask anyway. Any view on the kind of proposed Lafarge combination and in particular, what could be implications to MLM down the road within any adjacent markets you guys compete in?","C. Howard Nye","I'll probably just take a pass on that. But what I'll say is, clearly, I think there will be some overlap in some discrete markets in the United States. They're probably more concerned in other markets around the world, including Canada. So we'll see what comes out of that. But at the same time, we're a company that's always looking to responsibly grow its footprint, and you know what our style is, so if there's opportunity there, we would certainly like to be a part of it.","Operator","Our final question comes from Sam Dubinsky of Wells Fargo.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of housekeeping ones. Shipments went up 8% in Q1, but you saw a 13% increase in March. How much of that 13% increase do you think is pent up demand from weather improving versus organic growth? And maybe could you comment on how April is shaping out?","C. Howard Nye","What we -- we'll tell you more about April later in the year. And look, I think if you really look at it, weather, I think, clearly had an impact in certain parts of the country where it was just bitterly cold. I mean, to put no finer point on it, they had a frost in parts of the Midwest that went down deeper than 3 feet if you can even imagine that. So work in really an Omaha or a Des Moines was going to be very difficult to get. Work in Texas, because weather permitted it, worked pretty well. And work in Colorado, when it was clear, worked pretty well. So I do think, again, back to the word that we used before, there was momentum coming out of Q4. And I think January and February just really were what they were.","Anne H. Lloyd","Sam, we actually saw volume growth each month during the quarter. It accelerated as we got to March, but that is not uncommon.","C. Howard Nye","So if you look at it, January was up actually 2%, February was up for us 8% and March was up 13.4%. So to Anne's point, it was a slow, steady build and not really that big of a surprise.","Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just my last question is, and I know you talked about, I think, 60% incremental margins, but if we were to sort of extrapolate this year's growth in volumes, and let's say we get somewhere halfway between now and sort of the last peak cycle, where do you think cost per ton is? Do you think it would be comparable or has there been any escalators over the past several years in the cost side?","C. Howard Nye","With cost per ton, if we have that kind of volume recovery, it's actually going to be pretty attractive because we're not going to add a lot of headcount to it. And remember, that's going to be 25% of your cost of goods sold. So if you go back to that notion of recovering half the volume that we've lost, and keep in mind, if we did that, that's 40 million tons of stone. Look, if we pick up 40 million tons of stone on the cost profile that we have today, the cost per ton is going to be going nicely down. And what I would tell you under that kind of volume recovery, I think the average selling price is going to be a great story again, too.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Ward Nye for any further remarks.","C. Howard Nye","Thanks again for joining our first quarter earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ward Nye, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.","C. Howard Nye","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials' quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're pleased to report second quarter 2013 results, which reflect growth in net sales and gross margin.","As an initial reminder, this discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our earnings release relating to our second quarter 2013 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","As today's press release outlined, our second quarter net sales increased 4%, driven by pricing growth in all Aggregates business product lines and reportable segments, as well as a new quarterly net sales record established by our Specialty Products business. The overall net sales increase is noteworthy considering the number of record rainfall levels in most of our key markets. To elaborate, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has tracked levels of precipitation for 119 years. Across this period, 2013 represented the wettest second quarter ever for Iowa. Rainfall was also excessive throughout Georgia, more than double the average levels in many markets, including Augusta, which reported its wettest month in weather history in June. Not surprisingly, weather-constrained shipments and production also affected our net earnings. Although it's difficult to isolate all of this quarter's weather impact, we know it was considerable in at least 3 specific areas.","First, there were deferred product sales. Our estimate is that mostly heavy construction shipments were reduced by 1.5 million to 1.7 million tons alone, lowering net earnings up to $0.11 per diluted share.","Second, throughput challenges created by extraordinary rainfall in predominantly open pit quarries significantly reduced operational efficiencies. Additionally, lower production volumes likely led to an underabsorption of fixed costs. The latter 2 items are more difficult to reasonably quantify than deferred sales. Therefore, we've not provided an estimate of their impact.","Considering that backdrop, we were very pleased with net earnings that, on an apples-to-apples basis, were broadly similar to the comparable prior year quarter. As noted, while weather conditions hindered our short-term results, we continue to see positive indicators for increased long-term construction activity. On a year-to-date basis, private construction reported double-digit growth and further expansion is forecasted. Residential construction traditionally is the primary driver of many nonresidential and infrastructure projects. We expect this trend to continue and anticipate opportunities in our markets.","During the quarter, pricing momentum continued for the Aggregates business as evidenced by pricing growth in each reportable group. The West Group led with a 2.8% increase over the prior year quarter. This was attributable to pricing increases implemented over the past year. In particular, pricing was most favorable in the Texas markets.","The Mid-America and Southeast Groups reported average selling price increases in the second quarter of 1.9% and 0.4%, respectively. Of note, southeastern pricing was negatively impacted by reduced offshore shipments due to a production shortfall dictated by a ship loader repair issue that has now been resolved. On a year-to-date basis through June 30, our aggregates product line pricing rose more than 3%, leading us to reaffirm our full year pricing guidance of increasing 2% to 4%.","And while the more significant benefit will be experienced in 2014, recently implemented midyear pricing increases reinforced pricing momentum. We also are especially pleased to report average selling price growth in our vertically integrated businesses, namely the ready mixed concrete and hot mixed asphalt product lines, reporting pricing growth of 8.3% and 4.3%, respectively, over the prior year quarter. We believe pricing improvement in downstream businesses, in addition to enhancing profitability, provides a strong indicator of the health of local construction markets and bodes well for future conditions.","Consistent with the national trend in private sector construction, 3 of our 4 aggregates product line end-use markets reported shipment growth. Leading the way was the nonresidential market, which accounted for approximately 30% of quarterly shipments and increased 7% over the prior year quarter.","Growth in the commercial component, namely office and retail, was partially offset by a decline in energy sector shipments, the result of a modest slowdown in shale oil field activity.","The residential end-use market continues to satisfactory and sustainable recovery. Both housing starts and completions reported double-digit growth on a year-to-date basis over the comparable prior year period. For the full year, housing starts are expected to approximate 1 million, a level last seen in 2007. Encouragingly, third-party forecasts predict continued growth in housing starts. For the quarter, this end-use market accounted for 13% of aggregates product line shipments and had growth of 4% more than the prior year quarter.","Lastly, our ChemRock and Rail end-use market accounted for 10% of quarterly shipments and grew 2% over the prior year quarter.","Public sector construction has not kept up with private sector growth. While weather was a factor, delayed demand on large infrastructure projects and lower governmental spending contributed to an 8% decline in infrastructure shipments and overall reduction in aggregates product line shipments of 1.6%, both compared with the prior year quarter. We believe this slowdown represents a short-term step backward given the well-documented deficiencies in the nation's transportation system, increased state-level funding initiatives, as well as positive indicators of long-term growth. Consistent with the cycle we are experiencing in Texas, we anticipate increases in private sector construction in other geographic markets to stimulate growth in public sector construction to serve an expanding economy and population. We note early signs of this in Colorado and Georgia and are well positioned in both of those states for future growth.","We are encouraged to see other key states, namely South Carolina and Indiana, increase funding for repair of existing roads and to construct new roads. South Carolina recently increased its budget by $500 million to fund repairs of existing roads, while Indiana approved up to an additional $415 million in annual funding for the construction of new roads and expansion of major highways. Additionally, the highway contract awards activity increased double digits in several states important to Martin Marietta, including Colorado and Georgia.","Texas also reported strong award levels consistent with their stated expectation to let nearly $8 billion of projects in fiscal 2013. Texas has been proactive in applying for awards under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA. To date, the U.S. Department of Transportation has received applications for $42 billion of projects, inclusive of $7 billion in Texas, more than $1 billion in North Carolina and over $2.5 billion in Florida. While the DOT has not moved as expeditiously as many hoped, we still expect several awards to be made in 2013. Still, consistent with our previous viewpoint, we do not anticipate any meaningful impact from TIFIA projects before next year. We remain confident that TIFIA funding can ultimately support between $30 billion and $50 billion of incremental construction projects.","Our Specialty Products business continued its strong performance, establishing a new record as net sales of $56.6 million increased 12% over the prior year quarter. Sales growth for the dolomitic lime product line reflect shipments from the new kiln that became operational in the fourth quarter of 2012, partially offset by a decline in domestic steel production compared with the prior year quarter. Gross margin was 37.6%, a decline of 190 basis points, resulting from higher cost for natural gas and repairs. Overall, this business contributed $18.7 million of earnings from operations for the quarter.","Despite weather interruptions, our operating teams' continued cost control focus contributed to a 20 basis point increase in consolidated gross margin. The Mid-America Group, led by the performance of the Mid-Atlantic Division, which includes Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, achieved a 150 basis point improvement in gross margin. Specifically, the Mid-Atlantic Division leveraged a 10% increase in aggregates product line shipments into an incremental gross margin that exceeded 100%. Direct production costs for the aggregates product line increased 4%, driven by the previously discussed weather impact, together with increases in costs for supplies, as well as maintenance and repair. For example, the Southeast Group's unplanned shipload repairs mentioned earlier negatively affected these quarterly costs and gross profit by $1.1 million.","Consolidated selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of net sales were 7.4%, up 20 basis points compared with the prior year quarter. On an absolute basis, these costs increased $2.6 million, largely due to expenses related to our planned information systems upgrade expected to be completed later this year.","Consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $69.4 million compared with $59.2 million in the prior year quarter. Recall that 2012 quarterly earnings reflected $9 million or $0.12 per diluted share of business development expenses.","For the first 6 months of the year, we generated operating cash flow of $48.5 million. We made prudent capital investments of $50 million while maintaining our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At June 30, our ratio consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.17x in compliance with the limits under our debt covenant.","During the quarter, we established a new 1-year $150 million trade receivable securitization facility, which replaced the $100 million facility that expired by its own terms. The new facility can be increased by as much as $100 million, subject to our trade receivables balance. Borrowings bear interest at 1-month LIBOR plus 60 basis points, a reduction of 15 basis points compared to the prior agreement, as well as the arbitrage generated by the increased facility size.","Earlier this month, we finalized the purchase of our previously announced acquisition of 3 aggregates facilities in the greater Atlanta area. This transaction expanded our geographic footprint and added over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves, thereby providing an enhanced valuable long-term position. The integration of these operations is now complete. We look forward to the contributions from our new quarries and employees.","The inevitable question is this, what's the outlook? We're encouraged by various positive trends in our business end markets, especially in product pricing and in private sector activity. We anticipate volumes to the nonresidential end-use market will increase in the mid-single digits given the Architecture Billings Index, or ABI, which is the leading economic indicator for nonres construction activity, remains at a strong level. Residential construction is experiencing a level of growth not seen since late 2005, with seasonally adjusted starts ahead of any period since 2007. We believe this trend in housing starts will continue, and our residential end-use market will experience double-digit volume growth. By contrast, the weather-related slowdown in aggregate shipments experienced in the first half of the year, coupled with the delay in large infrastructure projects moving through the public letting cycle, lead us to expect aggregate shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to be down in the mid-single digits for the full year. Our ChemRock\/Rail end-use market is expected to be flat with 2012. Cumulatively, we anticipate aggregates product line shipments will increase 1% to 3%.","As previously indicated, we currently expect aggregates product line pricing will increase 2% to 4%, although this increase is not expected to be uniform across the company. We expect our vertically integrated businesses to generate between $350 million and $375 million of net sales and $20 million to $22 million of gross profit. Aggregates product line direct production cost per ton are expected to be flat with 2012.","Net sales for the Specialty Products segment should range from $220 million to $230 million, generating $81 million to $85 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices are 2 key drivers for this segment.","SG&A expenses, excluding costs in 2013 and 2012 related to the information systems upgrade, as a percentage of net sales, are expected to slightly decline. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively flat compared with 2012. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 26%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million.","To conclude, we believe underlying demand for increased construction activity continues to exist. We anticipate the current growth in the private sector to lead to increased public sector construction. We are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and thereby enhance long-term value for our shareholders.","Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","First, a clarifying question. I know you mentioned the impact of weather directly on volume was $0.13 or so. I guess, my question is, can you -- I know you couldn't formally quantify, but can you give us a little better feel perhaps for the productivity hit that weather may have caused or some other way for us to gauge the weather impact in Q2?","C. Howard Nye","Sure, Arnie. Probably the best way for you to think about this is the way that I look at it, and that is I look at our tons produced per working man-hour a quarter -- of a quarter same quarter last year. We were down on tons produced per working man-hour about 3.6% over where we were in Q2 in '12. Our headcount hasn't changed materially at all. So when we come back and take a look at that number, what it tells me is when we have teams working in our quarries and it's wet and screens are being blanked out and you're having trouble moving product efficiently and crushing it, I think that's as good a direct correlation as I can give you. A 3.5% movement is pretty considerable. And the areas that got dumped with rain, as you can tell from the commentary and from the release, got an enormous amount of rain.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And I know it's a business model, you never discuss midyear price increases until they're basically implemented. Now that we're past midyear, can you comment on the scope and breadth of midyear price increases that have been implemented?","C. Howard Nye","Sure. As you recall, last year, we announced midyear price increases really in only 2 distinct markets. We talked about them in Houston and we spoke to them in San Antonio. This year, what we're seeing is more geographic spread. For example, I won't go through the specific increases, but we've seen midyear price increases in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina, portions of downstream business in San Antonio. We've seen certain midyear price increases in North Texas. We've seen them in Houston. We've seen them in South Texas. We've seen them in portions of our business in North Georgia. We've seen them offshore, and we've also seen them in South Georgia. So on a compare, Arnie, that's part of what led me to say in the telecon that we're seeing good pricing strength and momentum, and this is actually a much better story this year than it was last year.","Operator","Our next question is from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","First, following up on pricing. For your fiscal '13 pricing guidance, it's unchanged for the year, but you are taking some pricing actions midyear. How much does the second half guidance take into account this -- the price increases? Or will the price increases really impact more 2014 pricing?","C. Howard Nye","Kathryn, I think the price increases will more impact 2014. I think if we look at it historically, what we would see is the midyear price increase might affect around 25% of your business for the remainder of the year. And really, it's simply setting a higher bar as you go into the following year. If you think back to the comments that I had, I commented that the pricing in Texas for the West Group really led the way, and the reason that, that was happening is what we saw last year in San Antonio and Houston. So if that trend follows into '14, as it did into '13, that's how I would think about that benefit.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","And how much do you think that volumes lost in Q2 can be captured in the back half of '13 and maybe give an early read on Q3 in terms of weather and volume dynamics?","C. Howard Nye","Well, I'd say -- well, I really -- I'll address Q3 when we come back and talk to you later in the fall. I'll talk a little bit about what we're thinking for the rest of the year, because if you take a look at the volume guidance that we're giving, really what we're saying with one to 3 in first range of, I want to say, 130 million to 132 million. So what thats saying is your implied volume in the second half of the year has to be, again call it, on the low end, 72 million; on the higher end, 74 million tons. Kathryn, I think a good way to think about this is go back and take a look at half 2 in 2010. 2010 was not necessarily a great volume year, it was a great year in our business, but go back and take a look at that. We had pretty good weather in Q4, that was important. But in 2010, in the second half, particularly in Q4, was one of the few times that we saw up volume across our entire enterprise and 2 things happened: the volume came through nicely, volume flowed; and we had, I want to say, around 70 million tons in half 2 in 2010. And we saw the types of incremental margins that we would like to see, again with volume up across the profile. The reason that I think of it that way, business to me feels better today than it did in 2010. And so when we look at what the second half volume guidance is, I think if you're looking half on half, that's not a bad way to at least go back and reflect on it.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","So you're saying volumes aren't lost, but the majority can be captured in the second half, that maybe some will trickle into 2014?","C. Howard Nye","Yes. I think that would certainly be the case. Think of it this way, Kathryn. Let's talk about our business in the Midwest in Iowa. Iowa, as we discussed in the first quarter, had a real winter this year as opposed to what they didn't have last you. They had the wettest June in history. You've got concerns about whether farmers can even plant some of their crops this year. So if we're looking at our business in Iowa, if you think of it as the bookshelf, you had a book in, shove it in pretty hard from the left. One of the real concerns I've got is what it's going to look like as we go into Q4. If we have a relatively mild dry winter and can run, I think a lot of what we've seen pushed off can be recovered. If we have a relatively early winter, I think it's going to be tough to recover that volume this year. That said, I mentioned that I thought most of the volume loss was on the heavy side, I think it's infrastructure work. And as you know, unlike commercial or other work, the infrastructure work doesn't tend to go away. So I don't view that as lost volume. The great question is going to be, can it be captured this year?","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","And how much does mix versus volumes impact gross margins in the West Group in the quarter?","C. Howard Nye","You didn't have significant mix issues in the West Group in the fourth quarter. I mean, we had some mix issues in parts of our business, but I wouldn't say it was a big deal in the West Group. Ironically, some of the mixed issues that we saw that's being more profound are some of the mix issues we actually saw in parts of the Carolinas that I view as indicative of an economy that is slowly recovering. And here's the way to think about that, Kathryn. Our base work in North Carolina was up 14%. Our sand sales were up 37%. And riprap, ironically, despite the rain, was down 12%, I've got to think that's still to come. But what's notable about that is as you go through the food chain on different products, as we discussed before, base is one of your lower priced products on a relative basis as is sand, and riprap tends to be a higher price. So if I look at the West, I don't see any real mix issue there at all that was necessarily favorable to us. And actually, I could cite some mix issues in some places that was not necessarily our friend on the raw pricing component.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","So volume was a greater impact on the West Group?","C. Howard Nye","No question. Absolutely, Kathryn.","Operator","Our next question is from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","On the ship loader issue, did that have an impact on the average price that you can quantify at all?","C. Howard Nye","It did, Todd, because what happens, as you know, that's a long-haul process. You're coming out of Bahamas, you're typically coming into either a series of ports in Florida or you might be doing direct deliveries to the Caribbean. What I'll tell you is for the quarter, it probably reduced pricing in the Southeast by around 50 bps. And in June, all by itself for the Southeast, probably around 65 bps.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And do you feel like you gave up any volumes related to that? Or were you able to back and fill from other areas?","C. Howard Nye","Again, I don't think we necessarily gave up volumes on that, Todd. I think the question is going to be, do you recover some of those in the second half? If that's going to be a marine limestone product, it's going to be finding its way more infrastructural activities than others. So there's certainly more of a possibility in that, if it's apartment or other types of construction that you might have lost that volume. But I think part of what's most important to us now is that ship loader is back, running. It's in good shape, and we're operating the way that we want to operate.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","To restate that just a little bit, do you feel like any of the -- do you feel like you had a negative impact during the second quarter from having that ship loader down?","C. Howard Nye","Yes. I think we did, and then I don't think it was tremendous, Todd, but I think that we did. And I think the other thing that I would say is, if I'm looking at our volumes in Florida, they were up 8% for the quarter, and that's part of what leads me to believe that we probably did lose some volume there because that's an economy that, as we've seen, is slowly getting its legs back under it.","Anne H. Lloyd","And Todd, that impact was not only on the lost volume but obviously the cost as we indicated, too.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Sure. On the volume guidance for the second half, I think you're sort of quantifying that 130 million, 132 million. Are you assuming for the back half of the year, specifically, if you change your expectations of that at all? Or is, basically, the decline in -- or the reduction in guidance due to the shortfall in the second quarter?","C. Howard Nye","Todd, I think the reduction is really to what's happened so far through half one. I mean, so if you take a look at what happened in the first quarter, as we said, it was a real winter. I think what just was extraordinary is really what happened in June. And one of our healthiest markets right now, if you think back to the conversations we've had, we said part of the differentiator we have this year are markets like Texas, Iowa and Colorado. So if we look at Iowa right now, Todd, I don't think any business has been lost there. My guess is if we spoke to our team out there, their biggest concern is, can we take care of the business that's left? And can we really get it all done this year? So I mean, that's how that feels to me. As I look at Colorado for the second half, remember, part of what we discussed is that new RAMP program in Colorado on maintenance. Remember, that didn't become law until we went into the new fiscal year, which is all 30 days old. So my sense always was that Denver and Colorado was going to be a back-loaded process this year. Although what we've seen in the first half feels better than it did last year. And then with respect to Texas, remember what we said about Texas, the single biggest concern we had around Texas was whether TxDOT really let all of the work that they said that they were going to let. And of course, they've come back now and taken their guidance down to about $7.7 billion worth of lettings this year. And what that's really effectively done is taking a big chunk of lettings, or at least the significant piece of it, and moved it into 2014. So hopefully, that type of data in the West, combined with what we just talked about in the previous part of your question with respect to Florida, gives you some help on that.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Absolutely. On the infrastructure, just one or 2 more. Thinking a little bit longer term, I guess, I mean, down 8% in the quarter was significant. You alluded in your comments to the idea that volumes were deferred mostly on the heavy infrastructure projects. And is -- are you suggesting that weather was more of an impact on that side than on the product side?","C. Howard Nye","I don't think that there's any question that it was more on that because you're moving more dirt and otherwise. Rain isn't necessarily going to stop some portions of home-building or commercial construction the way that it does heavy. And the other thing that I would tell you, Todd, is when you're looking at the percentages, remember, percentages can look huge on these types of numbers. I mean, here's the way to think about it. I mentioned to you that our volumes were up in Florida, 8%. I gave you that because we're talking about a single digit number down on infrastructure. 8% up in volumes in Florida means 60,000 tons. We actually saw volumes up 13% in the eastern half of North Carolina. In other words, the part of the state can -- they can actually take heavy rains but percolate through and 13% up in Eastern North Carolina means a whopping 250,000 tons. So these percentages, based on today's numbers, are tough to really sort your way through until you go back and look at what the base numbers are. It reminds me a lot of the way that we look at housing. I mean, housing on a percentage basis can be way up, and you're still seeing a number that is considerably below a 50-year average.","Operator","Our next question is from Ted Grace of Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Maybe the starting point and you're often kind enough to give us kind of an EBITDA bridge. Is there any chance you could just kind of start there to help us understand the key puts and takes in the quarter?","Anne H. Lloyd","Sure. Give me one second. Yes, if you look -- no, that's the [indiscernible] numbers, he wants the quarter number. If you look at the quarter, pricing generated about $6.3 million of gross profit. Volume took away about $6 million. Cost improved $1.6 million. And then, both our vertically integrated operations and Specialty Products contributed about $1.4 million each to gross profit for the quarter.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So okay. That's helpful. And then in the cost side, I was just wondering if you could through some of the more granular level. I know Ward mentioned that tons produced per working man-hour was down 3%, but could you maybe just help us understand kind of the key buckets within the cost side and any impact they had?","Anne H. Lloyd","Yes. The key buckets on the cost side, obviously, we indicated that repairs were high in the Southeast. That was directly related to the ship. That ship loader was about $1.1 million of production cost increase there. Our fuel was up. Nat gas was up about 47% in the Specialty Products business, had a little bit of an increase in fuel cost in the Aggregates business.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, the thing I'm trying to figure out is the comments you've made on flat direct costs. And the way we've kind of thought about your direct costs is just look at the pure aggregate sales and gross profits to more directly relative to external tons. And in the first half, if I've got my math right, it's up the better part of 5% and I know you've talked about it being flat. So I'm just wondering, a, does that imply that in the back half, it's down? And is that just better fixed cost absorption, something of that sort? Or is there a different from the math that we would look at based on your disclosed financials versus the way you talk about the business?","Anne H. Lloyd","I would say that you're exactly right. Our view is that with the volume in the second half of the year, you have better absorption and better cost profile period because your productivity measures should be higher.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So then it's -- okay. So that ties out to kind of the way you're tracking. You're actually up 5% year-to-date and it just improves to go flat next year?","Anne H. Lloyd","Correct.","C. Howard Nye","Exactly, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And so how would you encourage us to think about that kind of next year or more on a normalized basis?","Anne H. Lloyd","Well, we usually provide you with what we think cost per ton is going to be doing from an annual basis when we give you guidance. I will update that and provide you insight into 2014. Obviously, it will depend on the volume, and you can make your assessments of volume for what you expect by the end use in 2014. And I would tell you that at our guidance now between 130 million to 132 million tons, you still are in a normalized cost profile. You're probably still running 70-30 fixed variable. And as you continue to move up that curve, you'll work your way back to kind of 60-40 variable fixed. So you can decide again what you think volume trajectory is going to be and apply some rational move of that cost profile.","C. Howard Nye","Ted, the other thing I would encourage to keep in mind is the biggest single driver on costs is going to what we do or don't do with personnel. And I can tell you, we are going to be very, very slow to hire as any recovery comes back. So you can watch that headcount line and what's going to happen with personnel, not be driven by host of new people coming into the business. Probably in that cost bucket, the ones that are going to be more variable at times is just what you would expect, it's going to be around energy. Remember, that's going to be around 12% of our cost of goods sold. Here's something for you to think about, though, even as we think about energy, and I know we've had some discussions before around Specialty Products group. Even as we look at what was a fairly dramatic spike with respect to energy for nat gas in that group, it was up, I want to say, 47% for the quarter, that translates to around $250,000. So what I think, I think there are a number of things that our operating teams do well. I think they do cost control really well. And I think as long as we maintain that headcount number in the right place and we continue to put capital in the right places, I think you'll like the cost story going forward.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Then the last thing I just wanted to ask and I'm going provide you with the opportunity to embarrass me here, but I guess the way I've always thought about this business is, the aggregates specifically, is every day we're pushing to get pricing, every deal is negotiated one-off, but there isn't such a thing or has never been such a thing or typically such a thing as midyear pricing increases because every day we're fighting for pricing. So am I off base with that kind of perspective? And I was wondering if you can just frame out, I know you highlighted some areas in which you got this midyear price increase, but could you walk through how many MSAs you actually imposed at a formal midyear end price increase versus just fighting for price every day?","C. Howard Nye","No, I guess, Ted, I would encourage you to think about it a little bit differently. I think the way that you're thinking about pricing is what it might have been around 10 years ago because I think it was more refined every day. I think it was more of a volume-driven marketplace than it is today. And I think if you go back and start looking realistically around 2004 or '05, the notion of midyear price increases started to come into the vernacular and customers started expecting that. I'll tell you, what drove it was some cement shortages and volatility in energy at that time because people are having a hard time keeping up with it. The notion of bidding a project over a 3- or a 4-year period without escalators also is something that went away. And so what I would tell you from the way that we approach our business, we want to make sure on that day-in and day-out business that you're referring to on a long-term project, we've got good escalators built into the agreement. Now what we're doing separate and distinct from that in these marketplaces that we're talking about across the U.S. today, we are coming back and putting in certain midyear price increases. As I look at it, to try to answer your question specifically, I see some degree of increases in Eastern North Carolina; South Carolina; parts of San Antonio downstream, that's 3; North Texas, some uncertain products, that's 4; Houston, again on certain products, that's 5; South Texas, on certain products, that's 6; North Georgia, on certain products, that's 7; we've seen some specific customers offshore, that's 8; some in South Georgia, that's 9; and some in West Virginia as well. So juxtaposing it to last year, to last year, around 10 this year. So that's the type of movement that we're seeing, Ted.","Anne H. Lloyd","And Ted, the other thing I would encourage you to do is if you -- as Ward indicated earlier, when we do a major price increase, it usually affects about 25% of our business. So when we mix -- that means that we've made a commitment on pricing, on that 75% of the business that really can't be adjusted or won't be adjusted until we come around for this time or to next year. So if you think about the contractual backlog that may be there from a sense of we're going to give a customer a requirement price for the year and so that price will be honored for the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Just first question is on the shale business. You said that you're seeing some modest slowdown there and it's been a source of strength in previous quarters. Just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what happened in the quarter, where and perhaps what the outlook is?","C. Howard Nye","I'd be happy to, Garik. If you think back to what our volume to shale looked like last year, it was a little bit more than 6 million tons. The way we're seeing it this year, it's probably going to be closer to 5.5 million, maybe a little bit off of that. Quarter-to-quarter, the variance, about 132,000 tons, so it's not an enormous variance. Here's the noise that I'm seeing on it. We continue to see, as we discussed last year, drops in Barnett and Haynesville, and in large part because that doesn't have the dual play of gas, as well as the oil. We've seen a moderate slowdown in Eagle Ford. But here's the flip side to it, we're seeing a pickup basically in the Mississippian and in the Marcellus as well. So what I would say is from a rig count perspective, Texas is down, like a little bit north of 6%. But if we're looking at Colorado, Ohio and West Virginia, all really very positive. I mean, percentage change in Colorado, again, Niobrara play, 4.6%. Ohio, I mean, in large part's driven by what's going to happen with Utica, up 88%. And if we look at West Virginia, again, the Marcellus play, up around 8.3%. So it's uneven. But as a whole, it is moderately down. I hope that helps, Garik.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","No, it does. And I guess, just switching to infrastructure. If I remember correctly coming out of the first quarter, you were looking for a mid-single-digit infrastructure growth. Now you lowered your expectations for this year to mid-single-digit declines. I can appreciate weather is playing a big role there. But just given the puts and takes of your various geographies and Texas putting up -- pushing out their letting schedule, however, Georgia is seeing an increase, it seems like a fairly sizable reduction in the infrastructure outlook, at least just optically. Is there anything going on that should have us concerned that the infrastructure outlook is actually deteriorating throughout the second quarter?","C. Howard Nye","Garik, I don't see it deteriorating. I'd see it staying in a lot of places relatively flat. I think North Carolina is a good example of that. I mean, we're seeing some recovery in private construction in this case, but a relatively flat DOT. I think what we're seeing with Texas, simply pushing some of their work to the right is something that we're mindful of. I think the issue that we've outlined in Iowa with respect to weather and whether we can really make that up over the balance of the year is a very fair question. And I think we will have to sit back and watch what's going to happen with the RAMP program in Colorado. It's going to work, it's going to do exactly what they said. I'm anxious to see how quickly it comes into the process. So I think more than anything, what we're sensitive to is really June was a washout in significant portions of our business, and that's in the middle of the season when you're expecting to be producing with high efficiency, selling with great efficiency and making sure that we can make that up in states like Indiana and Ohio and Nebraska and Iowa and Minnesota, all of which can be seasonally hit pretty hard at some point in Q4 is part of what gives us some caution around that.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And just lastly, on the Lafarge acquisition, the assets down in Georgia, can you provide us some benchmarks with respect to volumes that the quarries are producing, EBITDA that you've been able to pick up? If you could disclose the purchase price, that will be helpful. And then also, is any of the volume that you're picking up embedded in your 1% to 3% volume guidance for the full year?","C. Howard Nye","Garik, that's the market that, on a percentage basis, probably fell more than any other single market. We haven't given anything on the purchase price, and for agreement, we're not going to do that. What I can tell you is we didn't have to follow Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for that transaction, so that's going to give you a sense of the scope of it. And back to my point, we picked up over 0.75 billion tons of reserves in a market that we feel like it's going to be a very attractive long-term market. Now in total fairness, Garik, as we look at that deal, if people want to take the bare view that the southeastern United States has seen its greatest day and that population trends aren't going to continue to come there, and Atlanta, Georgia isn't going to be a driver of the southeastern economy, then I think coming back and saying that you really want to buy a #2 market position in Atlanta is a perfectly fair question. On the other hand, if we come back and say, that did give us the #2 position in Atlanta, we believe, based on population dynamics, it's going to be very powerful. Then picking up 800 million tons in that market feels awfully good. We haven't given any EBITDA numbers per se on that business. Obviously, that's a part of the United States that, right now, needs one thing predominantly and that one thing is volume.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And is the volume that you're picking up in the guidance for the full year?","C. Howard Nye","Yes. It's baked in there, Garik.","Operator","Our next question is from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","On residential, Ward, you still seem pretty positive there. And I was just wondering, you guys have stated many times that, over the years, that aggregates are really used more in subdivision work. You really need new development activity in housing to generate a lot of aggregate use. Are you seeing more of that now? I mean, is that kind of what underlies some of this ongoing confidence in residential in terms of what customers are telling you and what you see them planning?","C. Howard Nye","Jack, it is, and it's not even what we're seeing. And in fairness, I mean, it's spotty and it's different in the West is better. Candidly, part of what I liked about Q2 volumes is I'm looking at the spread of business: 47% infrastructure, 30% nonres, 13% res and 10% ChemRock\/Rail. That's starting to feel like a more normal spread, at least on a percentage basis, as this business really starts to grow. Part of what I continue to be moved by with respect to housing is while the June data was below expectations, and I think in fairness caused some concern, the 12-month rolling story, we think, still tells a good tale of what's going on. Building permits were 16.1% above the June 2012 estimate of 785,000. Housing starts were 10% above at a rate of 757,000. And housing completions were 20% above June 2012 at a rate of 628,000. So part of what we're looking at is completions need to increase by over 30% just to catch up with starts. And I think that ties back into the initial comments that we made. We feel good about what we're seeing in private construction. We're feeling increasingly good about what we believe that's doing to office and retail as well. I mean, if we're taking a look at what's happening with office and retail, again, I'd say this, Jack, because I think housing is driving some of this, a place like Charlotte is showing nice vacancy moves from over 20% to around 15% right now on office vacancy. And we're seeing the same types of numbers in industrial. For example, Orlando went from almost 20% vacancy rates down to 16%. So we think housing is driving a good bit of that. But as we come back and really look at it in our markets, to try to be more specific with you, we feel awfully good about what we're seeing in Colorado. Units are up there 68%. And get this, in North Carolina and Georgia, and we think this is incredibly important, they're up 32% in both of those states. And Texas, which has been healthy, obviously, for a while, units are still up 17%. So we feel like that on both the single and multifamily piece of it is helpful towards driving us to that 13% end number higher. We also think it's going to put more constitution in that 30% that's pure nonres.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. That's great. On SG&A, the press release mentions excluding cost in '13 and '12 related to information systems upgrade. SG&A will be down slightly as a percentage of sales. But on a reported basis, will the SG&A in the back half of the year kind of look like it did in the first half?","C. Howard Nye","Yes. I think it broadly will, Jack. I mean...","Anne H. Lloyd","We'll be through with the upgrade in the fourth quarter, so those costs will kind of roll through the rest of the year.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And so again, on a reported basis, next year we might see, I know you're not giving guidance for next year yet, but we might see a decline in SG&A dollars, all else equal, for that reason, right?","C. Howard Nye","Let's just say, if we're doing an upgrade next year, something went wrong.","Operator","Our next question is from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ward, can you talk about the outlook in each of the 3 reportable segments in the back half of the year? Which ones do you expect to put up better volume growth? Which ones is going to be tougher given the difference in pricing points that certainly has margin implications based on how much visibility you have between the different regions?","C. Howard Nye","Yes. We're talking different regions of the country, not different end users, is that what you're asking, Jerry? I just want to make sure I've got your question.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. So yes, exactly, Mideast, Southeast, West.","C. Howard Nye","Okay. I guess, from where I sit, the West Group continues to have the most upside right now. Again, I think Texas, the infrastructure work and housing and rising commercial in Texas, we think, has a good future ahead of it and we think will continue to be strong. I think the infrastructure work and the nonres work in Iowa will continue to be strong. We love Iowa. There are not a lot of people moving there, so I'm not saying the residential number is going through the roof, but I do think that's going to be good, steady business. And a lot of that's driven by the farm economy. The fact is that economy is just never gone down during this downturn. I think the story in Colorado continues to be a very powerful story. I think the infrastructure piece of that will be healthy. We're seeing a lot of bidding activity in that state right now, particularly in the metro and north of Denver. We continue to believe the residential story is going to be good, and the commercial story there is pretty good. We're pretty bullish on Colorado right now. We knew, coming across the Mississippi, that this was going to be a tougher year for a place like Indiana. The Major Moves is waning, but you're also seeing Indiana come back and put over $400 million into infrastructure in that state. So that business is right where we thought. In a state like Ohio, part of what I like I'm seeing there is sand sales are going up, which means ready mixed is getting better, which means single-family housing, multifamily housing and commercial is getting better in that market as well. As we come down and take a look at Virginia, and the fact is Virginia is sitting in a pretty attractive place, this isn't so much a rest of the year story, it's beyond that because they've come back. They've put in a new infrastructure funding program there. And we're going to see, over a 6-year period, billions of dollars more invested in Virginia than we've seen. If we look at North Carolina, Jerry, I think part of what's important is we do have a new Governor. We've got a Republican Legislature House and Senate. We haven't had this in North Carolina in 150 years. They're very dedicated to giving their fiscal house in order, which I think they're doing. Part of the transportation planning in North Carolina is putting more money into the urban areas. Now there's a bit of debate in some parts of the economy around that, which I get, but if you're Martin Marietta and you have a significant presence in the eastern part of the state, near New Bern and Wilmington, as well as Raleigh-Durham Chapel Hill and in Greensboro, High Point, Winston-Salem and Charlotte, that's not a bad place for us to be. As we look at what's going on in Southeast, again, that's the one that has gone down with the hardest thud over the last 4 or 5 years. But again, I'd take great heart in the fact that we're seeing the type of volume uptick in Florida that we're seeing. And again, we're starting to see housing come back in Georgia, and we're starting to see good employment numbers as well. So as we come back and think about what parts of the country we can feel largely better about, the job recovery that we're seeing now in Southeastern United States, as we discussed in the Q1 call, is starting to outpace the national average, and it hasn't been there for a while. I mean, here's something to think about. At the current pace, we're less than a year away to regaining peak employment. I mean, that's a great number for us to have in our minds because people with the job will either go and move into an apartment, build a home or otherwise. And God knows all those kids who are living with mom and dad want desperately to get out of there, their parents do as well. So we think the job situation is incredibly helpful for that. But if we come back and look at state employment change, again, to give you a sense of how we're looking at it, Texas and Colorado both lead in job growth and we're looking at a U.S. growth percentage of 1.5%. Texas is at 2.7%, Colorado is at 2.4%, and here you go, Georgia is at 2.2%, South Carolina at 1.7% and North Carolina at 1.7% and Florida, as well, ahead of the national average. So Jerry, that's -- I'm probably not answering your question, how does it feel in half 2, but to tell you the truth, what I'm looking at and I think what a lot of people were looking at are the long-term fundamentals that we're talking about as the industry continues to recover and where and why. And I think those are your drivers.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the downstream part of the business, you've spoken about a couple of areas where you're putting through additional price increases. I'm wondering if, based on the cadence of those price increase, you expect year-over-year pricing for asphalt and concrete to accelerate for your business in the back half of the year. I guess, how meaningful are those increases?","C. Howard Nye","I think in some places, in Texas, you'll see that. I'm not seeing a lot of that really in Colorado for the balance of the year, although we are already talking to customers in Colorado now about what we believe our price increases will be going into next year. And again, if we're taking a look on the ready mixed side in particular, our volumes in the quarter in ready mixed in Colorado were up 28%. If we look for the -- for half 1, they were up 30% there. So again, that's a very healthy market right now, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And what's your sense on the magnitude of downstream price increases that, in areas where you're not vertically integrated, your customers are seeing? Is it similar level of price -- pricing power that you're showing here with your concrete and asphalt business? Or how much variability is there in other regions where you're not integrated?","C. Howard Nye","I think there continues to be an emphasis, at least in our business, of coming back and revisiting where concrete stone pricing has been because that has been a sector that was hit pretty hard. And I think it's a practical matter. They were not seeing, at least from us, the types of price increases perhaps other sectors were. And I think there's some recovery there on that piece of it, Jerry.","Operator","Our next question is from Rohit Bhatia of Exane.","Rohit Bhatia - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division","My question has been answered.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time.

A question-and-answer session will follow the company\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.","Suzanne Osberg","Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today\u2019s discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q1 2019 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends.","As detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise.","We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. As a reminder, all financial and operating results discussed today are for the first quarter 2019. Any comparisons are versus the prior year first quarter unless otherwise noted and all margin references are based on revenue. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q1 2019 supplemental information and SEC filings.","We will begin today\u2019s earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our first quarter operating performance as well as market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow.","I will now turn the call over to Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today\u2019s teleconference. Martin Marietta had a first quarter performance provides a promising start to what we expect to be another record year for our company. Consolidated total revenues increased 17% to $939 million, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA increased 28% to $159 million both new first quarter records. We also achieved strong gains and other key financial metrics including a 140 basis point expansion in consolidated gross margin and earnings per diluted share of $0.68.","Notably, shipment volume and pricing improved across the majority of our building materials business including robust double-digit growth in aggregate shipments is more favorable weather allowed for an earlier onset to the construction season and our customers were able to begin addressing both prior year\u2019s weather deferred projects and current backlogs.","Consistent with our expectations, public and private sector construction growth in our leading markets is outpacing the nation as a whole and supports our view of continued pricing momentum. These trends bode well for increased construction activity and position Martin Marietta for improved shipments, pricing and profitability for the remainder of 2019.","We have consistently maintained that attractive market fundamentals including continued employment gains, population growth and superior state fiscal health will promote sustainable and long-term construction growth across our geographic footprint. Our first quarter results clearly demonstrated that robust underlying demand, demand that failed to translate into higher shipment volumes in 2018 due to contract or capacity constraints, logistics disruptions, and most significantly poor weather.","For example, our heritage mid-Atlantic division, which includes the Carolinas, Virginia and Maryland benefited from strong pent-up demand and more favorable weather conditions. These dynamics just to name a few resulted in heritage aggregate shipments that eclipsed the division\u2019s 2007 peak first quarter volumes. While winter weather traditionally limits the ability of outdoor contractors to perform work modestly improved weather in the first quarter of 2019 provided contractors the opportunity to advance both new and delayed projects.","The notable exception was in Colorado, the company\u2019s second largest state by revenues. Colorado experienced one of its harshest winters on record in terms of precipitation and temperatures, limiting construction activity and negatively affecting the aggregates, ready mix concrete and asphalt and paving businesses of our Rocky Mountain division.","Heritage aggregates shipments increased 12.5%, led by double-digit volume gains in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups. Importantly, all divisions with the exception of Rocky Mountain contributed to this robust shipment growth demonstrating the strength of Martin Marietta\u2019s markets and breadth of accelerating demand.","Heritage aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market increased 2% as modestly improved weather, particularly in the Southeast allowed customers to commence transportation-related projects earlier in the construction season. Importantly, our North Carolina, Georgia and Florida operations saw increased infrastructure activity during the quarter following the recent acceleration in public lettings and contract awards in these key states. Consistent with our expectations when we established 2019 guidance, we believe public construction, particularly for aggregates intensive highways and streets is poised for meaningful growth in 2019 and beyond driven by funding provided by the Fixing America\u2019s Surface and Transportation Act or FAST Act and numerous state and local funding initiatives.","Our top 10 states, which accounted for 85% of total building materials revenues in 2018, have all introduced incremental transportation funding measures within the last five years. Increased state level funding through bond issuances, toll roads and tax initiatives, is expected to continue to grow at a faster rate than near-term federal funding leading to additional growth opportunities for our company.","The infrastructure market represented 33% of our first quarter heritage aggregate shipments, which is below the company\u2019s most recent 10-year annual average of 46%, but consistent with first quarter historical trends. Heritage aggregates shipments to the non-residential market increased 33% as we continue to benefit from robust distribution center, warehouse, data center and wind turbine projects in key geographies including Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Iowa. Looking ahead, our non-residential construction and outlook remains positive with third-party forecasts including the Dodge Momentum Index projecting healthy commercial construction activity, particularly in our southeastern and southwestern regions.","Additionally, large energy sector projects along the Texas, Gulf Coast are expected to increase demand for heavy building materials. Throughout the balance of 2019, the company will continue to supply products our three previously awarded energy projects, five additional projects or the pending regulatory approvals or awaiting contractor and\/or supplier selection and are expected to begin in earnest in 2019 and continue for several years thereafter.","Martin Marietta is well positioned to provide the aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete needs for these multi-year projects. The non-residential market represented 37%, our first quarter heritage aggregate shipments. Heritage aggregates shipments to the residential market increased 8% driven by weather deferred home building activity in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Despite the recent slowdown in housing unit starts at the national level. The residential outlook across Martin Marietta\u2019s geographic footprint remains positive, driven by favorable demographics, job growth, land availability, steady interest rates, and deficient permitting.","Currently housing unit permit growth for our top 10 states is outpacing the national average for all three residential categories, total multifamily and single family. In our view, the issuance of these permits represents the best indicator of future housing construction activity. The residential market accounted for 23% of first quarter heritage aggregate shipments. To conclude our discussion on end-use markets, the ChemRock\/Rail market accounted for the remaining 7% of first quarter heritage aggregate shipments. Volume to this sector increased 9% reflecting lower balanced and agricultural lime shipments.","Heritage aggregates pricing improved 4% following the implementation of annual price increases throughout the majority of our geographic footprint. We were able to achieve the solid growth despite unfavorable product mix from increased shipments of lower price base stone, which reduced first quarter heritage average selling price by $0.29 per ton or 210 basis points.","Keep in mind, an increase in base stone shipments is only unfavorable from an average selling price optics viewpoint. In fact, given the base stone is typically the initial material needed for early stage construction activity and higher price clean stone shipping subsequently follow, we\u2019re encouraged by this trend.","Drilling down to geographical trends, we achieved heritage pricing growth of 3% for the Mid-America group. This was accomplished through continued price discipline offset by product mix from base shipments, price discipline about to 6% heritage pricing growth for the Southeast Group. product and geographic mix, particularly from weather impacted Colorado shipments, limited West Group price and growth to 3%.","acquired operations shipped 3.5 million tons. It\u2019s selling prices approximately 15% below the corporate average. As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter results for the legacy Bluegrass operations will be classified as heritage for reporting purposes.","Cement shipments improved 7% driven by the strength of the Texas market, increased shipments of oil well products, and the addition of our new Caney sales yard in Houston. first quarter cement pricing benefited from favorable product and geographic mix, increasing 4%. Annual price increases went into effect on April 1st with widespread support in both north and South Texas. We believe our cement operations will continue to benefit from a tight supply environment in Texas as forecasted demand is expected to exceed domestic production capacity by 10% in 2019.","Turning to our downstream businesses, ready mix concrete shipments decreased 4% as Colorado\u2019s harsh winter hindered early construction activity in that state. First quarter pricing improved modestly for the ready mix business in total led by a 3% increase in Colorado. As a reminder, the majority of annual price increases became effective on April 1st in both Colorado and Texas.","Our Colorado asphalt and paving business lost production days from extreme winter weather including freezing ground temperatures resulting in reduced asphalt shipments. First quarter asphalt pricing in Colorado improved 4%. Importantly, bidding activity and customer confidence remained strong and we are highly confident in the strength of the Colorado market.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss specifics of our first quarter financial results. Jim?","Jim Nickolas","Thank you, Ward. The building materials business achieved record first quarter products and services revenues of $809 million, an 18% increase. And gross profit improved 39% to $118 million. Aggregates product gross margin expanded to 550 basis points to 18% steadier and higher shipment and production levels provided improved operating leverage, which, in conjunction with higher prices, drove the majority of the margin improvement.","as Ward highlighted, our cement operations benefited from strong volume and pricing growth. However, despite this top-line improvement, extended maintenance outages, higher rail freight costs and reduced operating leverage from lower production levels led to 1,270 basis point degradation in product gross margin. outages included planned and unplanned repairs at both cement plants and the acceleration of maintenance activities originally planned for later in the year.","With over half of our 2019 planned maintenance completed, we are returning to normal production capacity at all kilns and are well positioned to benefit from the growing demand and the robust bidding pipeline throughout the remainder of the year. In late 2018, we initiated a restructuring of our southwest ready mix concrete business and are pleased with the initial results. These efforts contributed to the 100 basis point improvement in that business\u2019s quarterly product gross margin despite relatively flat shipments and pricing.","Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from strong domestic steel production and increased global domain for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $69 million, a new quarterly record. Additionally, the business achieved record first quarter product gross profit of $27 million. Product gross margins held steady at an attractive 38.5%. thanks to price improvements and production efficiencies that helped offset increased sales lower margin products in higher costs for supplies and contract services.","Our consolidated results included the benefit of two non-recurring items. First, we reversed a $4 million purchase accounting accrual related to the TXI acquisition, which is recorded in other operating income net as an increased earnings from operations. Second, we recorded a discreet income tax benefit of $13 million, may change in the tax status of the subsidiary from a pass-through entity to seek operation, which reduced tax expense for the quarter. Neither of these items should be extrapolated in a run rate calculation. Excluding the first quarter tax benefit and other discrete events. We expect our estimated tax rate for full year 2019 to range from 20% to 22%.","And we\u2019ll go to the rest of the year. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with the continued focus on creating shareholder value through value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the opportunistic deployment of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases, all while returning to our target leverage ratio. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $350 million to $400 million for the full year as we invest in high return projects focused on increasing efficiency to drive margin expansion.","Since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015, we returned more than $1.4 billion to shareholders through conurbation of share repurchases as well as meaningful and sustainable dividends that were increased 9% in last August. The trailing 12 months ended March 2019, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in our applicable credit agreement with 2.7 times. While this remains modestly above the top end of our target leverage ratio, we expect to continue deleveraging and return to our target leverage ratio of two to 2.5 times by year end.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to ward.","Ward Nye","Jim, thanks. to conclude we remain highly confident in our output for the balance of 2019 and as outlined in today\u2019s release have reaffirmed our full-year guidance. Remember our outlook contemplates an improvement in weather conditions from the extreme conditions we experienced in our regions in 2018 but nonetheless (17:24) wetter than historic norms. While we were pleased with our first quarter performance and are confident in our outlook for the rest of the year, we believe it\u2019s premature to raise full year guidance based solely on these results.","As we\u2019ve often noted, the first quarter results are typically disproportionately driven by construction activity during the last two weeks of March. We will consider whether it\u2019s appropriate to revisit our outlook later in the year. We believe attractive population and employment trends combined with positive momentum from state departments of transportation and continued private sector gains will support sustainable construction growth in our key regions for the rest of the year and for future periods as well.","In 2019, we anticipate the growth in our top 10 states to outpace the nation as a whole and contribute to positive volume and pricing trends across all of our product lines underpinning our confidence that our company is on its way to posting another record year.","As Martin Marietta celebrates 25 years as a public company this year, we\u2019ll continue with the approach that it\u2019s proven to be successful. Our focus on price, discipline, strategic geographic positioning and prudent capital allocation and underscored by our commitment to safety. That\u2019s why we remain confident about Martin Marietta\u2019s ability to achieve continued profitability growth and create value for our shareholders.","If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from the line of Catherine Thompson from Thomson Research Group. Your line is open.","Catherine Thompson","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. The first question is on ASPs. A two-part question, first, could you confirm that there was not as great as an inventory build in Q1 2019 versus last year, because that certainly does seem to be the feedback from the field from the industry in general. And then the second follow-up with that, could you give more quantification of that commentary that you haven\u2019t prepared comments about a greater mix of base stone, how \u2013 to what degree, did that impact? Q1, percentage of basis points, what does it mean for visibility going forward for volumes and what does it mean for mix going forward?","Ward Nye ","Good morning, Catherine. This is ward. Thanks for your question. A couple of things, one, yes, we did have actually inventory draw down in the first quarter of this year. So, we did not have to build that you saw last year. So that\u2019s the first part of your question. I think the other part of your questions are really good one, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m happy to try to address, because I think this is an important notion for us to really hit very clearly. If we\u2019re looking at the first quarter of 2018 relative to products that went out, here\u2019s the way I would encourage you to think about it.","About 25% of our product last year was base stone, somewhere between 28% and 29% of it this year was base stone. Last year, almost 52.5% of it was clean stone this year is 50%. here\u2019s my point, Catherine. If you\u2019re seeing more base stone glad today, that\u2019s newer projects that are beginning from the ground up and are likely to last a longer period of time.","At some point, you\u2019re going to put asphalt or concrete on top of base stone. So, we\u2019re going to get those clean stone sales as they come through. Greater base stone sales in my view is longer-term nice projects that pretend well for the balance of 2019 and really, I think start to tell a good story for 2020, but here\u2019s what\u2019s important to it as we go through that. if we take a look at what our ASP on our heritage business would have been this quarter, if we had had the same mix that we had last quarter, our ASP for heritage would have improved 6.1%. So that\u2019s the 210 basis point improvement and we think seeing more base stone is attractive. We think that type of pricing growth, our heritage business is also attractive. And I do think I responded to your question relative to the inventories as well.","Catherine Thompson","Yes. A follow-up on the cement. Just a clarification, could you quantify how perhaps a dollar impacts this quarter versus a typical Q1 or perhaps last year in terms of how higher maintenance cost was? And then you said there were some planned and the unplanned, maybe just a little bit more clarification on planned versus unplanned maintenance.","Ward Nye","Well, let\u2019s do it this way. I\u2019ll ask Jim to help double team on this. Let me start the conversation in this regard. As we came into the year, Catherine, what I would say as we anticipated having about $19.2 million worth of expense relative to the kilns during the course of the year. What we\u2019ve done in the first quarter is we spent or invested a $11.2 million of that. So, if you look at what that looks like over a period of years, that\u2019s clearly accelerating a lot of that into the first quarter and our thought process is several for, but primarily driven by the notion that we want to be in an attractive place to run the business very aggressively as we go into the pure summer months in that Texas market. I\u2019ll ask Jim to speak very specifically to some of the dollars around the maintenance inventory and some other issues that do affect the financials.","Jim Nickolas","Good Morning, Catherine. The breakout between the maintenance expense was about $10 million more this quarter versus Q1 of 2018. That $10 million higher expense, $6 million of that was planned about a little under $4 million that was unplanned.","Catherine Thompson","Okay, perfect.","Jim Nickolas","So that\u2019s about 10 percentage points on the gross margin side. The other items that impact the cement, let me just run out the whole cement gross margin for clarity. We did have, because we sold, we had good sales growth, the shipments, the production was lower, given the downtime. We had to dip into our inventory in a deeper way, which resulted in a $6 million headwind for the quarter again, versus prior year. Those are the two biggest impacts, maintenance and inventory draw down. The third item was increased rate was about $2 million as we had to supply two new distribution outlets. So, there\u2019s about $2 million of extra expense. Those are the three biggest items that impacted the gross margin for the cement business.","Ward Nye","And Catherine, what I would add onto that is obviously, the increased transportation is moving primarily into new Caney and Houston and moving out west to Odessa. So, those are some additional charges that we actually view is very welcome.","Catherine Thompson","Okay. And final just quick cleanup question on guidance and changed, I appreciate that Q1 seasonally is a smaller contributor. We know that on average for the industry from the checks we\u2019ve done maybe, 20% of your volumes, but could you remind us, perhaps on a historical basis how much of earnings typically hit in Q1? And I guess the one thing that I\u2019m noticing; I just wanted to make sure that we\u2019re right on the seat. It looks like, at the first time, a big difference this year versus last year, having all three end market res, non-res and public growing. Could you just for our sake, just ensure that there\u2019s no change on conviction even though the numbers haven\u2019t changed, but is there any change in the conviction for the year? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Catherine, thank you again. Look, we feel very good about the year and we feel very good about the start. As we said in the prepared remarks and we don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s the right moment to come back and revisit guidance at all yet. And to your point, if we look at a five-year average, here\u2019s what I would tell you, five-year average, which showed 19% of shipments occur in the first quarter, 19% of revenues in the first quarter, to your point, very specifically Catherine, 12% of gross profit and around 12% of EBITDA.","So again, I think we\u2019re sitting in a very attractive place. Everything that we see and everything that we hear from customers for the year looks wonderful at this moment and you\u2019re certainly not hearing anything that tends to be a lack of conviction from us on the full year.","Catherine Thompson","Thank you very much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Catherine.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is open.","Trey Grooms","Thank you. Good morning. So, the first question, I have is on aggregates incrementals, you guys saw an improvement and I think by my math, were about \u2013 the incrementals were about 38%, 39% and I know it\u2019s difficult to look at incremental margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but you guys are, I believe looking for full year to be around the 60% range. So, can you talk about some of the factors impacting 1Q that maybe won\u2019t be an issue in future quarters or how to think about the bridge and incrementals margins for aggregates, going to get into that 60% range to the year?","Ward Nye","Good morning, Trey. Thanks for your questions. A couple of things, I do think it\u2019s important to hit just what you said and that is remember, that\u2019s 60% on average in the aggregates business. So, I want to make sure that we\u2019re talking about that. Obviously, Q1 is a little bit different, because you don\u2019t have significant portions of the aggregates business that are really running the way that we expect them two-fold full year. So, that is a caveat. let me turn it over to Jim to walk you through some of the math on where it looks like for the quarter and how we think that shakes out for the year.","Jim Nickolas","Yes. good morning, Trey. Two things that I\u2019d like to point out, one, the headline number is in fact 30% incrementals, but what that\u2019s missing is the fact that we didn\u2019t have Bluegrass in Q1 of 2018. if you were to do a pro forma calculation, including bluegrass, the incrementals would go to 51%. So, about a 13% improvement, just that simple math change. in addition, we increased the tons we ship predominantly the rail in this quarter by 17% and that led to higher freight cost for the quarter, which would account for another 13% incremental points to getting us to close to 64% just taking those two items into account.","Trey Grooms","Gotcha. Okay. And that\u2019s still the case; just kind of looking on a full-year basis is for the overall business to get back to that kind of 60% range, that\u2019s the outlook for\u2026","Jim Nickolas","That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what we\u2019re still expecting.","Ward Nye","The overall aggregate business is correct, right.","Trey Grooms","yes, yes, for aggregates. Thank you. And then secondly on the infrastructure side, up 2% I think, which it kind of lags some of the other end markets. And I think you\u2019re looking for infrastructure now to be up kind of high single digits. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing there on that end market and how we should see that progress as we go through the year with that kind of coming out of the gate a little slower?","Ward Nye","Yes. I guess what I would say Trey, in many respects, if you think about the way DOT specifications work, there is not going to be a lot of asphalt paving in particular in most jurisdictions until after you get about March 15. So again, if we\u2019re looking at the rhythm and cadence of the way that the years building, we\u2019re not at all surprised by for infrastructure sets here at the end of the first quarter. I think if we go back to that commentary I gave you early on about seeing more base stone, I think that\u2019s the type of work you\u2019re going to see being driven toward infrastructure this year. And one I would say too is simply looking at the states that matter most to us, I mean Texas is looking at $8.2 billion worth of letting the share. that\u2019s a very big job, very big number and we\u2019re seeing a number of very attractive design build jobs in that state.","If we look at Colorado that did not have a particularly great year, last year. 2019 looks a lot better. They\u2019re looking at $2.2 billion DOT budget versus $1.6 billion last year and the state even more recently has transferred $650 million of FY2018 general fund surplus to transportation over the next couple of years. If you look at NCDOT here in our backyard, full year 2019 letting estimate $2.8 billion to $3 billion, and again, these are very \u2013 that was the big numbers. That\u2019s a 35% increase over what we saw last year. And if we\u2019re looking at Georgia, they\u2019re looking at lettings of about $1.9 billion, that\u2019s 2x of what we were seeing back in 2014. And if we\u2019re looking at what they\u2019re looking for in 2020, they\u2019ve requested $2.1 billion in 2020, so that\u2019s a 10% increase.","So I think back to your point, I think seasonality is what has affected infrastructure as we\u2019ve come out of the gate. We fully expected it though the letting activity that we\u2019re seeing from the states is very good. And the backlogs that we\u2019re hearing from our contractor clients are often at record levels. So, again, I think we\u2019ve got enormous conviction and confidence around where infrastructure is going this year.","Trey Grooms","Right. That\u2019s encouraging. And then if you look at, I guess last one from me was you\u2019ve made a comment word about April 1st pricing in cement. Can you remind us how much you guys went out with, and I think you mentioned lots of res support in North and Central Texas, just any other granularity around that. And I know you don\u2019t do a lot in Houston market, but just any other color on what you might be seeing in the Houston market particularly?","Ward Nye","Now, happy to try to help with that. I mean, number one, same pricing up in Q1 is just nice to see period, because to your point, the price increases for us in that marketplace really don\u2019t go on back to April 1, and by the way, same answer on ready mix concrete. So we\u2019re talking about right now, North Texas is somewhere in that $6 to $8 per ton and South Texas $4 to $5 and that Houston and Central Texas popping in that $5 range, Trey. So again, it gives you a good steady snapshot of what it looks like. And again, it\u2019s fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the last years. Pricing tends to be a little bit better in North Texas, a little bit weaker by the time you get to the Gulf for reasons that you understand.","Trey Grooms","Got it. All right. Thanks for all the color and congrats on the nice quarter.","Ward Nye","Trey, thanks so much. Have a great day.","Trey Grooms","Thank you. You too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Scott Schrier from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Scott Schrier","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Obviously, non-res was a pleasant surprise in the quarter, you had a significant year-on-year growth and understanding that it is a small quarter. but I\u2019m curious if you could talk a little bit about, first, was there any impact from the Houston chemical plant incident. And second, was this non-res performance in line with your expectations or did outperform and was there some pull forward? Just want to get a sense for what the bidding process looks and the cadence of the non-res, which you know seems to be a pretty good surprise in the quarter.","Ward Nye","Yes. Several things that I\u2019d say Scott, now the Houston situation was not particularly a driver for that. If we come back and take a look at really what we were seeing in states that matter the most to us, non-res for us in North Carolina is up nicely, non-res for us in Georgia is up very, very nicely. So, I think that\u2019s a lot of it. If we go and look at the nature of some of the non-res, it\u2019s got a nice enduring quality to it. You\u2019ve heard us speak over the last several years about warehouse and you\u2019ve heard us speak about data centers. You\u2019ve heard us speak increasingly about wind farms, that that level of activity continues to be really quite strong in our footprint.","So, I think a lot of what you\u2019re seeing on non-res, number one, it\u2019s not a surprise to us, and number two is, really driven by some states that population trends and employment trends have been very strong over the last several years. But volume trends haven\u2019t been as strong. And I think part of what we\u2019ve been waiting for, and I think much of what the investor base has been waiting for is to see states like North Carolina and Georgia really start to before.","So, remember one of the things that we\u2019ve long talked about is the importance of that bottom right hand corner of the United States map to our business. And as we look at what one of the big differentiators were \u2013 has been in non-res for the quarter that was a piece of it. The other thing that I would tell you and it\u2019s not so much a mover for the quarter, I think it\u2019s going to be a mover for the year as you\u2019re looking non-res will be what\u2019s happening with those large energy projects in the Gulf.","As you recall, we\u2019ve been talking about a dozen-ish of those large jobs that are either in action or we believe coming into action in the not-too-distant future. Today, we\u2019ve got two different jobs with Exxon and, and one at Cheniere LNG Train 3 in that marketplace. And we think more coming during the course of the year. But back to your point, Scott, those were the primary drivers that we\u2019re seeing in non-res.","Scott Schrier","Got it. Great. And then I wanted to ask another one on cement and cement pricing and your comments suggested that you have some confidence in any environment, but I just want to ask a little bit about that confidence and especially near Houston, where you\u2019ve had imports as a rescue, some of the global cement trade happenings that could influence multinationals willingness and the ability to import. We see the emergence of some independent cement terminals coming online in Texas. So, I\u2019m wondering how all that plays into the environment for pricing in Texas. Given that of course, we know there\u2019s that supply and demand imbalance, but just want to see if that throws a wrench in the mix a little bit.","Ward Nye","Yes. I guess my comments would be two-fold. I think you finished with something that I think some important point and that is you do have supply demand imbalance there. You\u2019ve got more demand than you have supply number one. Number two, in many respects with the exception really in one notable case, the people, who were importing are also domestic producers in that marketplace. And if you come back and reflect on it while Texas is in fact the only state in which we have cement, our cement operations strategy number one in Dallas, and number two in San Antonio. So, if we look at the large cities in Texas, our drivers are really going to be DFW, it\u2019s going to be San Antonio and then two degrees South Texas and Houston.","So, I would say the supply demand imbalance is very healthy for where we are. I think the pricing environment is more attractive. I think the fact that really, you\u2019ve only got one non-domestic producer, who is coming in at any moment keeps things in a very steady state even in that part of the state right now. So again, if we\u2019re looking at how we view Texas cement this year, we have a very robust view of how that business is going to perform.","Scott Schrier","Great. Thanks for that, Ward and good luck.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our question or comment comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nishu Sood","Thank you. I wanted to follow up first on the aggregates pricing. On a mix adjusted basis, the 1Q pricing was up around 6% year-over-year. So, above the 3% to 5% that you\u2019re expecting for the year, are we already seeing some of the pricing tailwind benefit from the strong start to the year? How would that \u2013 how do you, would you expect that to carry forward as we go into the heart of that construction season?","Ward Nye","Nishu, I would say maybe modestly, you\u2019re seeing some of that, what I would say is really, if you think about the work that\u2019s going early in the year, most of its going to be work that was put into back clock last year. So to the extent that things could be tighter in some markets before the end of the year is over, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily seeing that benefit just yet. Again, I think the mix effect does mass quite as the overall strength of the aggregates. I also think that in the fullness of time, particularly in some of the eastern markets, you\u2019re likely to see a bit more tailwind on that. But again, if we\u2019re coming back and saying, how do we see pricing right now, did we feel confident within the guidance that we put out? Yes, we do, and do we feel even better about the mixed that we\u2019re seeing go out. I feel unquestionably better about that and mixed the more base from my perspective the better.","Nishu Sood","Got it. Great. And the second question, as you were discussing the improvement in performance relative to last year, one of the topics, which you brought up again in terms of 2018 was the issue of contractor labor constraints. As we think about this year so far, it\u2019s still early in the construction season, but is your \u2013 is your 1Q and the momentum coming out of the quarter evidence that some of those contractor labor constraints have begun to ease or is it really more the weather, the early start to the construction season that you described in some parts of the country?","Ward Nye","Nishu, I think it\u2019s probably all of the above. Clearly, the weather was better. I think backlogs for customers, who are better. But if we look at construction employment to recruit 3.4% in March of 2019 versus the prior year, and it\u2019s well above the national rate and building on a 4.3% growth last year and 3.4% growth in 2017. So, we\u2019re simply looking at the sheer number of people who are now coming to work or coming back to work in construction. It\u2019s growing. So, I think number one, that\u2019s gotten better. Number two, weather was better.","I think the other issue is we\u2019re going to have better logistics this year with both truck and rail. So, I think a number of the bottlenecks that we saw last year, are they going to be 100% gone this year? I\u2019m not \u2013 certainly not going to bet on that. Are we seeing labor better right now for contractors and we saw a year ago, absolutely we are, which is why I\u2019ve come back and answered your question. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one thing with the other. I think it\u2019s a confluence of factors that are actually working the way that we thought that they would.","Nishu Sood","Great. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Nishu.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Hey guys, heritage pricing in aggregates and cement were very strong at the start the year and as you kind of flag a lot of the increases you guys have in place for spring, next don\u2019t kick in until April. So, I guess based on what you realize thus far and as that kind of flow through and trickle through over the course of the year. It seems like there\u2019s potentially some upside to the 3% to 5% of pricing that you've guided. Any color on that front would be helpful. And is there an opportunity, I guess, if things are really tight and strong, maybe certain market you guys go for a second round back half of the year?","Ward Nye","Yes. It will be interesting, Phil. Again, I think we're just, at this stage, just sticking with the 3% to 5% on price. I do think there can be some places this year, depending on how weather cooperates, otherwise it might get tight. Could I actually see some tightness in parts of Eastern North Carolina? I think that's possible. Is it possible that you could see some tightness in some portions of Colorado? I think that's possible. Yes, possible, but you might see some tightness in some parts of the Midwest, and I think that could be. So I think we'll simply have to watch that. As a general rule, we don't talk much about the notion of midyears until we get closer to midyears. We discussed last year the fact that the contractors prefer to go ahead and see whatever the price is going to be early in the year and have some sense that that's what it's going to be throughout the course of the year. I think that is typically what you're going to see, but I do think tightness can make some individual projects bid differently as we get deeper into the year.","Phil Ng","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And Ward, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how transportation activity in some of your key states like North Carolina, Georgia and Florida were starting like to pick up both from the letting standpoint. Just from a timing perspective, I just want to get a better appreciation, do you start seeing some of that flow through this year? Or is it kind of more of a 2020 event? And based on the backlogs you had coming into the year and how it's shaping up for 2020, do you stack things up from a growth standpoint? Do you think things accelerate even more in 2020 or kind of pretty steady 2019 versus 2020?","Ward Nye","I think you\u2019re going to see a good pickup in 2019. And part of what I'm taken by right now, Phil, and I haven't heard this as much in years past as I've heard this year, I've heard several contractors telling me early in this quarter \u2013 by this quarter, I mean Q1 in this instance \u2013 that they were already building work into 2020. So I think in many respects, the infrastructure that is there, that has been bid, that we know is coming, is, in many respects, baked for 2019. I think what you're looking at is, particularly on the public side, a level of bidding and letting activity that I think, at this point, starts building into a very steady 2020 as well. I think your commentary on that is entirely correct.","Phil Ng","Okay. Thanks a lot. good luck in the quarter.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good morning everyone.","Ward Nye","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","What I\u2019m wondering if you can just expand on your pricing comments. So like-for-like, pricing is up 6% this quarter, and I'm just trying to square that up with the comments that \u2013 on the full year guide and the discussion you just had a moment ago. I guess it sounds like from a \u2013 just a spot market basis alone, there should be upwards pressure to the guidance. So I'm just wondering, is it \u2013 just back to your volume comment earlier on the call, is it too early in the year to revisit the pricing outlook? Or are we expecting the mix headwind to go from 200 to 300 basis points? I guess I'm trying to square that up. Is it just a function of it's early to the year, and let's just see how next quarter develops versus now the pricing is set, we have large work coming that's preset prices? Can you just help me square that up?","Ward Nye","No, I can\u2019t. And Jerry, I think you nailed it there in the middle. It's just too early in the year right now. We don't say anything that makes us lose our conviction on pricing. Pricing this year from our vantage point looks more attractive than pricing did last year. I don't see anything that's going to materially change that. I think your point is entirely on target, and that is it's the first three months of the year. And important markets like Colorado didn't even wake up because it's how I like to tell people they had a wonderful ski season and a really bad construction season this year. So we're going to wait and see what this looks like, where the entire business across our enterprise is really going. And the odd thing is, Jerry, that truly doesn't happen usually until the 1st of May because if you think about it, some of the Midwest is still simply coming out of a flooding circumstance as well. So, it's certainly not due to any lack of conviction, we're just not going to get in over our skis after just three months into the year.","Jerry Revich","Okay, understood. And then in terms of the results from a non-res standpoint, really strong in the quarter. Is that just an easy weather comp in a certain area? Or did you win one of the major infrastructure projects in terms of LNG and chemicals? Or how much was that in the mix? And your comment earlier, just a clarification on the infrastructure piece. So when exactly do you expect, based on shipment timing, to see an acceleration from the low single-digit range that we saw in the first quarter towards the \u2013 a high single-digit run rate that you expect the balance of the year?","Ward Nye","Yes. With respect to your first question with respect to non-res, it was really more driven by just broad, solid non-res activity across the enterprise. But as I indicated earlier on, you did see a couple of states that are seeing particularly strong non-res gains. And again, that's North Carolina and Georgia. So when we're seeing that, that does help us pretty considerably. To the second part of your question, no, there was not any particular big project in the Gulf or otherwise that served to skew that or make it more look attractive. I just think we're sitting in a place that non-res for us is likely to be pretty attractive this year, and it came out of the box in a good, strong way. And I do think there has been some pent-up demand there, but I think there are also good backlogs that continue to be \u2013 being built by our contractor base right now, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is open.","Stanley Elliott","Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. A quick question on CapEx expectations. You've been spending above depreciation probably like four, five years now. How long should we think that, that continues? What do we think about kind of moderating that back? First part. And then second part, maybe speak to some of the cost savings programs that you all have underway, I think, which is probably due to some of the CapEx that you've been running at a higher level.","Ward Nye","Stanley, good morning. Thanks for your question. A couple of things. You\u2019re entirely right. If we look over the last several years, we have been spending CapEx at above DD&A levels. And oftentimes, we'll refer you to DD&A levels, because that's not a bad number for you to keep in mind on what a stay-in-business CapEx number would look like. What I think you'll see is if you look at the range that we set for CapEx this year, it's actually getting closer to our DD&A levels. So you've actually seen that very naturally and gradually. And I would submit to you down simply because we spend some money in some very careful ways, and the organization in many respects is as well capitalized today as it's ever been. What I'll do is turn it over to Jim to talk to you a little bit more about some of the specifics in the CapEx program, but I wanted to make sure, to your point, that we're level-set relative to history, the fact that we're below DD&A during the downturn, about now getting closer to DD&A.","Jim Nickolas","Yes. As Ward mentioned, our DD&A is converged with our CapEx spending by and large five years ago. that wasn't the case we\u2019re coming out of the recession, have to make up some loss ground. We've done that by and large, and if you look over time, our CapEx as a percent of revenues has ranged from 8% to 10% and we've been trending lower. So, last couple years, closer to 8% and we expect it to stay right around that spot. So we feel pretty good about that.","Some of the specific projects, we've got \u2013 we've got some large mines that were moving underground has been ongoing. Those should be wrapping up in the next year or two. But we also want to keep some powder dry for opportunistic commercial activities that we have a chance to partner with a contractor in unique ways, we want to keep some dry powder for that. And we've been deploying and we'll be deploying some money on special projects that a) provide outsized returns, and b) help us ensure ongoing business with that contractor.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect. Jim in your comments, you had mentioned M&A, I mean does that still seem to be kind of kind of a high pick item for the company right now or with that just kind of messaging more that you\u2019re consistent with kind of the capital redeployment strategy that you've had in the past?","Jim Nickolas","Stanley, I think if you go back and look at the capital allocation priorities, the right transaction continues to be at the top of the list for us. So, for example, when we look at the way bluegrass is performing for us, hitting the EBITDA margins that we thought we would see we're seeing synergies nicely in advance of the $15 million that we had indicated at marketplace that we'd be getting. That's my long way of saying. the right transaction continues to be the number one capital priority for us, investing in the business is pretty close behind that and making sure that we have it well done and then returning cash to shareholders, there were meaningful and a sustainable dividend and the share buyback. So, those have been staples to our dialogue over the last several years and they continue to be in that order.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect. Thank you very much and congrats on the strong start for the year.","Jim Nickolas","Thanks so much Stanley.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois","[Indiscernible]","Ward Nye","Garik, I heard something, but I didn't hear your full question.","Garik Shmois","Sorry. Can you hear me now?","Ward Nye","Yes, I can. Thanks. Good to hear your voice.","Garik Shmois","Yes. So, I want to ask you some volumes in non-res in particular, how much of the volume do you think might have been pulled forward into the quarter? And just given the favorable weather and do you characterize any risk that I have a vacuum in demand in the second half of the year just given the earlier start to the season?","Ward Nye","I'm going to ask my partner in crime, Jim Nickolas to respond to, then I\u2019ll circle back to you Garik.","Jim Nickolas","Yes. I think it\u2019s actually the reverse of being pulled forward, it\u2019s a bit more of a carryover from Q4 that there's been a slowdown in from weather impacted delays. So, I think if there's any weather movement, it\u2019s benefitting from the Q4 we had, I don't think it's as much a pull for from Q2 or Q3.","Ward Nye","and Garik, I guess what I would say too is I think it's possible that you might start seeing some tonnage going to those large energy projects this year that we do not have specifically committed right now. So, I think if I'm looking at non-res across our enterprise at echo, but Jim said, but at the same time I don't see something relative to activity or inactivity there that causes me any degree of concern or pause as we\u2019re looking at, I think non-res is going to be a very strong segment from Martin Marietta this year.","Garik Shmois","Okay. And then, my follow-up question is just on inventories. You talked about the draw down in Q1, I was wondering if there's any way to quantify that in aggregates and then as you rebuild inventories over the remainder of the year, how should that impact incremental margin? Should we perhaps [indiscernible].","Ward Nye","You\u2019re breaking up there, but I think I got the gist of your question, okay. So, we did draw down inventories to some degree this quarter and with a mild headwind, but as we build inventory in the remainder of the year, that should act as a tailwind for us. So that should be helpful.","Garik Shmois","Okay. thank you. Okay,","Ward Nye","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Timna Tanners ","Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone.","Ward Nye","Good morning, Timna.","Timna Tanners ","I want to ask, I know you mentioned that your Cassie's party was debt pay down, but you did buy back shares in the second half of last year. And I just \u2013 when I, if you can remind us how you think about the timing decisions for $5.","Ward Nye","Yes. So, we're focusing remaining investment grade and deleveraging as we stayed in when we bought bluegrass. But of course, we resumed the share buyback in the last year. And we're still \u2013 we're still on that path Q1 seasonally low or light quarter for us from a cash flow perspective. So we held off, but we expect to resume in the rest of the year by deploying some of our cash per share repurchases.","Ward Nye","We try not to look at it just in a strictly rigid way either. We want to be realistic and if we can want it to be opportunistic with it. So we try to look at it in a very clear-eye fashion.","Timna Tanners ","Okay. And then just wondering if you have any of your \u2013 if you could update us on your latest thoughts are, what's your sources in Washington saying about funding sources for the next highway spending program. I know it's a little bit early but was just starting to, we've been seeing more headlines about the two sides of the aisle perhaps coming together, different funding sources, whether it be gas tax increase or actually per vehicle kind of monitoring sources. So it just wondering if you have any updated thoughts on how that's going play out?","Ward Nye","Well, I guess I know what you know and that is, I believe the President and Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, I think we're supposed to meet today to discuss infrastructure. I think there's several things to watch. I think between now and clearly August is going to be an important time. Clearly you've got the U.S. Chamber and others who were very focused on a near-term gas tax increase. And I think that's the important phraseology to put to it near term, because the simple fact is the United States is going to have to in the fullness of time move away from a gas tax and come up with other mechanisms.","I think those mechanisms include vehicle mileage tax on trucking. I think it can include electric battery taxes. I think it can include to a degree an indexed gas tax. I think the table was fairly open on stuff those can be and I think what's going to be fascinating is to see how interested the Republicans and the Democrats are two actually work together on this. It is the one area that we believe there is bipartisan agreement. I think if they're going to get there, they need to get there sooner rather than later because once we get into election season it gets increasingly challenged.","Timna Tanners","I know the tough question asking you about politics, so I appreciate your thoughts on it. Thanks again.","Ward Nye","You\u2019re welcome, Timma.","Operator","Thank. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Rohit Seth","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just \u2013 what are the hot topics this quarter has been on the Mississippi River flooding and I know you guys have some exposure to Iowa, Nebraska and some of the neighboring states and your ChemRock\/Rail volumes were a little bit weak. Just maybe you could speak on that and just gives a status of what\u2019s going on over there.","Ward Nye","Yes, I guess, what I would say. You\u2019re right, there has been some flooding as you recall, we\u2019re not up and down really that Mississippi River market anymore, but we do have some flooding that has hit sit our businesses in the Midwest. Now when I say that, we haven\u2019t suffered in our quarries with flooding, but local communities have certainly suffered from it. And point, I\u2019ll tell you too is there is tonnage that\u2019s required to come behind these storms. If we\u2019re looking that our current backlog or customer backlog in the Midwest specifically, it\u2019s 59% over where it was in the prior year. And that\u2019s a pretty big number. And a good bit of that has been some shot rock that has been required already to be used to help remedy some of the flooding and shot rock that we think will continue to be required over the next several months to do that as well.","So at least last year when Hurricane Florence came through, we had flooded sits in the Midwest. We do not flooded bits, I\u2019m going to be really clear on that point. But I do think from a business perspective it would generate some activity. It certainly creates individual pain and loss for families and our hearts and prayers and money and resource going out to them in many instances. But I do think that\u2019s where we sit relative to a business snapshot on that issue, Rohit.","Rohit Seth","Gotcha. Okay. And then on variable costs on diesel and asphalt, maybe give us a sense of your outlook on those who are here?","Ward Nye","Yes, I mean, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say. If we look at really where diesel was first quarter, expense was relatively flat on a 7.4% reduction in pro gallon pricing. Now the difference was we also had 7.8% increase in usage simply due to Bluegrass. So we\u2019re just kind of have to seek where that goes for the rest of the year. We are not hedged on diesel. The primary hedge we have on that, as you recall over years has been relative to what we contend to do with respect to average selling price. But at least as we look diesel in the first quarter, relatively well behaved.","As reminder, last year for the full year we used a little bit over 47 million gallons of diesel fuel and that was not having Bluegrass with us in the first quarter. Obviously liquid asphalt is up for the year. We think that actually probably works relatively well do asphalt pricing. And we\u2019ve seen relatively flat natural gas pricing and that can matter to us, particularly relative to costs with respect to our magnesia specialties business. So again, we\u2019re, we\u2019re looking at an overall input cost situation that we don\u2019t think is unattractive at all.","Rohit Seth","Gotcha. Okay. And then final question on, we talked about the base stone potentially impacting the mix, but you had really good heritage pricing in the quarter. Is the guidance inclusive of that mix headwind? So all in, good underlying pricing but potentially some mix of base stone?","Ward Nye","Yes. We do our best to look at the mix and see where we think it\u2019s going to be. We felt like because of the increased infrastructure that there would be more based activity this year. I think we probably saw a little bit more base activity earlier than we thought we would have. So we have done our best to apply in many respects. What I hate to say is some art to that. So that\u2019s where we are obviously by the time we get to have here, we\u2019re going to have much better feel for it. But I think you get a sense of what the puts and takes are right now.","Rohit Seth","But then the base stone is not a margin headwind, it\u2019s just a optics thing, right?","Ward Nye","It is absolutely, positively an optics thing. That\u2019s entirely correct.","Rohit Seth","All right. Thank you very much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Rohit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Adrian Huerta from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Adrian Huerta","Thank you for taking my call and congrats on the results. Two questions if I may. One on M&A. If you\u2019re starting to see valuations getting more expensive for \u2013 to acquire aggregate quarries. And my second question has to do with the Bluegrass prices, that they\u2019re really \u2013 they \u2013 where already 15% below your prices and they seem to be at the same level. Do you see the opportunities for the coming quarters for that gap to close? Thanks.","Ward Nye","Adrian, good morning and welcome to the call and welcome to covering our company. We\u2019re delighted to have you. And just a couple of things. M&A what I would say, it\u2019s a completely depends. It depends on sellers\u2019 expectations, it depends on what we think can be done with the business. Do I think sellers\u2019 expectations have gone up as the industry has very modest recover over the last several years they have. But at the same time in the right markets are we able to find M&A transactions that can be incredibly value creating for our shareholders? The answer is yes. Does it mean that you\u2019re going to have to be a bit more selective on some of those? I think the answer to that is, yes as well. We\u2019ve tried to be really disciplined in what we look at, and we try to be really disciplined in our due diligence process if it makes sense, we tend to move on it. I think if you go back and look at our history on transactions that we\u2019ve done, they\u2019ve tended to work very well. Now, what you don\u2019t see are the transactions that we\u2019ve walked away from. So are they more expensive today? Yes, they probably are. Is the good value there to be found? Yes, they are.","Your other questions, so perfectly fair one is with respect to Bluegrass and how that looks relative to pricing. We\u2019ve said in our headline numbers that their ASPs tend to be 10% to 15% below our heritage business. I think that\u2019s entirely true. I think what you\u2019ll see probably over the fullness of time issue, we\u2019ll see things probably move a little bit better in the nearer term in places like Georgia. Yes, I think you\u2019ll see them then move in medium term more in places like Maryland. I think markets such as Kentucky, which simply does not have the type of robustness in many respects that you have in places like Georgia and Maryland will move upwardly and a little bit slower rhythm and cadence, but nonetheless, I think in a rhythm and cadence that will be value creating very appropriate, and by the way, from, from our perspective, not at all surprising.","Adrian Huerta","That\u2019s great. Thank you so much. Appreciate your feedback.","Ward Nye","Thank you Adrian.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, good afternoon. A mountain quarry typically see some losses in asphalt, so that\u2019s not unusual, but there was no improvement since last year and last year, I know you, you were lagging the recovery of inflation. Can you just give some color there in terms of what you\u2019re seeing on price cost and what pricing on asphalts looking like as the construction season gets underway?","Ward Nye","Yes, I guess, I\u2019d say a couple of things to your point. Q1 volumes were down 29%, but winter had the biggest impact on that simply due to temperature and specification. So the front range had a real winter this year. It was colder, it was wetter. And clearly we felt that. If we\u2019re looking at pricing, Q1 asphalt pricing was actually up 4%. So we think that\u2019s a nice harbinger of things to come for the year. If we\u2019re looking at Q1 asphalt and paving backlogs and this is what I think is really important, Michael, there were up to 60%. So, I mean, that\u2019s a very nice pipeline that we have on the business.","If we look at the way it\u2019s spread across the business too, that\u2019s important because in keeping with the commentary we\u2019ve had on the call so far, Q1 infrastructure up 46%. Q1 res up 39%, Q1 non-res up 15%, all of these versus the prior year quarter again in that Colorado business. So, if we\u2019re looking at what the downstream businesses looking like they are, we think it really is very attractive. We talked about some of the cash flow issues the Colorado DOT had last year that we think that they\u2019ve clearly found their way through. So we\u2019re feeling very confident on that business right now. If we look at our overall infrastructure Q1 backlog in asphalt, it represents 50% of the total asphalt and paving backlog versus 46% last year. So it\u2019s not just that we feel like we\u2019ve got good work ahead of us, we\u2019ve got good work ahead of us in areas that we anticipated that we would have good work.","Michael Wood","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, in terms of the Texas cement market, just curious, what is needed there in terms of growth for the first demand outstrip domestic supply and roughly what can you tell us on the import price differential versus domestic pricing?","Ward Nye","Yes, I guess what I would say is, would there be room to add a few hundred thousand tons here or there in Texas, they probably could at the same time, that\u2019s a marketplace that, we\u2019re pretty happy with whether that marketplaces is working right now. So we don\u2019t feel the need to add much to that. I would think the input in Houston, the differential can be \u2013 let\u2019s call it low-20s, the delta on occasion, but then you\u2019ve got transportation logistics that they\u2019d come into play once it gets there so it can move around pretty considerably, Michael. That\u2019s a tough number to nail with precision.","Michael Wood","Great. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thomson Davis. Your line is open.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey, good morning guys. Nice quarter.","Ward Nye","Thanks Adam.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey, ward. April was a little wetter year-over-year. Did that give you any pause vis-\u00e0-vis the guidance?","Ward Nye","Yes. I\u2019ll tell you the one thing that you\u2019ve always seen us do is draw a really bright line between the quarter just ended and the new quarter, it\u2019s starting, because I know if I ever say anything about it, then people will think, well, he\u2019s talking about it because he\u2019s good. And if I don\u2019t say something and they\u2019re going to extrapolate, he\u2019s not saying anything because it\u2019s bad. I will tell you, part of what you\u2019ve heard us say is, we feel really good about a year right now, Adam and I would \u2013 I feel really good about the year.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay, fair enough. And then, last thing, I was just hoping you could walk us around Texas. What are you seeing by the major \u2013 in the major metros for this year?","Ward Nye","Look, I happy to try to do that. I think Dallas, Fort Worth is going to continue to be a really attractive marketplace. Being part of what I like about that marketplace is it stays good on both the public and the private side. We\u2019ve talked about what\u2019s happening there relative to the large design build work that\u2019s coming, but here\u2019s what\u2019s important about that, Adam. I mean, you\u2019ve got $1.6 billion worth of design build work around $635 million in Dallas, but, and there\u2019s $520 million of it going on in Austin. There\u2019s $4.2 billion of it in Houston in $1.8 billion coming in San Antonio.","Actually, what I think we\u2019re going to see this year and we\u2019d like this is we\u2019re seeing a much healthier Central Texas or San Antonio that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years looking really at those marketplaces. That\u2019s been one of the tougher ones in Texas, and what striking to me is still, if we\u2019re looking at employment and metrics for the state, Texas is still ranked first as of March, 2019 in employment growth versus the prior year. But think of it in these terms too, I mean Texas with all the growth that it\u2019s had is still second in total housing permits and second in single family permits and number one in multifamily.","So when, when we look at all of that, then come back and say, what could the prospect of that state look like when these energy projects really come to some degree fruition with 24 million tons of aggregates, 2.9 million cubic yards of ready mix and 1.6 million tons of cement. These are all pretty striking numbers in a state where we\u2019ve got the largest aggregates, cement and ready mix position in between Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio. So that\u2019s a long way of saying. Yes, I\u2019ve listened to economists four and five years ago, say Texas was going into a slow down. Our team all looked at each other at the time and said, we don\u2019t see it, and we continue to see a very healthy Texas marketplace.","Adam Thalhimer","Great. Thanks Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Adam. Howard, are there any others in the queue?","Operator","I\u2019m showing no additional audio questions in the queue at this time, sir.","Ward Nye","Well, thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call with our steadfast commitment to safety, cost, discipline, and operational excellence.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company\u2019s prepared remarks. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I will now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.","Suzanne Osberg","Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today\u2019s discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q2 2019 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends.","As detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise.","We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today\u2019s earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Unless otherwise noted, all financial and operating results discussed today are for the second quarter 2019 and the comparisons of versus the prior year second quarter, and all margin references are based on revenues. When providing certain comparisons with prior periods, we have excluded the operating results of acquired businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed. We refer to these comparisons as same store information. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q2 2019 supplemental information and SEC filings.","We will begin today\u2019s earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our second quarter operating performance as well as market trends. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow.","I will now turn the call over to Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. We're proud to report second quarter results that established new company records for revenues, gross profit and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, driven by double digit aggregate shipments growth, continued pricing momentum across our building materials business and improve cost control.","Consolidated total revenues increased 6% to $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA to $378 million and fully diluted earnings per share to $3.01. This impressive second quarter performance underscores Martin Marietta strong execution and superior strategic position, which are allowing us to capitalize on the strength of product demand in our key regions.","Attractive market fundamentals including notable employment gains, population growth and superior state fiscal health continued to promote steady and sustainable construction growth and favorable pricing trends across our geographic footprint in the second quarter. Consistent with our expectations, construction growth in our top 10 states is outpacing the nation as a whole. We anticipate further acceleration in construction activity during the second half of this year, supported by strength in public and private sector spending. These attractive dynamics combined with our strong first half performance position Martin Marietta for increased shipments, pricing and profitability and underpinned our confidence that we will deliver another record year. That's why it's announced in today's release, we raise the midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance by $32.5 million.","Our second quarter results can best be summarized as a tale of two geographies. Much of Martin Marietta's Eastern footprint, most notably North Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, as well as Iowa benefited from robust underlying demand, his customers continued to address whether deferred projects and growing backlogs. By contrast, the company's two largest states by revenues, Texas and Colorado, experienced extreme weather patterns during the quarter that hindered construction activity and negatively impacted our aggregates, cement and downstream operations in these regions. Aggregate shipments increased 10% for the company as a whole or 6% on a same store basis. All divisions achieved growth with the exception of our Southwest division, which had relatively flat shipping volumes. Equally important for second consecutive quarter, we saw improved shipments across all three of our primary induce markets.","Aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market increased 2% as contractors advanced transportation related projects. However, major infrastructure initiatives in Texas and Colorado were delayed due to weather, thereby limiting overall gains in the quarter. We expect public construction, particularly for aggregates intensive highways and streets to accelerate throughout the remainder of the year, supported by meaningful increases in lettings and contract awards in a number of our key states, notably Texas, Colorado and Maryland. And continued funding from the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act.","We're encouraged by the two year budget deal that was reached last week in Washington DC. With that agreement now in place, we believe federal transportation funding will continue at a minimum at status quo levels. That's even absent the perspective passage of a successor infrastructure bill prior to the FAST Act's September 2020 expiration, an area the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is currently making progress. This should provide the necessary confidence and structure for states to continue to move planned and future construction projects forward. Additionally, our top 10 states which accounted for 85% of total building materials revenues in 2018, have all introduced incremental transportation funding measures within the last five years. State level funding is expected to continue to grow at a faster rate than federal funding in the near term, leading to additional growth opportunities for our company.","The infrastructure market represented 37% of our second quarter aggregate shipments, which was below the company's most recent 10 year annual average of 46%.","Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market increased 25% with strength in distribution center, warehouse, data center and wind energy projects in Texas, the Carolinas, Georgia, Iowa and Maryland. Additionally, we're benefiting from the reemergence of large energy sector projects along the Texas Gulf Coast. Looking ahead and consistent with third party forecasts, including the Dodge Momentum Index, our non-residential outlook remains positive, and projects healthy commercial construction activity, particularly in our southeastern and southwestern regions. The non-residential market represented 37% of our second quarter aggregate shipments.","Aggregate shipments to the residential market increased modestly with attractive home building activity in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida offset by weather impacted delays in Texas. Despite the recent decline and housing unit starts at the national level, we expect residential construction will continue to grow within Martin Marietta's geographic footprint driven by favorable population demographics, jobs growth, land availability, attractive mortgage rates and efficient permitting. In our view, the issuance of residential permits represents the best indicator of future housing construction activity. Currently, permit growth for our top 10 states is outpacing the national average for both multifamily and single family housing units. The residential market accounted for 21% of aggregate shipments.","To conclude our discussion on end use markets, the ChemRock\/Rail market accounted for the remaining 5% of aggregate shipments. Volumes increased to 11% driven by improved fellowship to the western Class I railroads for emergency flood repairs, notably in Colorado and the Midwest.","Based on our year-to-date performance and current trends, we also raised our full year aggregate shipment guidance from an increase of 6% to 8% to an increase of 8% to 10%. In line with internal expectations, aggregates pricing improved 3.4%. On a same store basis, pricing improved 4.1%. As a reminder, selling prices for operations required during the second quarter of 2018 are approximately 15% below the company's overall average. Our goal is to move pricing for these operations to be more in line with our broader company's selling prices.","By region, our Southeast Group achieve same store price and growth of 8%, reflecting strong underlying demand in North Georgia, and a higher percentage of long haul shipments from our higher price distribution terminals. Continued discipline but the aggregate pricing improvements of 3% for both the West Group and the Mid-America Group when compared on the same store basis. We expect overall pricing growth to accelerate throughout the remainder of 2019, now that a significant portion of prior year whether different projects have rolled off our backlogs and implemented price increases are realized.","Cement shipments declined 5%, driven by extreme precipitation in Texas, most significantly in Dallas Fort Worth, our pricing improved 5%. Underlying demand and the bidding pipeline remained robust and we believe our cement operations will continue to benefit from the tight supply in Texas.","Turning to our downstream businesses. Despite growing customer backlogs, ready mix concrete shipments decreased nearly 16% as unfavorable weather conditions in Texas and Colorado hindered construction activity in these days. Pricing improved 3% following annual price increases that became effective on April 1.","Our asphalt and paving business, which operates solely in Colorado experienced reduced production days from persistent extreme weather, including unseasonable May snowball, resulting in an 8% reduction in asphalt shipments. Asphalt pricing improved 5%, reflecting strong bidding activity and customer confidence.","We believe it will be challenging for our downstream businesses, particularly in Colorado to holding makeup weather deferred shipments in the second half of the year, given the remaining available operating days in the calendar year and the typical seasonal constraints. However, we expect any weather deferred work not completed over the balance of 2019 will be pushed into 2020.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss the specifics of our second quarter financial results.","Jim Nickolas","Thank you Ward. The building materials business achieved record quarterly products and services revenues of $1.1 billion, a 6% increase and gross profit of $328 million, a 14% increase. Aggregates product gross margin expanded 340 basis points to 33%. This margin expansion was driven by improved operating leverage from increased shipment and production levels, combined with pricing gains and the absence of the headwind from selling acquired inventory burdened by acquisition accounting in 2018. For the full year 2019, at the raised guidance levels, we still expect aggregates incremental margins on a same store basis to exceed our 60% target.","Moving now to cement. For the second quarter, despite the nearly 5% decrease in shipments, cement product gross margin of 37.6% increased 110 basis points, driven by improve pricing, production efficiencies and lower maintenance costs. Magnesia Specialties continued to benefit from a solid global domain for magnesia chemical products, generating product revenues of $70 million and product gross profit of $29 million, both quarterly records. Payroll product mix, production efficiencies and lower energy costs contributed to the 500 basis point expansion of product gross margin to 41.5%. Our consolidated results included a $16 million out of pure expense to correct the overstatement of equity earnings from a non-consolidated affiliate in prior periods. This pretax non-cash adjustment was recorded in other non-operating expenses net and as a non-recurring item.","Looking ahead, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $165 million higher than in 2018. We will use the resulting increase in discretionary cash flow for the continued execution of a balanced capital allocation strategy. We remain focused on creating shareholder value through value enhancing acquisitions, proven organic capital investment, and the opportunistic deployment of free cash flow through shared purchases and dividends, all well returning to a target leverage ratio.","For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to range from $350 million to $400 million as we invest in highly term projects. These projects are predominantly geared towards generating greater efficiencies to drive continued margin expansion, though some are specifically focused on increasing targeted capacity.","In May, we declared our 100th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. We are proud to be the only public company in our industry to have never reduced or suspended our dividend payments over this time. A testament to our consistent focus and balance sheet strength and operational excellence. Additionally, we returned $50 million to shareholders through the purchase of 230,400 shares of common stock. These shares were repurchased at an approximate price of $215 per share.","Since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February, 2015, we've returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases, as well as meaningful and sustainable dividends.","Our ratio of consolidate net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our applicable credit agreement was 2.7 times for the trailing 12 months ended June, 2019. While this remains modestly above the top end of our target leverage ratio, we expect to continue deleveraging was an anticipated return to our target leverage ratio up to 2.5 times by the end of the third quarter.","As details in today\u2019s release, we raised our full year 2019 guidance to reflect our strong first-half performance and current trends. On a consolidated basis, we expect total revenues to range from $4.535 billion to $4.730 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range $1.200 billion to $1.350 billion.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ward.","Ward Nye","Jim, thanks. To conclude, we\u2019re extremely pleased with our second quarter performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019. During our 25 years as a public company, Martin Marietta has responsibly managed and grown our business to create long term shareholder value. We\u2019re committed to building on our track record of price discipline, strategic geographic positioning, and prudent capital allocation, all the form maintaining our focus on safety, cost discipline, operational excellence, and customer service to drive continued profitability and growth in 2019 and beyond.","The operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens. Your line is open.","Trey Grooms","Hey, good morning, Ward, Jim and Suzanne.","Ward Nye","Good morning, Trey.","Trey Grooms","I guess first for me, you mentioned that, clearly the cement business volume impacted by weather in the quarter, but pricing was still very good, which indicating strong underlying demand. And I guess the same can be said for ready mix and hot mixed asphalt as well. But can you talk a little bit about, the weather impact what that might have had in the quarter to volume, especially in cement? But then also and I guess more importantly, how you\u2019re performing and what you\u2019re seeing out there since July looks like it\u2019s the weather is finally starting to cooperate a little bit better for you guys, can kind of talk about what you\u2019re seeing there, especially in the cement business?","Ward Nye","Trey, thanks for your question. A couple of things. One, if we just look at the second quarter, cement had 15 more days impacted by rain in this quarter than it did last year. To give you a sense of it, that\u2019s about 13 inches of incremental rainfall that we experienced in that Northern and Central Texas area. So that was clearly something that pushed back on the volume. I think your point is actually a very good one. To see volume down and see ASP up 5%, I think it\u2019s a wonderful sign of an underlying marketplace that we think is attractive. There are several observations on that note. One, we did see pricing up nicely in North Texas. We also saw pricing up nicely in Central Texas. So we\u2019re seeing it up at both Midlothian as well as Hunter. So we see what we think is going to be a very busy second half of the year. As you know, typically I don\u2019t call outside of the lines and talk about specific months in the quarter that we\u2019re in right now, I\u2019d like to talk about the quarter that has just concluded. But obviously, we have a great deal of confidence in what have to is going to look like, what else we would not have modified our guidance going forward.","More specifically, Trey, if you look at the guidance and see where the moving parts are on that, you\u2019ll see volume growth, as we\u2019ve highlighted in aggregates, but you will also see looking at cement, that we\u2019ve taken up our product revenues and we\u2019ve taken up our gross profit for the business. So I think if you take a look at where pricing is, and what we\u2019ve done relative to our guidance, that does give you a good sense of at least how we viewing have to.","The other thing to remember is we did a lot of investment in our tones in the first half of this year. So we also think the cost profile of that business have to look very attractive.","Trey Grooms","Got it. Okay, that \u2013 thanks for all that color, Ward, appreciate it. And then I guess as my follow up. You mentioned, I think this is specifically to aggregates that overall pricing that you\u2019re expecting that pricing growth to accelerate to 2019, as some of these older projects roll off, as you kind of play some catch up, I guess with some of that pent up demand. Can you give us any more color about that? I know you reiterated your guide for the full year. But just any sense that you can give us on how what kind of impact that had to maybe the first half pricing and then a way that we can maybe think about that acceleration, kind of going into the back half of the year?","Ward Nye","Sure. Thank you for that, Trey. I guess I would say, do keep in mind, we are seeing hard work roll off, you see what the price increases were. I think the other thing that\u2019s worth noting is if we look at the quarter, actually, we had a very strong quarter in particular, in our Midwest, and Mideast divisions, those are really not two of our overall higher price divisions as you compare them, for example, two parts of the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast.","So we think we\u2019re likely to see natural price increases come in. We think we\u2019re likely to see some geographic mix that\u2019s going to be in our favor. And one thing I have to say for operating group to as I reflect on that, to have had the type of growth that we did in Midwest and Mideast, to have had a very wet quarter in Texas and Colorado are two largest states by revenue and to put up 63% incremental margins on a same store basis in the quarter, I think it\u2019s a really good story but I think those building blocks I gave you at the beginning of that answer relative to pricing is what gives us confidence in the way the blog will look for the rest of the year.","Trey Grooms","Yeah, make sense. I\u2019ll go ahead and pass it on. Thanks, Ward and congrats on the good quarter.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Trey.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. Just a follow-up cleanup question on guidance and modest revision upwards. Can you look at more clarity on how much higher volumes versus lower costs contributed to that delta, both on the aggregate and on the snip side. And could you also confirm the guidance still includes relatively better weather, as you outlined in the previous quarter? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Sure. Kathryn, good to hear your voice. A couple of things as we got walk through the guidance. And so to be very granular on it, original guidance on volume growth for aggregates was 6 to 8. Now it\u2019s 8 to 10. So as we\u2019re looking at that, one thing that we just have to recognize is we\u2019ve hit the midpoint of our guidance relative to volumes in half one. So as we look at it, where we think half two is going to be, we think non-residential is going to stay good. We\u2019re seeing nicely continuing recovery in the Southeast. We think infrastructure looks good in multi-year basis and our customers are thinking backlogs.","On the last part of the call, I spoke to a degree on cement with respect to Trey\u2019s question, the one thing that we haven\u2019t changed is our view, at least on the 3 to 5 on ASP. So again, the pricing side has stayed static. The only part of our guidance, really, Kathryn that we took down was the guidance relative to our downstream businesses. In large part recognizing that we are planning for a second half wetter than normal, and we\u2019re planning for a normal onset of wetter in the Rocky Mountains. So really, if we take those two factors, and try to determine what the runway just for the rest of the year could look like from a timing perspective on downstream businesses, we\u2019ve tightened that up a bit. Do I think our cost profile will get better? Yeah, I think it could. I think if you look at half one, the cost profile actually looks pretty good. I think if we look at cost in cement, clearly, we have done a lot of what we would do on those. I think our labor costs are very nicely controlled.","I think if you look at where we sit relative to costs with respect to fuel and otherwise today. That\u2019s been a pretty good story, we think it\u2019ll stay that way. If we look year-to-date, just for diesel fuel, June expenses were down 1.5 million lower than prior year, that\u2019s for the first six months on five point more \u2013 5.4% more gallons. So keep in mind, we\u2019re going to have a full year of Bluegrass in fuel numbers. Again, for your quick use, we used about 47.5 million gallons last year. I think our MNR can look pretty good in the second half. If you look at what we have done relative to CapEx over the last several years, that should continue to be a very good story on our cost profile. You know what said when you put in that group CapEx, what it can do to DD&A is push that up very modestly, as you work those costs off overtime. But Kathryn, if you\u2019re looking at labor, you look at DD&A, maintenance and repair and energy. You\u2019ve worked through close to 30% of your costs on labor, and then at heavier costs at 15% after that, and given what we think can be the volume leverage, we think cost profile can again be very attractive. I hope that color was helpful.","Kathryn Thompson","Yeah. Shifting to the policy side, I know that we as a firm, spend a lot of time on DOTs, you are seeing some good learning from that, it\u2019s good to see. But maybe shifting to the focus in DC, given yesterday\u2019s EPW meeting, and Mr. President\u2019s tweet earlier this morning on potential progress, not that we really want to focus on that. But what are your thoughts in terms of realistically, what\u2019s going on in DC for long term highlight? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Kathryn. I guess a couple of things. I mentioned in my prepared comments, two things. I mentioned, the bipartisan two year agreement that was basically met last week, which we thought was encouraging. And that\u2019s what gives us confidence around in a worst case scenario, something that feels like flat on infrastructure actually liked very much again, I referenced this in the prepared comments what EPW did yesterday. So you\u2019ve got a republican controlled environment and Public Works Committee and the Senate, that\u2019s basically authorizing a 27% increase in transportation spending. That\u2019s notable.","The thing to remember is Kathryn, historically, the way that this works and reauthorization process is usually it\u2019s kicked to the house in the first instance. And the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee looks at this comes out with their view of the bill and then Senator EPW comes in afterward. I think the fact that the republican controlled senate and EPW has come up with a nice increase on what they\u2019re calling America\u2019s Transportation Infrastructure Act, in the first instance, is really attractive for what we may watch for coming out of House T&I. You know and I know that the real debate is going to be around, what would the pay for look like? I believe the debate around pay will be divided somewhere between varying degrees of user fees, whether it be truck rates, whether it be electric car batteries or otherwise, or fuel gas taxes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be any one of those. I think it\u2019s going to be an array of those. I think we\u2019ll have good policy. The debate is going to be around what funding is going to be, but I think we have a President who would like to see it. We clearly have a democratic congress that would like to see it. And we have a republican control EPW that has come out with what we feel like it\u2019s a very good start. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad place to be here as we enter have to this year.","Kathryn Thompson","All right. Thank you very much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Schrier with Citi. Your line is open.","Scott Schrier","Hi, good morning and nice quarter. I wanted to start on a downstream strategy. If I look at the cement internal and external shipment dynamics, is there anything to look into or read into there? You had pretty good pricing, does that mean that makes more sense to sell more externally and hold off on some of the internal sales? Obviously, concrete margins were pretty light. I got it, there was some fixed costs, absorption. But if I think about, I mean you\u2019re looking at some of these fundamentals, how much of a need for the expanse of network of ready mix, do you actually need? And then, similar, if we look at ready mix pricing is up 2.5% year-on-year roughly the same sequentially, given cement price moves, given aggregates price moves and labor. I would have looked for more, so also, is it competition there, the Colorado verse Texas dynamics, how do you think about material spread? So I know it kind of packed up a little bit there but any color you could give that would be appreciated?","Ward Nye","You know you bet. Scott, I guess several things, one, looking at margins in cement that are in the mid to high 30s to something will take every day. So that\u2019s a business that actually performed well in the quarter when I think if somebody was saying what\u2019s this cement business is simply going to look like in a wet second quarter in Texas. I\u2019m not sure if people would have thought it would have looked that good. I think the ready mix business, basically looking at the weather that they had in Texas, actually performed reasonably well. I do like the fact that you\u2019re seeing the ASPs go up. Are you seeing ASPs go up more quickly in a market like Colorado, than you are in a marketplace like Texas? The answer is yes. But equally were the markets in Texas that were hit hardest by rain, specific North Texas and around DFW, some of our higher priced ready mix markets, the answer to that question is equally, yes.","So again, if we look at the position that we have in Texas, we are the largest producer of aggregates, we are the largest producer of cement and we\u2019re the leading ready mix producer. But again, we focus that in a very intentional fashion in that large Texas triangle, we feel like that\u2019s a \u2013 that market is built in a vertically integrated fashion. We\u2019re a leader in that market and we\u2019ve been able to as we go through cycles to extract value all the way through our product offerings in that marketplace.","So what I would suggest to you is much of what you\u2019re looking at relative to the downstream businesses in Q2 was a weather event driven circumstance. I think cement performed in that \u2013 in that marketplace extraordinarily well. And again, I would take you back to the ASPs, seeing ASPs up 3 and ready mix with volume down 16. Actually, I think that tells you the story on what the underlying demand looks like. And we do like our position all the way through the products in that state, Scott.","Scott Schrier","Great. Ward, thanks for that. Good color. My follow-up, I wanted to move back to the aggregates and specifically in the Southeast. Obviously, you\u2019re seeing nice pricing growth from the long haul shipment, you have volumes coming back. I\u2019m wondering if you could speak to the margin profile you\u2019re seeing in those regions. I know in the past, you\u2019ve had a chart that basically showed the Southeast was further from peak levels of profitability, then some of your more legacy assets. So can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing from a logistics perspective and rail overwater? And how much \u2013 the efficiencies that you\u2019re getting and how you look at the potential to grow that region in terms of margin and profit dollars?","Ward Nye","No, sure, Scott, I\u2019ll do that. And keep in mind, we have to be careful because we can have terms of art when we speak to the Southeast and we can have just normal conversational tones of what we mean when we\u2019re talking about the Southeast to United States. So I think at times people are looking at our Southeast business. At times, they\u2019re looking at the bottom right hand corner of the map of the United States. But I would say is this, and let\u2019s talk about the bottom right hand corner of the map of the United States, because I think that\u2019s how people think of that business.","If we\u2019re looking at North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida in particular, those are states that overtime, we would have expected some of the most attractive if not the single most attractive margins that we would see in our business. Clearly, you\u2019re seeing I say, ASP rise in the Southeastern United States, in part because to your point, if you look at Georgia and North Carolina, in particular have been, they\u2019re still around 28-ish percent below mid cycle on volumes, but they\u2019ve not behave from a pricing perspective, is it that they\u2019re that far off on volumes.","So what we\u2019re seeing in this quarter for an example, is we\u2019re seeing places like Greensboro in North Carolina, recovering in a very nice way for literally about the first time in a decade. We think that\u2019s incredibly important as Raleigh been in recovery mode, it has been has Charlotte been yes. Has Greensboro lag it has, and it\u2019s doing noticeably better now. Yes, equally Atlanta coming out of the recession, Atlanta, as you recall, Scott, was hit disproportionately hard. Atlanta send a very nice recovery mode now on both public and private work. And if we look at Georgia DOT budget today is really considerably more attractive than it was several years ago. But if we\u2019re looking at some very large projects that are likely to be led in that marketplace over the next several years, we think that\u2019s important. It\u2019s probably worth looking at some point of major mobility investment program that George is looking at and targeting around $12 billion to reduce congestion along key carter\u2019s in that state.","So I think back to your question. If you\u2019re looking at the Southeastern United States, we think the recovery is early, we think the recovery is notable. And I think your observation that you\u2019re not hearing us had broad based concerns around rail performance is notable. I mean, obviously we saw good performance from the railroads in the Western U.S. in the first half and we continue to have good service from the railroads in the east. We think all that pretends very well for that Southeastern portion of our business.","Scott Schrier","Thanks for that. Appreciate it and good luck.","Ward Nye","You bet, Scott. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Ward, strong quarter, pretty impressed in this tough environment.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Phil.","Phil Ng","Sure. It seems like the bottlenecks that you saw last year whether it\u2019s rail and labor trying to clear up. Is that fair and you know, what\u2019s your ability to kind of play catch up in the back half? And I\u2019m just curious do you and your customers, how the bandwidth is for, stronger demand. Is there like a governor on terms of how fast shipments could be up this year?","Ward Nye","You know couple of things, one, I think you\u2019re entirely right. Part of what we said last year was we thought logistics would get better. We thought trucking would get better, and we thought rail would get better. And we didn\u2019t think it would be cured over a quarter, but we thought it would be cured over the course of several quarters. And I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s cured, but we are saying it\u2019s considerably better. So I think what we have learned in that respect is about right.","With respect to labor, I\u2019m going to bifurcated that and I\u2019m going to speak to it in two halves. The first half is what does our labor look like? Do we have the capacity in most instances to put the stone on the ground that\u2019s required for projects, including wrap up? The short answers yeah, I think we do. I think we could certainly do that. Is there a governor at times in certainly markets relative to contract labor, I think to a degree in some markets, if you have a higher degree of seasonality in a market, you can have some of that today? It\u2019s odd to look at it and see volume up 10%. And be talking about a governor because we actually like what we saw in the quarter. We like what we\u2019ve seen in the first half, we think it\u2019s going to be a very busy second half. We are not going to be labor constrained. In our side of the equation, it will see how hard contractors can run. I will tell you; I think contractors are doing a considerably better job of putting material down when they can.","I think the last several years of being extremely wet. We have pushed contractors to adjust their schedules, and we see them overcoming bottlenecks in ways in 2019, that I don\u2019t think we would have seen in 2017. Now to the extent that they can\u2019t get all the work done that they would like to in 2019, the good news is I think it gets pushed into 2020. So I think we\u2019re looking at something that we\u2019ve already captioned is going to be a record year this year. And I like how much build I see at this point going into 2020.","Phil Ng","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful color. And then the growth that you saw in non-residential was impressive. I think you\u2019re seeing double-digit growth, and you\u2019re calling for a pretty noticeable uptick for the rest of the year. It sounds like you\u2019re starting to see some of those energy projects you\u2019ve been talking about into Gulf coming through, one is that correct? And how should we think about this opportunity next few years?","Ward Nye","Okay, thank you for the observation on that. I would say two things. Are we seeing some of the energy projects in the Gulf come through? The answer is yes. I mean, to give you a sense of it we will probably sell a million tons to some of those projects this year. But here\u2019s what I think is more impressive about what we saw the court on non-residential, and that was it was broad based. If we\u2019re looking at the Southwest, the mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the Mideast, the Southeast, they were all up on non-res. So we\u2019re not saying one big project in one part of the country that\u2019s just soaking up all the noise on non-res. We\u2019re saying good energy activity as I just indicated. We\u2019re seeing reasonable sale activity. We\u2019re seeing continued warehousing activity. We\u2019re seeing large distribution activity. We\u2019re seeing wind farms. We\u2019re seeing datacenters.","So part of what I like about non-res is it seems to be fairly widely dispersed. And one of the things that you\u2019ve heard us speak to Phil, is how important we believe it is to grow our businesses on these notable and significant corridors. So on I-25, and I-35 and I-85 and I-95 and interstate 40, all of which are very active quarters for corridors for traffic. We\u2019re seeing notable non-res activity in those corridors and we\u2019re participating in those in ways that we would have expected. So is a 37% overall piece of the pie on non-res notable it is. But we think it\u2019s got some sustainability to it. Based on the numbers that we\u2019re seeing we believe that it does. Again, I want to give you some color there, Phil.","Phil Ng","That\u2019s really helpful. And just one last one, if I may. Your incremental margin guidance implies a noticeable step up. Can you provide a little more color on the key drivers? That gives you that confidence that the full year, it\u2019s tracking \u2013 expected track north of the year, longer term 60% target? Thanks, and good luck in quarter.","Jim Nickolas","Yeah, Phil, it\u2019s Jim. So the answer to that is really just continued performance that you\u2019ve seen this year continuing in the second half of this year, coupled with the fact that we\u2019re comparing versus prior second half a very, very weather impacted effect the third and fourth quarter. So really continued good performance, stable performance from our perspective this year, for an easy count for the back half the year.","Ward Nye","And Phil, just as reminder, when we hit 63% in the second quarter with our top two states hit hard by weather and without a big place in the East being really driven by the Midwest and Mid-East, again, I think that underscores Jim\u2019s point, we feel pretty good about where the incrementals are going.","Phil Ng","Okay, thanks a lot.","Ward Nye","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois","Hi, thanks. Just on infrastructure. Clearly your leading indicators are quite positive. But rough about 2% infrastructure in the front half a year to get to your outlook for high single-digits for the full year implies, high single digits\u2026","Ward Nye","Operator, I lost Garik.","Garik Shmois","Hello, can you hear me?","Ward Nye","We can hear you now. We lost you for a second, Garik. You were saying that implies high single digits for the second half. I think it\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?","Garik Shmois","Yeah, I think maybe a little bit more than high single-digit growth in the second half for infrastructure. And, if that is the case, is there any price mix impact, just given the timing of some of the shipments in infrastructure that you might experience?","Ward Nye","Yeah, the only thing that I could say relative to mix is if you do end up with more brand new infrastructure project starting, you could see a higher degree of base move on those. And again, the margins that we would experience some base sales is not going to be notably different than the margin, we might experience some clean. But as you know, you can have a 25% to 30% delta in ASP moving from a base product to a clean stone product.","So could you see some bit of that in that? I suppose. Are we concerned that that might do anything to change our guidance? We\u2019re not concerned about that Garik. And I guess the other thing that I would say is we\u2019ve spoken with our customers about their backlogs. That\u2019s really what gives us the competence as we look into have to relative to infrastructure because we\u2019re looking at Mid-Atlantic backlogs that customers would say, from their perspective, or up at times to read 30% if where they were last year, we\u2019re looking at backlogs in the Midwest, where customers are saying they may be up as much as 25% of where they were in the prior year. We\u2019re looking the Southwest same type of activity. Customers are saying they may be up as much as 14%. And when we\u2019re talking to customers in cement, they\u2019re talking about numbers that can even be ahead of those percentages that I just gave you.","So if we\u2019re looking at where DOTs are and they are bidding, and what\u2019s happening. And keep in mind, you\u2019ve got $8.7 billion worth and Texas going up to 9.1 next year. Colorado\u2019s got to point $2.2 billion DOT budget this year versus $1.6 billion last year. North Carolina is expecting a record year. We\u2019re looking at Florida at $10.8 billion for FY 2019-2020. And we\u2019re looking at Maryland at the largest P3 Highway project in North America. So if we think about really why we have confidence in the continued emergence of public works, it\u2019s the customer backlogs and it\u2019s the dialogue come in the DOTs that gives us that underlying confidence.","Garik Shmois","Okay. That\u2019s good color, thanks. Other question is just on cement in the maintenance expense, you indicated that you pull forward [Technical Difficulty] how much maintenance you incurred in the second half of 2018 and just [Technical Difficulty]?","Ward Nye","Yeah, look, for the full year 2018, we had, it looks like it\u2019s $14.4 million worth of expenses, we\u2019re looking at $19.2 million worth of expenses this year. And again, the biggest piece of that was front loaded. So we feel like we\u2019re going to be in a very attractive year. We\u2019re $5 million more into killing expense in the first half of this year versus where we were in the last year. So you can take those numbers and get a very good build as you go through.","Garik Shmois","Okay, yeah, sure. Thanks again.","Ward Nye","Okay, thank you, Garik.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliott with Stifel. Your line is open.","Stanley Elliott","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe you can start by kind of give us an update on thoughts around Bluegrass, you guys have had it for a year anniversary of it. You certainly mentioned Maryland and North Georgia key contributors in the quarter. I\u2019d love to see kind of here rather kind of thoughts around how the integration went, if there were any additional synergy that there were to come out? And I\u2019ll let you take it from there.","Ward Nye","Stanley thanks for the question. I guess several things. One, this was in fact the finest quarter that we\u2019ve had with Bluegrass since it\u2019s been under our ownership. We saw nice incremental tonnage for the quarter. We\u2019ve seen nice incremental tonnage for the first half. We exceeded all the synergy targets that we projected. And remember Stanley, this energy targets, we projected we\u2019re operating synergy target. So I\u2019d like to say we\u2019re getting those the hard way. We think culturally, we have brought a business into our business that has worked extraordinarily well.","So for example, I\u2019m really very proud to tell you that through the first half of the year, there were no last time insurance at any Bluegrass site. And that\u2019s a very different story than it was last year. And you recall, that\u2019s the same type of story that we had after we had acquired TXI. So are we pleased with much larger position, particularly in Atlanta than then we had before? Yeah, we are. Do we feel like that positions is particularly well, as we start thinking about what Georgia DOT will do over the next several years on that major mobility investment program? Yeah, we do.","Being in Maryland, for you got the largest P3 activity in the country. And we think is an exciting place to be. And I will tell you a couple of weeks ago, I was looking through the Bluegrass operations in Kentucky that has fit very nicely into our Southern Ohio Business. Very good people, very good operations, doing everything that we thought it would do. So yes, we\u2019re very pleased with every aspect of that. I did give some commentary in my prepared remarks on our views on what we think we would like to be able to do commercially with that business going forward and we will continue to be focused on that.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect. And then, one last one, I guess, maybe for you to kind of think about CapEx stand run rate for the business. You mentioned some pretty spectacular, pretty significant increases on some of the backlog for some of your customer work. When we think about CapEx remaining at this level on a go forward basis and then two, kind of how do you think about managing the debt levels into next year, primarily, since you\u2019re going to be way through that the leverage target?","Jim Nickolas","Sure, we\u2019re expecting our CapEx, again, consistent with last year is consistent with our guidance between $315 million to $400 million this year, maybe up incrementally more, if think about as percent of sales as a business grows, will have to, pro rata increase CapEx to some degree just to keep the equipment will maintain et cetera, as we grow. But the more interesting question is next year, I think once we get to our target, that the EBITDA ratio, the target leverage zone two to two and a half times, which will be out by the end of the year, they will have free cash flow and more options to deploy, their free cash flow and I think we need to pull back on our \u2013 you\u2019ve heard before our strategic plan for that cash flows is first and foremost of investing in the business and also then the value adding acquisitions. So that is something we think we\u2019ve done well, historically. We think we\u2019ve got more opportunity there. There\u2019s more room to consolidate. And we\u2019ll take advantage of that, at that point. Still we have beyond, of course, we will return to shareholders in the form of opportunistic share repurchases and higher dividends.","Ward Nye","Stanley, Jim has a high class problem. And that is he gets to go out and do the largest \u2013 second largest transaction our company\u2019s history last April. And by the time he gets to the end of third quarter this year, he\u2019s back within his target ratio. So again, making sure that we use that money really wisely is going to be a key priority for us.","Stanley Elliott","Yeah, you know, it\u2019s certainly great setup. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it and best of luck.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Stanley.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey, good morning. Great quarter.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Adam.","Adam Thalhimer","Ward, I\u2019m curious, I want to ask about residential first, the permit activity has slowed at least on national basis. What do you see on the ground in your market?","Ward Nye","I guess what I would say is this, if you look at our top 10 states, several things worth noting. We\u2019re clearly outperforming the nation. So if we look at our top 10, as you said, national prominence relatively flat, our top 10 are up four. If we look at single family, they\u2019re up to, if you look at multifamily, we\u2019re up nine versus the nation up one. So I think that just underscores why where you are in this business matters so desperately. We\u2019re seeing affordability best in places like the Midwest, the Southeast, and Southwest. And we think if you look at those regions of the country, that\u2019s simply where we have a very notable geographic advantage. And if you look at where the population trends are going, we like where we\u2019re sitting there as well. So as we look at housing, and again, it was something I tried to speak to and my prepared remarks, we see that in Martin Marietta geographies continuing to be very attracted. The piece of it that surprised me, Adam, has been the resilience of multifamily and I think in many respects, multifamily has continued to be resilient, because homeowners, home builders are shifting to more affordable homes right now. But at the same time, there\u2019s some real estate that has to be acquired for them to do that. So I think we\u2019re going to end up with something on multifamily that continues to look attractive. And I think we\u2019ve got the next leg of single family on affordable res that\u2019s still ahead of us.","Adam Thalhimer","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then I wanted to ask about thoughts and M&A in general, kind of piggy backing on Stanley\u2019s question, I guess, because you ended his question saying, you have a lot of cash. That\u2019s important to figure out how to deploy that deployed here. As it relates to any large deals, I mean, do you guys thinking in the pay down debt before you pull off a large deal?","Ward Nye","We\u2019re going to try to keep the appropriate balance. And we\u2019re going to be moved, but what is \u2013 what is the deal? I mean, at the end of the day, what I think people expect us to do, is to do the right transactions for the long term Martin Marietta shareholder. And I think that was TXI. I think that was swapping the river for the Rockies. I think that was doing Bluegrass. And if you look at your question, specifically around large transactions, if you look at the large transactions that we\u2019ve done as a company, and what we\u2019ve been able to do relative to integrating those and standardizing those transactions, I think we\u2019ve got an incredibly capable team of people here who assess those transactions, and then also an incredible cable team who integrate those transactions. So to the extent that the large deals become available, if they do, and they\u2019re in markets that we find moving, if they can be done in a fashion that builds value, we\u2019re going to be there. But equally, I would suggest to you that we have been very disciplined. And when the transaction doesn\u2019t work, we will quit simply walk away from it.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay, thanks, Ward.","Ward Nye","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone.","Ward Nye","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Hey, Ward, over the past 25 years, you folks have been able to compound pricing closer to 5%, in aggregates and this year, obviously an uptick from last year, but still at 4%, that\u2019s below the pricing increases that you\u2019ve been able to achieve historically. So can you just talk about, is there a path to get to the historical 5% type increases from here? Can you step us through how you\u2019re thinking about it?","Ward Nye","No, Jerry, I think they\u2019re clearly, yes, I think several things play into that. One, what happens with the volume profile? So to your point, you\u2019re looking over 25 year period that we\u2019ve been a public company for example and what we need to step back and say as we\u2019ve been through really a decade period of time, where volume has been incredibly challenged, but pricing has done very, very well. So here we are, for the first time in a long time, having a conversation about volumes up double-digits, right. And if you think back to the metric that you and I have spoken up before, Jerry, we\u2019ve said, as a practical matter, you can look at aggregate volume growth, and pricing growth, and link those two things together to a degree. And our view has long then that pricing was going to lag volume modestly in a volume recovery mode.","So if you go back over that same time frame that you\u2019re speaking of, and you take that metric that I just described, I think you would find that we\u2019re brought we\u2019ve been broadly very correct on that. And I think if we\u2019re hitting a point in time, where you really, you\u2019re starting to see infrastructure, get some legs, and you can see a greater series of volume build over a period of time. Candidly, in a world where barriers to entry, continue to be high and are getting higher for significant parts of the business. I think all those are the building blocks that leads you to the question that you\u2019re asking and why we feel confident on that.","Jerry Revich","Okay, and just to make sure, picking up the pieces that you\u2019re laying out, it sounds like you expect to have some pretty positive pricing discussions when you roll out initial 2020 pricing to your customers based on the framework that you just laid out considering how good volumes have been this year. Is that reasonable?","Ward Nye","I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of my customers, but I think it\u2019s fair to say when customers feel like they\u2019ve got good backlogs, and they\u2019ve got a good outlook is an easier pricing conversation with customers, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And lastly, private non-res, obviously that can be a chunky business in your portfolio depending on project cadence. Can you just talk about how concentrated is the growth that you\u2019re seeing in your guidance this year? In other words, is there any risk from larger projects if they\u2019re completed over the next 12 months, and there\u2019s nothing to replace them? But how \u2013 how broad based is that private non-res demand that you\u2019re seeing this year?","Ward Nye","No, that\u2019s a great question, Jerry. Look back to some of the commentary I offered before. As I look at non-res in particular is Southwest up? Yes. Up notably in a percentage? Yes. Is mid-Atlantic, same thing? Yes. Midwest, same thing. Mideast, same thing, every one of those divisions that I just called out for you, from a percentage change perspective on non-res are up double-digits. And many of these projects tend to be longer term projects. The one thing I did mention before is we\u2019re going to sell about a million tons this year into some of the large Gulf energy projects. And again, those have been slow and coming. They tend to be multi-year. And part of what I like about that Jerry is in that\u2019s \u2013 this year, we see probably five more projects that will be out for bid or award late this year, early next year, that\u2019s probably 3 million tons on those. Again, these are just broad projects. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re going to get these. And then there\u2019s tiling on another five or six that we think is a little bit farther out than that. That\u2019s about 11.5 million tons on those. So again, those are those large impact energy projects, separate and distinct from the share plays, the warehouse and the distribution, the wind farms and the datacenters. So again, we seek what we think is very attractive, widespread to your question, very specifically growth in non-res.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ward Nye","You\u2019re welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Brent Thielman","Great, thank you. Brent Thielman. Ward, great quarter. You talked a bit about this impact of base stone clean stone mix on ASP. I\u2019m curious, how those dynamics shape your guidance expectations for pricing for the second half of the year? I mean, are you factoring in a little more of an unfavorable mix there?","Ward Nye","Yeah, we\u2019re probably factoring in a modest, more favorable product mix on that infrastructure piece of that probably modestly more favorable geographic mix in some respects. So that they may wash themselves out to a degree. I think one thing that\u2019s always incumbent on us, at the end of the quarter is to walk you through it and give you but the puts and takes are on it. But again, my view on base work, just to be really clear, Brent, has always been a very positive view on base. Because what I know is, if we had the privilege of putting base down on a job, the day and the hour is going to come that we will likely put clean stone on top of that base. So it tends to be longer term, more mature type work and that\u2019s what we do best.","Brent Thielman","And Ward, is there President for when you start to see those clean stone deliveries, or is it pretty wide ranging?","Ward Nye","It\u2019s pretty wide ranging, but I would tend to put six to nine months after base that you start to see notable clean stone going on top of it.","Brent Thielman","Okay. And then I just want to follow-up on Colorado. It\u2019s been a great story for Martin Marietta for a long time, notwithstanding a long winter there. Any thoughts on the overall market, I know the housing private side has been really strong for you for quite some time. Is this transition the infrastructure, I guess big enough to continue to support the growth outlook there?","Ward Nye","Well, I think you\u2019ve got several things. One, I think you do have a good infrastructure play and good private place there. I think the other thing that\u2019s worth noting is you do have to play some plays, particularly in the northern part of that state. And part of what we tried to do is we try to be very visionary going in as depletion place occur and building rail yards. And highway 34 rail yard, which is just coming on really this year in Weld County, which is north of Denver, but south of Cheyenne is an important part of the growth story in that state. And we think we are extraordinarily well positioned in Northern Colorado, and in Denver, and now in Southern Colorado.","So remember, when we initially went into that marketplace with our asset swap, it was really a Denver North business. And now after some ball ponds that we did, several years after the initial river for the Rockies transaction, it puts us up and down that I-25 corridor in Colorado in a way that really others don\u2019t possess right now. And that\u2019s 80 plus percent of the population in the state, and in a state that has very nice population demographics, and very high environmental barriers to entry. So we think all that tallies up to what we feel like can continue to be a nice growth story for that business.","Brent Thielman","Okay, great. Thank you, best of luck.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Brent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Wood with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","Ryan Coyne","Good morning. This is Ryan calling on from Mike. You spoke to where you\u2019re seeing the most success in residential North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. But weather aside, which geographic pockets are giving you the most challenges in terms of underlying demand trends?","Ward Nye","Relative to residential for the ex-weather? I guess what I would say is, if we\u2019re looking in Florida looks good. Texas looks good. Maryland looks good. South Carolina looks good. And North Carolina multifamily looks good. I would guess that if we\u2019re looking for, where\u2019s it tougher, I guess maybe parts of the Midwest probably are not seeing the same degree of housing starts that you might see in more of the Southeast and Southwest. But again, that\u2019s not a big surprise to us, because you really see stronger population demographics moving south and toward the coastal areas.","Ryan Coyne","Great. And then cost on labor, just as cost earlier, but I\u2019m just quickly on asphalt. Can you speak to where you staying in terms of liquid asphalt cost and what your \u2013 in the second half?","Ward Nye","Sure. Look liquid asphalt costs are up there up about 15%, so if we\u2019re looking at Q2 cost per ton, it was about $443. That was up just to be clear, about $67 over prior year. We\u2019re taking full year price average might be up about 450 per ton, that\u2019s about a 12% year-over-year part. Again, what we\u2019re seeing in and hot mix is actually pretty good pricing on what we\u2019re doing as well. And then here\u2019s what I like about our hot mix business. And keep in mind, it\u2019s uniquely a Colorado business. Our current backlog on hot mix customers is considerably over where it was last year. We\u2019re looking at about a 40% increase over where it was last year. And as we spoke earlier, infrastructure backlog is up significantly as Colorado duty and the municipalities in that states have increased their funding. But equally important residential backlog has increased year-over-year, as homebuilders remain bullish and the market demand is increased there. So again a very nice public and private story for us relative to hot mix in the Colorado market.","Ryan Coyne","Thank you.","Ward Nye","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you and we have a question from Adrian Huerta with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Adrian Huerta","Thank you, Ward and Jim for taking my question and congrats on the results. One on the labor market again. Even the tight conditions, what are the challenges that contractors are facing to grow labor further and probably more specifically in states like Colorado and Texas? And my second question is regarding potential M&A. Given your large exposure to aggregate overall 70% of gross profits. How do you see and the outlook for aggregate cement and other downstream products? What is your target? Or what would you like to have in terms of mix in the long term so that you can work on acquisitions to get to that target? Thanks.","Ward Nye","Adrian, thanks for your question. I guess what I would say is relative to labor, if you look and see where the lowest unemployment numbers are, those will be the areas that contractors are struggling most. So is that at times a struggle for them and portions of the Southwest? Sure. Is it a time of struggle in Colorado? I have no doubt that it is. And at times even a struggle in Southeast. At the same time, I think what we\u2019re seeing is contractors are paying more now because I think they see more demand. And so I think that the market has responded in many respects in a way that you would have expected the market to.","With respect to growing our business, we\u2019re an aggregate slow business. You\u2019ve heard us say it for a long time, it is aggregates lead strategic cement targeted downstream, but we began with aggregates and began with that for a reason. And we do aggregates, we think very, very well. And those are the businesses that we are most moved by and those are the businesses that we will be disproportionally focused on and it's the ones that have taken us through 25 years and put us in a position that we believe that we've been able to build shareholder value very consistently. And it's a play book that we are going to stick to because we know it and we think we are good at it.","Adrian Huerta","Very clear. Thank you, Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.","Ward Nye","Thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With our step as commitment to the disciplined execution of our strategic plan and world-class attributes of our business, Martin Marietta is well positioned to deliver continued growth and enhance shareholder value.

Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.","Howard Nye","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As we announced in our earnings release this morning, second quarter 2014 results reflects record net sales of $602 million and earnings improvement. Net sales growth was driven by a 13% increase in aggregate\u2019s product line shipments and a 5% increase in aggregate\u2019s pricing compared to the second quarter of last year.","Additionally, our specialty products business again achieved new quarterly records for net sales and earnings. Importantly, the significant note that our growth was achieved in public and private sectors, a sign of economic stability and further recovery.","Our performance through the first half of the year, combined with positive trends in key economic indicators of construction activity has led us to raise our aggregate\u2019s product line volume guidance for the year to an increase to 6% to 8% over 2013.","Earlier this month, we successfully completed our acquisition of Texas Industries. This transaction was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders of both companies and enhances our strategic position in major aggregates and concrete markets in Texas.","It also provides us with participation in the growing cement markets in Texas and California at a very opportune time.","However before further discussion of the events of the quarter, let me remind you that today\u2019s teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise.","We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our second quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","Now for additional commentary on our quarterly performance. We experienced aggregate\u2019s product line volume growth in all of our end-use markets with notable strength in private construction. Shipments to the non-residential market represented 31% of our volumes and increased 16% over the prior year quarter led by both energy and commercial sectors.","We continue to benefit from our industry-leading position and participation in supplying building materials to the nation\u2019s major shale energy developments. We are also benefiting from growth in commercial construction driven partly by the ongoing residential construction recovery in a host of our markets.","The residential construction market which comprised 14% of our quarterly aggregate\u2019s volume aggregate\u2019s led private sector construction activity, shipments to this end-use increased 20% over the prior year quarter.","On a year-to-date basis, housing starts are up approximately 7%, an encouraging sign for the durability of the housing recovery. The ChemRock and Rail market comprised 10% of aggregate\u2019s shipments and increased 13%.","We were pleased to see a 9% increase in volume to the public sector which represented the remaining 45% of our aggregate\u2019s product line shipments. Growth was notable in the west and southeast groups which experienced increases of 16% and 21% respectively.","The west group improvement was driven by activity in Texas and Colorado where state department of transportation budgets have been positively affected by the ability to secure alternative financing sources.","Texas volumes reflect the ongoing benefit of nearly $8 billion in multi-year transportation projects awarded by the State Department of Transportation in 2013. Our Colorado operations are benefiting from continued reconstruction efforts following last year\u2019s historic flooding.","Additionally, earlier this year, Colorado approved its first public private partnership project to renovate and expand US highway 36 corridor. Growth in the southeast group reflects early signs of recovery in Georgia after many years of underinvestment.","The Georgia Construction Aggregate Association reports Metro Atlanta aggregate shipments increased 29% in the first half of the year and Georgia DOT aggregate\u2019s consumption increased over 11% both compared to the prior year period.","Additionally, Florida Governor Rick Scott announced a $10.2 billion DOT budget for fiscal year 2014, 2015, the highest level of infrastructure investment in Florida\u2019s history. This budget together with the state public private partnerships provides a solid multi-year outlook for infrastructure activity.","As we\u2019ve often said, geographic location is critical and we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on continued recovery. Growth in infrastructure shipments was achieved despite the overhang of the then pending of expiration of MAP-21, the current federal highway build.","We believe this demonstrates a strong underlying demand for infrastructure investment and the fact that was underscored recently when the US House represented its past legislation to provide $10.8 billion to the Highway Trust Fund and extend the provisions of MAP-21 through May 31, 2015. The Senate is expected to address highway legislation before the August recess and President is already on record in favor of the bill.","We believe these are first steps toward the full reauthorization of a new multi-year federal highway bill. Geographically, growth in aggregate\u2019s product line shipments was led by the west group which increased 22% of the prior year quarter. Encouragingly, the southeast and mid-America groups achieved improvement of 7% and 5% respectively.","Recovery is accelerating in the east, particularly in North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all fueled by strong employment numbers. We continue to believe this growth pattern will be experienced on a more widespread basis in the eastern United States.","We were pleased to achieve aggregate\u2019s product line pricing increases in each geographic group which led to an overall increase of 5% over prior year quarter. The growth was led by a 10% increase in the southeast group, which benefited from both improved and improving market conditions.","We recently implemented mid-year price increases in many areas across the business and are also reaffirming our annual pricing guides. Aggregate\u2019s product line production increased 10% in response to higher demand. Greater operating leverage led to a 5% reduction in cost per ton in both the west and southeast groups.","Production cost for the Mid-America group was hampered by challenging weather conditions in the Midwest, that\u2019s illustrated by Iowa\u2019s third wettest June in 141 years. Midwest operations battled the elements through much of the quarter and experienced correspondingly higher repair costs. So, direct aggregate\u2019s product line production cost per ton decreased slightly compared with the prior quarter.","Finally, consolidated cost of sales were adversely affected by over $13 million when compared with the prior year quarter due to the impact of changes in inventory levels. In the second quarter of 2014, we reduced finished goods by 1 million tons. On a comparison, in the second quarter of 2013, we built over 2 million tons of inventories.","Our vertically integrated operations consisting of asphalt concrete and road paving, each achieved sales growth over the prior year quarter. Notably, the ready mix concrete product line improved 48% reflecting both pricing and volume growth. On a combined basis, gross profit for these businesses increased more than $5 million over the prior year quarter.","Overall, the aggregate\u2019s business leveraged 20% increase in net sales into a 170 basis point expansion of gross margin to 20.7%. Notably, the Mid-Atlantic and Mideast divisions achieved an incremental gross margin consistent with our publicly stated expectations.","The specialty products business again generated quarterly records for net sales and earnings from operations. Net sales were $61.9 million, an increase of 9%, primarily driven by growth in the chemicals product line. The business reported a gross margin of nearly 38%, which is up slightly versus the prior year quarter.","As expected, consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 6.1%, a decline of 140 basis points. The reduction reflects lower pension expenses and the absence of information systems upgrade costs that were incurred in 2013.","As previously mentioned, we\u2019ve closed the TXI acquisition earlier this month by issuing 20.3 million shares of common stock. I want to publicly welcome our new members from TXI and look forward to their contributions to our company and shareholders.","I\u2019d be remised though not to acknowledge and thank all of our employees for their extraordinary work in connection with this transaction as well as the integration of TXI to our southwest division managed by Larry Roberts and now headquartered in Dallas.","The collaborative teamwork that was exhibited throughout this transaction and at every level of the organization enabled us to move forward smoothly and greatly enhanced with our aggregates and ready mix concrete positions by adding operations in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.","We also acquired three cement manufacturing plants and several distribution terminals in Texas and California. Our cement business also headquartered in Dallas represents a separate operating segment for our company and is managed by newly hired division President, Bob Kidnew who joins us with more than 20 years of cement industry experience.","We are pleased that our internal day one operating targets from that and our teams are working hard on integration and synergy realization. We expect annual synergies of $70 million by 2017.","We recently issued $700 million of senior notes, consisting of $400 million of 4.25% ten-year senior notes and $300 million of three year variables rate senior notes. The proceeds along with available cash and incremental borrowings under in the trade accounts receivable facility were used to refinance the public debt we assumed from TXI, which carried an annual interest rate of 9.25%.","Based on current interest rates, we expect to save $34 million of interest expense as a result of the refinancing. We also expect to realize additional value from TXI through the sale of non-operating real estate. TXI also provided more than $400 million of net operating loss carry-forwards as of May 31, 2013. We expect to utilize these NOLs as well as NOLs generated during fiscal 2014 over the next few years.","Overall, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per diluted share this year excluding one-time costs as well as cash flow in the first full year following integration. Shortly before the closing of the transaction, we announced an agreement with the United States Department of Justice under which we would divest our North Troy quarry in Oklahoma and two rail yards, one in Dallas and the other in Frisco Texas.","This agreement resolves all competition issues with respect to the TXI acquisition. As of the acquisition gain our market capitalization is nearly $9 billion. Further, Standard & Poor\u2019s Dow Jones Indices announced our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index.","We view this as an endorsement of our financial stability and prospects for future growth. We are delighted to welcome new shareholders index based investment funds add our common stock to their portfolio.","In anticipation of closing the TXI transaction, we incurred $5.3 million or $0.07 per share of acquisition and integration-related costs during the second quarter. For the quarter, earnings from operations were $96.2 million. Excluding TXI related costs, adjusted earnings from operations were $101.5 million, an improvement of more than 30% over the prior year quarter.","On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $70 million of operating cash flow, 45% improvement over the prior year period. This increase is directly tied to our earnings growth.","We remain in compliance with our leverage covenants and in that regard, our consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio was 2.5 times at June 30, within our targeted leverage range.","We recently modified the leverage covenant to exclude one-time acquisition and integration costs during the next 12 months. We also increased our trade receivables by $100 million. As amended, the facility has maximum borrowings of $250 million subject to the level of receivables.","Looking at the balance of the year, please note that our forward guidance excludes the impact of TXI operations. As mentioned earlier, we fully expect the acquisition to meet the financial and strategic goals we set.","We will provide you with more specific information about the impact of these new operations and their benefits to our results on our third quarter earnings call and we\u2019ve had a full quarter of that business under our belt.","As to the guidance, we are continuing to see the positive impact from a macro perspective. Moreover, the favorable trends in our business and markets especially growth in employment in general construction activity augur well for increased revenues and profits rise.","The Dodge Momentum Index continues to forecast growth in non-residential construction and we expect further growth in both the heavy industrial and commercial sectors. Shale developments in related following public and private construction activities are anticipated to remain strong.","Furthermore, the commercial building sector should benefit from improved market fundamentals including higher occupancies and rents, strengthened property values and increased real estate lending.","Based on these factors, we anticipate non-residential end-use shipments to increase in the high single-digits. Residential construction should continue to grow in our primary markets driven by rising employment near historically low mortgage rates and pent-up demand.","For the first time since 2007, total annual housing starts are anticipated to exceed 1 million units. We believe this trend will lead to double-digit volume growth in residential end-use shipments. For the public sector, authorized highway funding from MAP-21 will increase slightly compared with 2013.","Furthermore, state initiatives to finance infrastructure projects are expected to grow and continue to play a more role in public sector activity. Based on these trends and expectations we anticipate aggregate shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to increase slightly.","Finally, our Chemrock and Rail end-use market is expected to have mid to high single-digit growth compared with the prior year. As previously mentioned, we increased our volume guidance and now expect aggregate\u2019s product line shipments to increase 6% to 8% compared to 2013.","Our outlook assumes that Congress approves measures to provide federal highway funding beyond the expiration of MAP-21 in September and an additional revenue source for the Highway Trust Fund.","We also expect aggregate\u2019s product line pricing to increase 3% to 5% over 2013. Aggregate\u2019s product line direct production cost per ton is expected to decrease slightly compared with 2013. Our vertically integrated businesses should generate between $385 million and $405 million of net sales and $40 million to $45 million of gross profit.","Net sales from the specialty product segment should range from $225 million to $235 million generating $85 million to $90 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas remains two key drivers for this business.","SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline compared with 2013, driven in part by nearly $8 million of non-recurring costs incurred in 2013 primarily related to the information systems upgrade, as well as lower pension costs in 2014.","Interest expense should remain consistent with 2013. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 29% excluding discrete events and capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million.","To conclude, we are excited about our business and how it\u2019s positioned. Important key drivers for us are getting better. We expect to see further stability in the public sector which combined with continuing growth in private construction provides a great opportunity for us to continue our margin and profitability improvement.","In addition, the timely acquisition of TXI enhances our ability to leverage and grow the dynamic western markets. As we look ahead, we remain focused on completing the integration of the acquired operation, capturing synergies and creating additional shareholder value.","Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we will turn our attention to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your question please.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. And first focusing on the public end-markets, are you seeing any DOT slowing down in light of the uncertainty and do you see \u2013 we have not seen that based on our industry work with DOTs. But first, we\u2019d like to see, what you are seeing on your add and then also if you could clarify what states are accepting more responsibility for funding versus relying fully on Federal? Thank you.","Howard Nye","Kathryn, interesting question, short answer is we are not seeing state slowdown, we are hearing states talk about slowing down. So, our take is \u2013 the talk is more prevalent right now than the action is. This issue may recall states like Colorado earlier in the year came out and definitively said that they would move more slowly on public works.","We haven\u2019t necessarily seen that but in some instances, where we have seen edges of that. What\u2019s happened is private work has been so robust. It\u2019s pushing up public working to 2015 is actually something that we would welcome. So, that\u2019s the primary take that we are seeing, but as we look at the states in which we are most active Texas, Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, we don\u2019t see it.","Obviously, public works in Georgia has been under some degree \u2013 over the last several years period and if you look at what\u2019s going on there, Kathryn, the city of projects in Georgia right now in the northwest parkway is this large, is the Georgia DOT budgeted.","So coming back and answering the other part of your question, states like Georgia, North Carolina, soon is what we believe is kind of the I77 hot lane, Florida with I4, Colorado on Highway 36. Obviously, a lot of Texas C3 work right now. Those are the states that we are principally seeing that type of public private partnerships.","We see a lot of those projects going now and believe that they will turn actually into same year projects in the foremost time. But that\u2019s what we are seeing and I hope that\u2019s responsive to your question.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Sure, it is. Moving over to price, last quarter, discussed having a mix impact of pricing. This quarter, put up 5% pricing which was ahead of expectations. Can you discuss the dynamic of mix and to pricing in Q2 and how we should think about that over the next nine to 12 months?","Howard Nye","So, when we look at Q1, several things we really have, you saw a geographic shift to the west and you are seeing more base activity particularly in markets like Houston. That was the primary shift that we are seeing. I think you saw that shift aside from the volume, I mean, obviously you had much more volume in the last \u2013 at 22% top in the west. I mean, that\u2019s a notable number.","So I think you had to take that into account. But from a pure mix perspective on product mix, we didn\u2019t see that much of a shift or something that I would say is notable with one exception and that\u2019s in Colorado, because we are selling a lot of fill materials in that market as they come nearly 9%.","So Kathryn what we are seeing across the front is good solid steady price increases and of course I mentioned in our commentary as well that we saw a good number of mid-year price increase.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","And what\u2019s the driver for the greater rate of increase in base stone versus clean stone pricing?","Howard Nye","I think several things, I think you are just seeing more new work and I think you are seeing more new work in two different dimensions. So I think you are seeing more new work in some divisions. You are seeing more new work in commercial construction and you are seeing more new work in these T-type projects going forward. So I think simply that\u2019s product that\u2019s more in demand and demand tends to drive product type. So think that\u2019s primarily what we are seeing Kathryn.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","And final question, what are the markets where you are pushing through amid your price increase?","Howard Nye","And what \u2013 as we look at mid-years, this year I am happy to report that we are seeing mid-year price increases in all divisions including specialty products. We actually saw wider slots as mid-year price increases this year and sure a number of them we saw last year.","The blend goes anywhere from a low of up $0.30 a ton up to \u2013 in some instances to $2 a ton in aggregate, we\u2019ve seen changes of $5 to $10 for cubic yard and ready mix. And of course, I mentioned in our commentary that we will talk more about TXI \u2013 our build per quarter",". One thing we had to add under our belt is the ability to go and put in a cement price increase in both Texas and California and we will look for $10 a ton in both of those markets effective October 1.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Right, thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Kath.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your question please.","Lee Jagoda \u2013 CJS Securities","It\u2019s actually Lee Jagoda for Arnie. Good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hi, Lee.","Lee Jagoda \u2013 CJS Securities","Ward, can you expand a little bit on the $13 million negative impact of profitability from selling product out of the \u2013 where there any segments in particular or any product line have been impacting more than others?","Howard Nye","And I mean the, the quick answer is, during the quarter, we reduced aggregate\u2019s finished goods by million times and what you do when you do that is you effectively release the related capitalized costs into earnings. So as operations principally in our west and southeast groups use the inventory stockpiles to meet demand.","The action we saw happened that was pulled down. Now as a reminder, during the second quarter of last year, we build over 2 million tons of inventories and again that was primarily the west group. So when you have that type of swing in inventories, what we saw at the end of the day was consolidated cost of sales were adversely affected by a little bit north of $13 million. That was the swing.","Lee Jagoda \u2013 CJS Securities","Okay, and then just as a follow-up, could you modify the impact of the higher maintenance and repair costs in the quarter and maybe discuss some of the factors that led to the increased expense?","Howard Nye","Sure, and here is the way I would think about that, Lee. If we look at maintenance and repair and the part of our company that has seen volumes going well for a while and let\u2019s focus on the west group, because that\u2019s where our volume recovery has been more constant.","Our MNR numbers in the west group are actually favorable. Now what\u2019s happening is we are seeing our \u2013 it\u2019s not horribly robust but we are seeing volume go up in both the southeast and in mid-America. So again, mid-America, 5.1, southeast up 7.3. What happens when you see that for the first time in a while is basically you are re-commissioning rolling style.","And you are going to have certain costs as you re-commission it and then push it forward for some period of time and hopefully you won\u2019t see that cost recur. So as we come back and look at that, clearly, we saw a rise in that in portions of the southeast and in portions of mid-America as volume then grew.","It tended to be focused really on rolling stock, so primarily loaders, and I think that\u2019s the primary issue. The other thing that I did mentioned in my commentary, I think it probably did us to the tune of a couple of million bucks was purely what was happening with some of the costs that were inherent and the weather that we were seeing in the mid-western United States.","A lot of wind, some conveyor damage that came from that literally soft ball sized in part of that, and as I mentioned, one of the wettest Junes and in nearly 150 years. So, that does have an effect particularly when you are entering Q2 as we were.","Lee Jagoda \u2013 CJS Securities","Okay, thanks very much.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Lee.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack F. Kasprzak from BB&T. Your question please.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013BB&T Capital Markets","So, good afternoon, Ward.","Howard Nye","Hi Jack.","","Jack Kasprzak \u2013BB&T Capital Markets","Congrats on a good quarter. Relative to residential commentary which is strong for you guys in the quarter. However, housing starts lately have flattened out in particular in the east, basically flat in the second quarter.","Should that not give us a little cause for concern with regard to housing activity in general and what we might do for your volumes in the back half of the year not in the south is a key market for you guys. Or are you guys seeing something different that might give you more optimism than what\u2019s represented in the macro numbers right now?","","Howard Nye","Right, I think, Jack we have said it. I think we are in a time and you\u2019ve heard us say it over the last, really a year that where you are today matters more than it has than any other time in our industry and such that you pause and look at housing in our markets right now, some of the numbers that I have seen, these are percentage changes over the last 12 months.","North Georgia, clearly a market that has suffered disproportionately up 27%. San Antonio, a market that\u2019s seen a lot of growth over the last several years still up 27%, Virginia up 26%, Florida, up 23%, parts of North Carolina, up 21%, Greensborough, the Triad has really had a tough time in this downturn, those numbers were up 12% and even if I go to a market like Houston that we would have told you a year ago it was not an recovery.","But was an expansion even during that period of time that\u2019s been an expansion. We are seeing numbers there up 11% right now. And I think part of what\u2019s happening is you are seeing two things to in residential right now. You continue to see good multi-family. So we are writing around here in Raleigh anecdotally what\u2019s going on. I am going to see a lot more multi-family in this market and I am going to see single-family in this market.","But what that tells me is the single-family is likely coming behind that, Jack. So, I think as we look at our individual markets, I am not particularly alarmed by the more macro trends. So I think it\u2019s about where you are.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, great. And second question is, within your non-res segment, how much of your volume is related to oil and gas activity, shale activity?","Howard Nye","And what if you want to go back and take a look, obviously, non-res for us last year was around 30% and if we look at what non-res was for the quarter, again, it\u2019s lining up in a pretty healthy place. It was about 31% for the quarter. If we look at shale for all of last year, Jack, shale for last year was around 6.7 million tons and as we look at where we are this year, we see shale being healthier in 2014 than it was in 2013.","For example, we are expecting annual growth in the Niobrara by itself of 10% to 15% and we continue to see good strength in Eagle ford. And surprising strength right now in Haynesville and I guess the one that continues to surprise me, we saw over 1 million tons last year simply going to the Marcellus. So that gives you a rack up of what\u2019s going on in those shale plays is how that fits into the overall non-res.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, great. That does it for me. Thanks.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Jack.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Hi, good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Can you please talk about out of the P3 projects that you alluded to, what proportion of your infrastructure business would you estimate that\u2019s today and presumably your visibility is reasonably good on those projects going forward. I am wondering if you have a rough sense of how significant part of your infrastructure volumes that could be a year from now based on the projects?","Howard Nye","Well, Jerry, I think that can be a more considerable portion next year. If we look at what\u2019s out there right now and markets that matter to us. In Georgia\u2019s northwest corridor, in Texas, Grand Parkway has took your money, in California they are going to be a few that\u2019s going forward, I think we should have some impact on.","But if we look at what the likely next round of approvals is going to be, that\u2019s much more meaningful to us. So in Texas, interstate 35 is in queue and North Carolina I-77 is. In Ohio, it\u2019s 5 \u2013 in Florida we know I4 ultimate is going forward, but it\u2019s going to get $50.","So those are the ones that we think will stay in the next round of approvals. Even beyond that if we pause and take a look at what I think is in the queue but we are uncertain on the level of timing, there are couple of projects in Florida, really in the Tampa corridor. If you combine those two, you\u2019ve still got the mid- Mid-Currituck Bridge in North Carolina.","That's a $611 million project. And then by my last count, there were at least five other projects, state highway 288, 183, and Padre Island, and route 4 \u2013 I am sorry, those four in Texas and then two more in Virginia. So as we tally up what the work is that we think is, A, likely next round. We think those are pretty big and impactful projects to us and then when we look at the ones that have a more uncertain future timing.","We think those two can be impact to us given the fact that much of it disproportionate number of it is either in Florida where we are the infrastructure people in Texas where we are a market leader.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Any chance you have the total project value out of the ones that you think are likely to move forward in those markets?","Howard Nye","You know what, okay. If we look at I35 east and Texas at $1.4 billion, I77 in North Carolina, the 50 is funding is over $0.5 billion the bridge and I mean the bypass in Ohio was $819 million and I4, again the TIFIA funding, $2.7 billion.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","Thank you for sharing that and I am wondering, on the TXI cement business, you were kind enough to talk about the price increase announcements you've laid out. I'm wondering if you could update us on what the realized cement pricing was for the business in July or in calendar 2Q, if you're willing to share that?","Howard Nye","Here is the way that we are going to approach that Jerry and part of what I think I need to explain is like a process works when you are in a DOJ governed transaction like this, because part of what we recognize is until we had DOJ approval to close this deal, we couldn\u2019t be certain that they was going to go.","We felt confident that would but you can\u2019t ever bid on. So what we never said, take our local management and put them in that business. We had people here at our headquarters looking at that. But Larry Robert, I mentioned Bob Kidnew in particular who is riding our Cement business has literally had 30 days of hands on time in that business.","So what we are focused on right now is recognizing that the TXI Martin Marietta business that\u2019s combined together going forward is a very different business and the TXI was the ruling here. And the management team that was there and responsible for that business is in large part not a part of the business going forward.","So what we are going to do is really get this under our belt, come back and talk you about it the next earnings call. But what I\u2019ll tell you is this, we have found nothing in our integration activities. We have done nothing in anything that we\u2019ve done that has in any way diminished. How good we feel about this transaction and we feel very, very confident and comfortable that the numbers and strategies that we\u2019ve laid out are very achievable.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then if I could ask on the inventory de-stock, is there any additional room to go? Or was this the biggest chunk we saw this quarter? We'll talk about that a little bit more in the third quarter?","","Howard Nye","We will talk about that a little bit more in the third quarter. I mean, part of what we said for a while is particularly on base products, again, I don't think this is Martin Marietta issue, I think it's an industry issue.","As the industry was going through the downturn and we were having to play more for clean washed stone, because that's what a lot of the stimulus work was and otherwise. People were genuinely building base. And then part of the earlier questions we had is, why are we seeing base pricing going up. Part of what we are seeing is more base activity out there.","So again, it is not something that I lament. I think being able to go and rebalance the inventories is actually a very responsible and appropriate thing for us to do. And in some respects, Jerry, I hope we are faced with that problem. And I put problem in quotation marks.","Anne Lloyd","Jerry, it\u2019s Anne and I would say that, possibly you could see some in Q3. Now if volumes continue to be as strong as they were in the second quarter, we could likely begin to see some inventory build as we hit the last part of the year to get ready for a strong construction season in 2015. But again, we will see that as we move through the balance of the quarter and complete our planning for 2015.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, and then lastly, if I could, on the capital deployment side, now that the TXI deal has closed, can you calibrate us on how you're thinking about capital deployment going forward in terms of buyback versus acquisitions? How does each path look to you?","And I appreciate it might be a couple of quarters before you are willing to put capital to work after closing that transaction. But I would appreciate you giving us an update on your framework. Thank you.","Anne Lloyd","Okay. Thank you, Jerry. That\u2019s a great question. I think one of the beauties of this transaction is it droves off tremendous amounts of cash and that as we\u2019ve said, we thought we would be cash flow accretive within the year after the transaction was complete.","So that will give us the opportunity to continue to look at capital deployment strategies. As always, we look at the strategy that the opportunities present themselves. But, it\u2019s always looking at acquisitions to see in those places where we can continue to execute against our strategic plan to gain leading market positions across the US. Obviously, we have some organic capital needs.","We\u2019ve estimated about $50 million this year for TXI on top of the capital deployment that will do here and then we do have an outstanding authorization for share buyback. Then we firmly believe that a share buyback plan is an important part of the capital allocation strategy as we continue to get \u2013 build out the cash transaction.","We have committed to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and I think that\u2019s important to our public debt holders and these things will have plenty of opportunity there.","","Howard Nye","And Jerry as a reminder, we do have an authorization as Anne said to repurchase up to 5 million shares. So, just as a reminder that is there.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you.","Howard Nye","","Thank you, Jerry.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Olin from Cleveland Research Company. Your question please.","Chris Olin \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Hey, good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hi, Chris.","Chris Olin \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Just wanted to ask on transportation. There has been some talk that either cement or aggregate volumes had been running a little bit softer because people couldn't get the rail or trucking necessary. I am wondering if that impacted you all during the quarter and will it have any type of impact in the next quarter or so?","Howard Nye","The short answer, I think it is impacting some of the industry or much of the industry now, particularly with respect to trucking. And I think as you get into areas where there is a great deal of shale activity. So if you are looking at parts of Niobrara, or you are looking at parts of South Texas where there is some lot of trucking that\u2019s been utilized in those shale plays and by the way pretty well paid trucking activities, it\u2019s hard at times to get the truck.","So, I think, when you factor that out realistically, it is a challenge in some markets. It\u2019s not a challenge in all of them. But if we look at trucking today versus where trucking was a year ago, it is a more difficult component today. The rail business is spotty.","I mean, there are going to be some places that you are going to see services to actually going to go very well. There are going to be others and service is going to be more challenged.","I wish I could tell you there was a \u2013 that did to the way that that works, I don\u2019t know that there is, in fact I am relatively confident that there is not. So, Chris, if I am sitting for you are, I would factor a little bit of trucking difficulties into these markets. Some of them, but I think not just for this year, that\u2019s probably a multi-year issue that the industry has to be sensitive to in playing around.","Anne Lloyd","What we do see, Chris, thought is, historically as activity picks up and demand picks up, rail shortage, rail movement shortage is not uncommon. I\u2019ve kind of take it as a good sign that economic recovery is expanding beyond just the construction materials business, while that real shortage can create challenges and also creates opportunities, because we\u2019ve got a nice rail network that we can leverage and it also gives you the opportunity to realize the value of the products that you are moving.","Chris Olin \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Okay, that's all I had. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your question please","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Good afternoon, Anne and Ward.","Howard Nye","Hi, Trey.","Anne Lloyd","Hi.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Can you \u2013 I appreciate some of the color you\u2019ve given us on the mid-year or I guess the fall price increase for cement, $10 a ton for California and then also Texas. But how do we think about the rollout there, and how it impacts the overall cement pricing, as far as timing?","","Howard Nye","I think, it\u2019s price matter. I think the timing is going to be relatively immediate. I mean, that there is going to be some protection that is going to be in various markets, but at the same time, I think one of the reasons that we are talking thus far in advances to let people know this is coming.","And part of what we have been very focused on is making sure that we are running that new TXI business absolutely sufficiently as we can and I think what this is indicative of is, we see a very good market in both Texas and California not measured by a period of months, and I think in particular measured by a period of years and I think we have an opportunity to make sure we are capturing value in that product.","Anne Lloyd","And Trey, we had indicated in earlier comment, as we rolled out all the public \u2013 required public disclosures of the TXI transaction that, about a third of TXI\u2019s existing volume was covered under some form of longer term agreements. Those should be substantially gone by the end of this calendar year.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Okay, great. That's real helpful","Howard Nye","Okay, yep.","","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","And then one last question, looking at, and I know it\u2019s early in the process, but I think there TXI's \u2013 excuse me, Midlothian plant had the opportunity or the permitting, however you want to talk about it, to expand by about 800,000 tons.","And given the tightness that's in the market now, I mean, at what point does it make sense to start thinking about that expansion, and then on that as well, how long would the process be, if you decided to green light it hypothetically tomorrow, how quickly could that capacity come on?","Howard Nye","Trey, exactly it\u2019s something that we would talk to more with you about going forward and I think the primary thing that we are focused on is making sure that we are making money. I mean, that\u2019s what that game is about, that\u2019s what we are going to do and that\u2019s what the focus is going to me and Bob Kidnew and his team understand that very well.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","That's fair enough. And then, on concrete, very strong pricing and volume. Can you talk about the markets you're seeing there? Which geographic markets you're really seeing the strength there, both from a volume and pricing standpoint?","Howard Nye","I mean, most of the volume and price strength that we are seeing right now is really more driven and what we are seeing in our Colorado operations and I think if we are looking at what\u2019s going on there, pricing has moved very, very nicely.","Volume equally has moved well in that market. Again, the housing market is performing, the non-residential market is performing. Keep in mind, that\u2019s going to be disproportionately driven in some instances, particularly in Rocky Mounts by private work anyway. So that is it need to be solid for us.","We continue to feel like that\u2019s going to be very good and we believe that, if we are looking what\u2019s going on in the Dallas Fort Worth area, is particular right now, I mean there is just an immense amount of infrastructure work that\u2019s going on in DFW. If you look at what\u2019s going in with respect to single-family homes that got the lowest foreclosure rates in Dallas today that they had in 10 years.","Sales were up 7% in June with over 9000 sold. That was really an all time high. So as we are seeing that type of massive infrastructure work that\u2019s underway in that market. When we are seeing more and more commercial work, I mean to give you a sense of it right now, there is about 4.3 million square feet of construction underway just in Dallas. So we are seeing that in non-res.","We are seeing that in res and then we are coming back and seeing, I 35 east, 635 state highway 184, lot of Dallas Area Rapid Transit or the DART work in that market as well. I think that bodes awfully well for what the ready mix business can look like in DSW and that\u2019s the other big market that we have post TXI.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc.","That's very encouraging. Thanks a lot, guys and congrats on a good quarter.","Howard Nye","Trey, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your question please","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","To follow up on the maintenance and rolling stock expenses you had in the quarter, just how we should think about that, moving forward, as demand improves. Should these be gradual expenses that we layer in, presumably as the cycle rebounds or will they be more as step function increases to get your rolling stock and capacity where it needs to be?","Howard Nye","Garik , as we go back in time and look at cycles, the latter is what\u2019s almost always been. It\u2019s almost been a step-function increase and then you go ahead and address the issues and then it evens out and you move forward. And I think, and so we saw it during the quarter.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thanks. And just shifting to pricing for a second. Just in the southeast group, if we can dig in there, double-digit price increases, how much of that was mix versus \u2013 this will be a like-for-like price increase?","Howard Nye","Well, you know what, that\u2019s an easy one to say because mix was actually not our friend. In the southeast this quarter, we are going better that notion that you see a lot of new construction there. So actually everything that you see in that number is the real McCoy.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, well, okay. So, I guess, just lastly, just two questions on TXI. Can you just update us with respect to where you are in the divestment process of the North Troy quarry and the rail yards?","Howard Nye","No absolutely \u2013 thanks for the question on that. As you know, that the assets that would divest as part of the transaction are actually heritage Martin Marietta assets which means from a timing perspective we recognize going in and that was likely to be the result. So, we were in a position to go ahead and start looking at options with respect to those sites earlier as opposed to layer, because they weren\u2019t TXI sites.","They were our own. So we can have the conversation. Our aim is this Garik, we are mature in that process. We believe it\u2019s moving in a very constructive fashion right now and if we are still talking about a process at the next quarterly call, I\u2019ll be disappointed. I think, we will have that done before you and I have a conversation like this again.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay that makes sense. Is it fair to assume that you're going to keep the North Troy results within the third quarter operations within the legacy business? Or is that going to be stripped out as a one-time?","Howard Nye","I mean, what we are doing is, we do have a whole separate quarter. So we are looking at North Troy separately from the rest of our business, but if you go back to what I\u2019ve said about our teams and the fact that we had to operate in a very bifurcated fashion going through the diligence, we are having to do the same thing with North Troy right now. So, you understand it Garik.","Anne Lloyd","","But they are in our legacy operations, Garik.","","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, yes, that's what I was getting at. And then just lastly, you previously identified $70 million of operational synergies with the TXI deal. Now that it's closed, wondering, you only have a month in there. But I was wondering if you can provide any guidance if you could, at this point on any revenue synergy opportunities that you may have identified?","Howard Nye","You know what, obviously, we are looking at trying to finish up really a lot of just a pure integration right now, Garik. I\u2019ll tell you, there is not a component of this business. That has been a surprise to us. There is nothing that has been a negative headwind.","Obviously, I think we can come back and talk about what we think next year is going to look like, what pricing is going to look like and a host of markets including the FW at some point later in the year and I think that\u2019s probably the best thing for us to do right now.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks so much.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Garik.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question please","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Hello, Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Anne and Ward, I was hoping to dig into the inventory dynamics a little more. I know you said you'll talk more about it in the third quarter. But just, as it relates to calibrating our models and expectations, could you just walk through at least as it pertains to 3Q and maybe 4Q.","How you would expect to either draw from inventories or build? I think you made the comment that you may draw in the third quarter and build in the 4Q. As a starting point, did I hear that correctly?","","Anne Lloyd","Yes, you did, Ted, but, I am not going to walk through those dynamics, because that would in some ways \u2013 having us give quarterly volume guidance which we don\u2019t to. I was just giving you a macro direction as to what I would infer that could potentially happen just based on the seasonality of the business and expectations for thinking about demand in 2015.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Absolutely understood and appreciated. And I guess the challenge we have is a year ago you over-produced, but didn't call it out. So now a year later when you have the reversal, it\u2019s just hard to figure out how we should normalize for this dynamic. So guess, may be ask a little differently, could you just walk through where your inventories are now on the tons basis and where you exited 2Q, compared to 1Q and a year ago?","Howard Nye","","Go ahead.","","Anne Lloyd","If you look at inventory today for the aggregates business, we are about 54 million tons as of June 30 and last year we are about 65.4 million tons.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay and 1Q, if you don't mind.","Anne Lloyd","I apologize, Ted, I don\u2019t have 1Q in front of me. I usually look at in a quarter based on what\u2019s going on from the 12\/31 perspective.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Sure.","Anne Lloyd","","That I\u2019ll be happy to, we can answer that for you offline.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And then just maybe again and this will be the last thing I will ask and we can go through it offline. But, in terms of how to think about what you target either as a percent of LPM or forward 12 months or annualized quarterly volumes, what do you target in terms of running the business? And where are we relative to kind of the peak and trough in absolutely inventories?","Howard Nye","The aim is four to six turns per year, Ted, I mean, that\u2019s where we would like to be. It\u2019s clearly that\u2019s the more normalized process that you should expect from us.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And we're right now, like two turns?","Anne Lloyd","","In some areas, you are getting into that four range, but you are in that probably two to three turns, yes.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to ask about, I know you mentioned aggregate pricing increases ranging from $0.30 to $2.00 a ton and do you have an average that you put through at the mid-year?","Howard Nye","You know what, every market is different, Ted, and it may move within a 50 mile radius. So that we did not, we deal as we are honest with each market, very much on an individual basis.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","But you don't have a bottoms-up consolidated average?","Howard Nye","No, we don\u2019t, not right now. Not that we want to talk about.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And just \u2013 I think you said it was up in, was it most markets or all markets?","","Howard Nye","","I mean, what I said was up in all divisions and it was up in more areas this year than it was last year and when I said all divisions, I also meant specialty products.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay could you \u2013 and the last thing I'll ask, could quantify when you say more areas this year than last, what those numbers are?","Howard Nye","","Last year, we said it was \u2013 from a division it\u2019s all up, last year we said it was going to be about half of our districts and this year it\u2019s comfortably more than half of our districts.","","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay, great. I'll get back in line. Thanks guys. Good luck this quarter.","Howard Nye","Thanks, Ted.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your question please.","Stanley Elliott \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you for fitting me in here. Real quick, so when we think about the NOLs, a few years, is there a way to get a little bit better handle on how the pacing of the NOLs will be on a go-forward basis?","Howard Nye","","I\u2019ll let Anne, talk NOLs.","","Anne Lloyd","","Yes, Stanley, we have indicated that we thought we would realize those NOLs over about a two to three year period. And from a pacing perspective, it\u2019s going to depend on the earnings dynamic. Of course, we\u2019ve not provided any \u2013 well.","And I can tell you, if you think about TXI\u2019s legal entities for those fiscal year, the short period and for the calendar year, you are probably going to actually increase the NOLs this year. You think about the one-time costs related to the transaction et cetera that I\u2019ll get \u2013 have deductibility. So, I think the pacing of those really begins to pick up in 2015 and probably realizes over a three year period.","","Stanley Elliott \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, and then, I apologize if I missed it, you talked about the North Troy assets, but what about some of the other assets that TXI had that were up for potential divestiture, kind of the non-core? Have you started making any progress with those and any color there would be helpful?","Howard Nye","What we had said, we felt there was probably about $100 million worth of excess property there. We continue to feel very comfortable around that number. It is something that we are focused on. I don\u2019t want to give you a precise timing on when that will go because real estate are real estate deals. But again, we feel like comfortable within a couple of years we would have dealt with that.","","Stanley Elliott \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Perfect. Well, thanks very much and best of luck.","Howard Nye","All right, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s program. I\u2019d like to hand the program back to Mr. Nye for any further remarks.","Howard Nye","Thanks again for joining our second quarter earnings call and for your interest in our company. And as you know, we are committed to a very disciplined approach and our aim is to grow long-term shareholder value and we look forward to talking more about our heritage business and our new business with you when we meet next in October.

Q4 2012 and Full-Year Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ward Nye, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Howard Nye","Good afternoon and thank you for joining the Martin Marietta Materials quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019re pleased to report both our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results. Additionally, we\u2019ll provide observations into expectations for 2013.","As an initial reminder, this discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on the SEC\u2019s website. Any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings.","Finally, the corporation\u2019s 2012 consolidated operating results should be evaluated mindful of our December 2011 asset exchange transaction which provided us with an entry into the markets in and around Denver, Colorado. Where appropriate, we have provided analysis to highlight this impact.","We were pleased to finish 2012 the same way we started with growth in both heritage aggregates product line shipments and average selling price compared with the prior year quarter. Our quarterly heritage volume growth of 5% was attributable to improvement in infrastructure, non-residential and residential construction activity with notable strength in the latter two.","We also received another strong contribution from the specialty products business, which is operating at capacity and generated $15.8 million of operating earnings. On a consolidated basis, aggregates volume growth and the performance of the specialty products business were the significant drivers of quarterly earnings of $0.46 per diluted share. Earnings per diluted share included a $0.04 impact from restructuring initiatives completed during the quarter.","The non-residential and residential end-use markets each achieved 13% growth in heritage aggregates product line shipments compared with the prior year quarter. The non-residential market, our second largest end-use comprised 31% of quarterly shipments and had volume growth in both the energy and commercial construction sectors. The majority of energy sector shipments generates from our West Group which continued the benefit from ongoing oil and natural gas activity at the Eagle Ford Shale deposit in South Texas.","Growth in commercial construction, namely office and retail was evident in our Southeast and West Group\u2019s during the quarter. We believe commercial construction is beginning to benefit from sixth consecutive quarters of residential growth. Generally, expansion in the commercial component of non-residential construction usually lags 12 to 18 months behind the residential construction market.","The residential construction market itself is rebounding with a level of growth not seen since 2005. December\u2019s seasonally adjusted annual housing starts of 954,000, up 34% over prior year provide an encouraging sign for 2013 prospects. While the pace of residential recovery varies by market, strength was notable in our West Group, particularly in Texas and Colorado. The infrastructure in these market increased nearly 2% during the quarter representing around 49% of our quarterly heritage aggregates product line shipments. Importantly, infrastructure\u2019s contribution to our total shipment volume is moving more in line with historical averages; another indicator of an improving overall construction market.","As expected, we see tangible signs the infrastructure market is poised to benefit from various federal and state sponsored initiatives including the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21. For example, federal highway obligations, a leading indicator of highway construction activity increased 91% in the quarter ended December 31st when compared with the corresponding period of the prior year. While this rate of obligation improvement will no doubt moderate if nonetheless represents the highest level of obligations since fiscal 2010. This suggests increased highway award activity as the spring 2013 construction season begins.","We also continue to monitor applications for funding provided by the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act or TIFIA. Several of our key states including Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia have applied for TIFIA funds to support key infrastructure initiatives. Through January 4th, the U.S. Department of Transportation received applications for 27 projects with a cumulative value of more than $38 billion; over one-third of the dollar value of these projects is in Martin Marietta served markets. While TIFIA related construction projects could begin as early as the second half of this year, we believe the more meaningful impact will began in 2014.","We continue to be encouraged by various state initiatives designed to increase funding for infrastructure projects. As discussed in a February 6th, Wall Street Journal article, governors and legislatures across the country are increasingly coming to grips with the reality that their infrastructure problems have been compounded by decades of under funding and delay in construction and renovation of roads, bridges and other central infrastructure such as utilities.","Against that backdrop, the State of Colorado recently passed the Responsible Acceleration of Maintenance and Partnerships or Ramp program, potentially increasing infrastructure funding $1.5 billion over the next five years. Virginia\u2019s governor proposed transportation funding overhaul that could have provided an estimated $3 billion for highways, rail and transit systems in the next five years.","The plan was approved by the Virginia House of Delegates, but effectively tabled by the Senate sending the governor back to the drawing board for creative solutions to the State\u2019s transportation challenges. However, in news since our earnings release this morning, the Virginia State Senate Finance Committee has an amended version of the Transportation Funding Bill. If enacted, the Senate\u2019s proposal to generate an estimated $4.5 billion over the next five years. Like Virginia, Governor\u2019s across the United States are looking for answers to meet local transportation needs.","Not surprisingly though the State\u2019s with such initiatives in place are outpacing the nation in highway contract awards. For example, we are very encouraged by significant increase in Texas lettings, nearly $9 billion more than double prior year. Conversely, some States including South Carolina are experiencing budget constraints negatively affecting infrastructure commitments. The State of Indiana has also seen a decline in contract awards reflecting the waning impact of the state\u2019s multi-year major moves initiative. ","To complete the discussion of our end-use markets, heritage aggregates product line shipments to the ChemRock and Rail end-use was down 3% compared with the strong prior year quarter. Consistent with trends noted earlier in 2012, declines in both coal traffic on the railroads and track maintenance resulted in lower ballast shipments. This reduction was partially offset by increased agricultural lime shipments in our Midwest division triggered by an unseasonably warm and dry weather during the quarter. ","We achieved heritage aggregates product line shipment growth in each of our reportable groups. However, the rate of improvement varies geographically. Led by energy sector and residential growth in Texas, the West Group reported an 8.7% increase in heritage aggregates volumes over the prior year quarter. The Southeast Group had a 1.7% increase with notable infrastructure growth in Florida being partially offset by a reduction of shipments at our offshore operations. ","Finally, our Mideast Group generated a 1.2% increase in Heritage shipments. Strengths seen in the Charlotte, North Carolina market was largely offset by reductions in Virginia and West Virginia. Overall, we achieved a 1% increase in heritage aggregates product line average selling price led by 2.9% improvement in the Southeast Group. Pricing growth reflects both increases implemented during the year and the effects of product mix. ","Inclusive of acquisitions, our overall average selling price declined slightly reflecting the impact of our Denver based business. As a reminder, aggregates product line pricing at our Colorado operations is lower than our heritage business due to market maturity, product mix and the vertically integrated nature of everything market. ","In response to high demand, we increased heritage aggregates product line production by 6%. Despite an increase of $0.11 or 4% in the average paid per gallon of diesel fuel, our operations personnel maintained their focus on cost control and leveraged higher volumes to reduce heritage aggregates product line production costs per ton by 2%. ","Notably, this reduction reflects the 13% increase in productive efficiency as measured by tonnes produced for working man hour. We believe these trends demonstrate the potential for future cost synergies as shipment volumes continue to recover. ","The specialty products business generated quarterly net sales of $50.6 million, inclusive of $3 million generated by new kiln at the Woodville, Ohio facility which became operational on November 1. Effective cost management led to an operating margin of 31% for the quarter. ","For the full year, this business established new records with net sales of $202.2 million, gross profit of $77.2 million and earnings from operations of $68.5 million. Gross margin continues to reflect the increased impact of vertically integrated businesses. That is our ready mix concrete, hot mixed asphalt and related road paving businesses in Arkansas, Colorado and Texas. ","For the quarter, consolidated gross margin was 16.7%. Excluding the impact of vertical integration, consolidated gross margin would have been 19.4%, a 270 basis points increase over the reported metric.","As the percentage of net sales, our selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses improved 20 basis points to 8.3%. On an absolute basis, the $6.3 million SG&A increase reflects the threefold impact of a $3.3 million restructuring charge, $1.8 million of cost related to our planned information systems upgrade expected to be complete later this year and overhead at our Colorado operations.","As previously mentioned, organizational changes completed during the quarter to streamline our management structure in 2013 should reduce ongoing annual SG&A expenses by more than $3 million. Consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $40.1 million compared with $20.7 million in the prior year quarter.","Recall that 2011 quarterly earnings reflected $15 million of business development expenses. We continue to generate significant cash flow and for the year, cash provided by operating activities was $223 million. This sum includes a $38 million cash outlay for business development expenses and $23 million to fund working capital requirements at our Colorado operations. ","During the year, we made prudent capital investments of $151 million, reduced our outstanding debt by $12 million, contributed $33 million to our pension plans and maintained our dividend rate of $1.60 per common share.","At year end 2012, our ratio of consolidated debt-to-consolidated EBITDA was 3.21 times compliant with the limits under debt covenant. Our 2012 performance along with the positive trends we are seeing in our end-use markets suggest that our current momentum will continue in 2013. ","We expect more new construction activity in 2013 driven by MAP-21, TIFIA and other state sponsored programs. As a result, we expect shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to increase in the mid single-digits. The Architecture Billings Index or ABI a leading economic indicator of non-residential construction spending reflects the strongest growth in billings at architecture firms since the end of 2007. ","Accordingly, we anticipate non-residential end-use market growth in the high single-digits. Further, recovery in the residential end-use market is expected to continue and we anticipate double-digit growth in these shipments. ","Finally, we expect our ChemRock and Rail shipments to remain flat with 2012 levels. Cumulatively, we anticipate heritage aggregates product launch shipments to increase 4% to 6%. As a reminder, we experienced unusually moderate weather in the first five months of 2012 allowing an earlier than normal start to the construction season in many of our markets. ","If we experience more typical winter weather in 2013, our quarterly pattern of aggregates shipments and earnings may differ compared with 2012. In particular, 2013 first quarter results would be compared with a strong quarter in 2012. We currently expect heritage aggregates product line pricing will increase 2% to 4%, a variety of factors beyond our direct control may continue to exert pressure on our volumes and our forecasted pricing increase is not expected to be uniform across the company. We expect our vertically integrated businesses to generate between $350 million and $375 million of net sales and $20 million to $22 million of gross profit.","Increased production should generate operational efficiencies and lead to modest reduction in aggregates product line direct production cost per ton compared with 2012. Net sales for the specialty product segment should range from $220 million to $230 million generating $81 million to $85 million of gross profit.","Steel utilization and natural gas prices are two key drivers for the segment. SG&A expenses as percentage of net sales are expected to decline slightly. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively flat compared with 2012. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 26% excluding the discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million. ","To conclude, our team delivered solid performance during the year of erratic economic behavior and we are pleased with our 2012 results. Further, we look forward to building on current economic trends and external construction activity indicators pointing to increased activity in 2013.","With our well placed assets, disciplined cost structure and our team\u2019s track record of performance through the worst cyclical downturn in our industry\u2019s history, I believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities and enhance long-term shareholder value.","Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. The operator will now give the required instructions. We will turn our attention to address your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities.","Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities","My question relates to the west segment of your business which had very strong growth 8.7%, can you give us a better sense of a spread between Texas and Colorado and then I have some follow-up questions related to Texas.","Howard Nye","The primary growth would have been in the Texas group primarily in the southwest group. If we take a look at really what's driving much of that Arnie, construction in San Antonio was up remarkably, construction employment was up there 7% year-over-year. In 2012 they sold nearly 20,000 homes there, that was up 10% year-over-year. Eagle Ford volume all by itself for the quarter was up 33%. So these are the types of drivers that are really pushing that market pretty hard. We still anticipate even in 2013 to have around $28 billion of money flowing into the Eagle Ford. So we feel like the Eagle Ford was obviously very good in \u201912. We think it will continue to be good in \u201913. ","I can give you similar numbers also for Houston and DFW. But those are really the primary drivers that we are seeing Arnie. Now at the same time, what we are seeing in Colorado is actually a very attractive story as well, and keep in mind you've got a Colorado DOT that has a budget around $600 million and coming in with the ramp program which is $1.5 billion over the next five years. You are basically adding 50% to the Colorado DOT budget as we go into 2013. So what we are seeing in Texas relative to home building, what we are seeing in Texas relative to non-res particularly in energy, and what we are seeing there in infrastructure is good, and what we are seeing in Colorado with respect to infrastructure for ramp and what we are seeing going on with respect to home building is also very attractive.","Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities","My second question relates to a slide that you had in a conference that I think is pretty interesting particularly as we look out over the next two years and expect volume growth. In that chart you showed the four or five year impact of volume of in excess of $500 million on your EBITDA and its pretty interesting thinking of that number on the base of 329, which is where we ended last year. As we continue to ramp up volume over the next few years, given the structural changes in your business, how should we think about the EBITDA potential of your business in the next two years as volume improves. Obviously you won't get all 80 million tons back in two years, but how should we think about the incremental margin on the volume we are likely to get.","Howard Nye","I think you can think about it in several ways, number one, we talked about incremental margins and said what we thought it would be over the next 40 million tons, and we think that's going to be very, very powerful. That's simply getting back to your point Arnie about half of the volumes that we\u2019ve lost. Here's some of the takeaways to think about; our headcount is considerably lower today than it was at our peak profitability. Our efficiency as measured by tons produced per working man hour is higher today than it was at peak profitability; and our average selling price is around $2.51 a ton higher today than it was at peak profitability. ","So what that tells us is if we come back with a degree of volume that you are talking about, it will be remarkably powerful to this business. The other thing that I will tell you is, where that volume comes back is going to matter a lot. I mean clearly what we have seen this year is a very healthy at least on a relative basis Western United States and believe me we will take every bit of that. But the fact is we really need the eastern US to get healthy as well because that\u2019s a higher margin business for us.","Again we celebrate what's going on in the west, but when volume comes back, Arnie it\u2019s going to be powerful. When volume comes back in the east, it's going to be particularly powerful.","Anne Lloyd","And I will add to that Arnie, you can take the State of North Carolina. If you look at our top five states, Texas, North Carolina, Iowa. North Carolina needs to come back more healthfully.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","On the west pricing is up 1.3% and you know Denver pricing is on average lower versus your other core market. What would a pricing been excluding Denver and how are you doing in that market in terms of some of your efforts to push up pricing?","Howard Nye","Pricing again, total rolled up pricing ex-Denver was actually up 1% when you bring Denver in. It takes them the total picture down. So that does give you a sense Kathryn of how much lower pricing is in Denver relatively speaking. To answer your question on that though, we're looking at price increases across all product lines in Denver. Keep in mind you got a couple of issues in Denver relative to aggregates. Number one, it tends to be more of a standing gravel market as oppose to a crush stone market, although we do have a crush stone presence there. So we're looking to raise prices on both sand and gravel, as well as the crushed stone. But Denver is one of the few markets as you recall that we also have a vertically integrated footprint there and we are also going on with price increases on ready mix concrete and hot mix as well. Again, we've gone in to Denver and what we feel like is a leadership position, and we feel like that leadership position means coming to that market and demonstrating discipline around what we are going to do relative to production and also looking to add some value to the product as well.","","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","That\u2019s helpful. You also touched on seeing trades in the west market with energy, and we know that was going on in Texas. But you also talked a little bit about the Colorado. Could you clarify how much of this is driven by Bakken versus Niobrara or is it really too early for those Shale place for you to see any type volumes in the Colorado market?","","Howard Nye","What we will see increasing volumes in that Colorado market, I will tell you when we look at what shale volumes were for this year they were pretty close to 6 million tons and the biggest single slug of that was clearly coming out of the Eagle Ford. If I look at what was going on year-over-year, we clearly saw more activity in Niobrara in \u201812 then they would have seen in \u201811 and we anticipate more activity in Niobrara in \u201813 versus \u201912. We see shipments in the Barnett relatively even year-over-year going into \u201813 and we feel like the Eagle Ford again it\u2019s going to continue to be a very healthy place. ","Keep in mind there were notions that Eagle Ford was actually going to back off a little bit in \u201812 and they didn\u2019t. I think a lot of people feel like it may back off a little bit in \u201913. I am not sure that we are ready to say that with $38 billion of infrastructure and otherwise going into that. If we look year-over-year as well even what we are going to see in the Mississippian which is a new formation relatively speaking will be more year-over-year. The only place I am seeing a little bit of a pull back is probably going to be in the Haynesville deposit which again is moving from a gas deposit to more of a wet deposit as you go from Arkansas, Louisiana down to South Texas.","","Anne Lloyd","And Kathryn while we moved some material into the Bakken early in our entry into the energy sector, we really aren\u2019t getting much material in there, we are really concentrating on this other formation.","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","Okay, that is helpful, thank you. And my final question is really focused long gross margin then I will hop back in the queue. How should we think about gross margins particularly in the quarter in light, you had some nice volume increases and some pricing increase, how should we that you saw from year-over-year declines. Help us walk through, how we should think about quarter and how we should think about modeling going forward, thank you?","Howard Nye","Kathryn I think the primary weightage, we are going to have to think about that is we do simply have a largely vertically integrated component of our business that we\u2019ve had historically. So if you want to look back at Heritage on hot mix, Heritage we used to have around 1.5 million tons of hot mix. With Denver this year we added on additional 1.7 million tons of hot mix. Traditionally Heritage we would have had around 550,000 cubic yards of ready mix, with Denver we added in excess of 900,000 cubic yards. ","So as you look at that, it does change the mix of the business pretty considerably. Obviously if you take the vertically integrated component out, we indicated that the 270 basis point difference between 16.7% on the margin and the 19.4. The other thing I would mentioned to you, and it goes back to the comment that Anne, made a little while ago. If we look at the quarter for this year, we sold around $7 million tons of stone into southwest division. In same quarter last year, it was around $5.8 million tons the stone in the southwest division.","So again, while we welcome and celebrate the tonnage in the West, that tonnage is not going to have the margin that you see in the East so I would suggest to you there's a geographic mix issue relative to that, I would suggest to you that the vertically integrated component is a bit different. And the other thing that I would say to you is you need to take a look at what the product mix itself was as well. As we look at the product mix there are a number of different products that I see pretty healthy tonnage movement in; we sold more sand in this quarter than we did last year, we sold more fill material this quarter than we did prior year. So I think what we discussed before, the vertically integrated component, the geographic mix and the product mix are the issues that principally drove the difference in the gross margin.","Anne Lloyd","But Kathryn if you look at the 270 basis points impact on the fourth quarter margin that Ward laid out, it ranged throughout the course of the year to be an impact of about 190 points at the low to a high of about 420. So its, the median really was about 270, but it will ebb-and-flow obviously with the peak impacts seen in the higher production quarters of the second and third.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Just to kind of follow on to the previous question on the vertical integration kind of the impact there. So you said Anne that the average was about 270 basis points impact for the year; when you kind of look at, you mentioned you are in a leadership position there, you\u2019ve got price increases announced or would assume or have them planned for this year in ready-mix which looks like\u2019s the biggest negative impact that you guys are coming out of that vertical integration, how do we think about that 270 on a full year basis as we look into 2013, should we expect that to improve with some of these things going on or about the same, how do we think about that?","Anne Lloyd","Yeah, Trey you definitely will see improvement in that degradation and again that was 270 points as a median for the year. It did fluctuate during the course of the year, but particularly as we see ready-mix pricing begin to take hold more strongly in all of our markets, I think you will begin to see that margin compression go away.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","And so on a run rate, are we looking at maybe the margin compression going away by the end of \u201913 or it would take a little longer what's your thoughts there on timing?","Howard Nye","You know what Trey a lot of that's going to be driven by what happens, for example, with mid-year price increases this year. Keep in mind you only recover around 25% of those even when you put them in, any year, but I think measuring to see how much the price increases that we go up with at the beginning of the year matters and I think seeing what happens with mid-year is going to matter. I think depending on that you could see that compression pretty considerably by year-end.","Anne Lloyd","And just as a reminder Trey, I mean we are talking about the entire vertical business which includes Colorado, Texas and Arkansas, so you are going to look at the interplay in all of those markets.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","","And then on product mix, Ward you touched on that, do you guys kind of given your outlook for infrastructure and that sort of thing; I know you guys have touched on this in the past that with that you would anticipate selling more base rock when that starts to improve, when that end market starts to improve, you know so are you kind of thinking that this year 2013 you could see a mix shift, a product mix shift towards more base rock and if so kind of what the impact of that could be?","Howard Nye","I think we certainly could. I think we\u2019re trying to capture some of that impact in what we put out there for you right now, Trey. So hopefully we've given that a little bit of a forecast going forward. And candidly, I hope we do. I mean if we see more base stone going out of the door, what that means is we're seeing more new projects and we're certainly seeing more planning on new projects right now. So that would be something that we would be delighted to talk with you during the course of the year, but we believe we\u2019ve captured that in the two to four that we put out right now.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","And is that also reflective in the, you know, I think the wording was, that there was going to be a slight improvement in cost per ton; would that also be reflected there as well?","Howard Nye","It would, Trey.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Okay, and then my last question Ward, I have kind of asked you this in the past, a couple of different ways, just kind of really trying to get an idea for timing, but you know, you\u2019ve mentioned in the past when we're kind of looking at incremental, that you guys need to see, you know, an improvement across the enterprise and if you look at your guidance, at least by end market, it looks like everything with, I guess, with the exception of ChemRock and Rail, it's going to be up this year. Is that and I also know you need geographic impact, but kind of just all-in, when we look at 2013 and your expectation there, are we getting to a point where we can start to kind of think about that kind of incremental margin on aggregates when we look out this year?","Howard Nye","I think we're getting close to that period of time. Again, I think the disproportionate driver right now Trey, is going to be what happens in North Carolina and really what happens in places like Georgia and what happens in places like Alabama and Florida as well. If those places have some volume coming through particularly North Carolina, you are going to see those incremental margins very, very quickly. But again, the fact is when you are seeing even for a quarter, we saw for example, 15% volume growth in Indiana, so if we look at the Mideast, again, it\u2019s a bit like Texas, I am going to celebrate everyday 15% volume up in Indiana. But the primary thing that I need right now and the organization needs is that same type of percentage growth in North Carolina; if we see that then the timing to your question becomes almost immediate.","","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Okay. I do want to sneak one more I am sorry, on the heritage price just for clarity of 2% to 4% that does not include Denver now, even though we are kind of anniversarying it; we are still kind of excluding that from the heritage; is that accurate?","","Howard Nye","It\u2019s all in.","","Trey Grooms - Stephens","It\u2019s all-in okay, perfect. Thank you for that clarity and good luck. Thank you.","","Howard Nye","Trey, it\u2019s all-in; so once we eclipse the one year period after the acquisition of Denver, it counts as heritage.","","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Ward, can you talk about what your assumptions are for pricing in the downstream businesses; it looks like roughly you are guiding for 25% incremental margins in \u201913, which I think implies little pricing and I am wondering if you could just flush out for us what you think about pricing conditions in those markets and how we should be thinking about potential price increases over the course of the year?","","Howard Nye","I can tell you, what we are looking at right now principally on ready-mix, for example in Colorado we have come out with anywhere from a $5 to a $6 cubic yard price increase in that market; so obviously we are hopeful that that will stick for the year. I think we will probably be looking at similar percentage type increases in Texas as well; we are looking at increases in hot mix as well for you know, keep in mind, much of that\u2019s going to be driven by what may or may not happen with price of liquid as we go to the year relative to indexing. So I think you will clearly see pricing going up in hot mix is well whether it goes up at the same percentages that we are seeing in ready mix, I think it is an open question, but I\u2019ll try to give you a pretty definitive advance particularly in the ready mix side of it in Denver right now.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","And in terms of the IT implementation, I don\u2019t know if you could just talk about what sort of headwind that is in 2013 and does that roll out completely next year and any quantifiable benefit that we should think about heading into next year?","Howard Nye","You know Jerry, its [JDE] upgraded, basically what we said last year, we thought we spend around $1 million a quarter for last year and for this year, so clearly we anticipate that expense going away when we get here to the end of \u201813, and it just continues to help us keep our systems and what we feel like are leading edge because we feel like having that is also awfully important to manage and caution this business when your average selling price is less than $11 a ton.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Your comments on non-res for \u201813 are somewhat strong as I have heard; can you kind of talk about how you think the various submarkets of that are going to be or linked to this high single digit growth number?","Howard Nye","Yeah, as come back and look at Keith right now, I guess the primary thing that we are seeing is we are seeing considerably more office and retail and some industrial as well. And we started seeing the industrial in parts of even the Southeast last year and we started seeing that come back in markets like Charlotte in particular; we have seen relatively good industrial in parts of the Midwest.","So again, we are seeing more activity outside of the pure energy right now; what I can tell you to believe though is we will see most of that occur in what we like to refer to as the commodity belt. So if you are looking at that middle portion of the country going from Texas up to Dakota, I think you are going to continue to see an industrial renaissance in that part of the world in large part because power is getting so cheap there that you've got a lot of people moving in from around the globe simply to participate in that and its following on, on what's happened in the residential. I mean, I think we can't underestimate how powerful res is right now on driving what's happening with non-res. So what we said and when I try to spell out in the commentary is we thought we would see that 12 to 18 month lag and by the time we get to have two in 2013 we should be very much into that.","Anne Lloyd","I think a differentiator for us has got to be our ability to get into the energy play particularly if you are looking at our sector. And that does drive good solid performance in non-res and the other component of that, I mean most our of shipments have been called what I would call direct shipments into the energy field but there's going to be indirect development that continues to go on around that, whether that would be in the infrastructure component or in the non-residential component just to support everything that goes on in and around the oil field services. ","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Are you starting to see [close] activity already coming in for these type of projects?","Howard Nye","Yeah we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","So I was hoping to talk about specialty products and maybe to start with the fourth quarter, on a reported basis it looks like revenue was down about 2%. I know you mentioned the kiln started November 1 and contributed about $3 million of revenue. So I think that would imply organic growth was down more like negative 8%. ","So I'm just kind of curious what happened in the quarter on an organic basis? How we should think about 2013 and I want to know you mentioned that you are operating at capacity I was wondering if you could kind of help us understand a little bit better what that means in the context of what happened to the revenue in the quarter?","Howard Nye","Sure. Ted I think the primary thing to think about in this quarter is number one; you are really going through debugging in part on the new kiln that's there. So remember we are adding 275,000 tonnes of material coming out of the new kiln. ","I think what we have been pretty much true to saying is we are going to add $20 million to $25 million of revenue at the types of margins that we've been accustomed to there. They are really going to vary somewhere call it $31 million to $34 million to $35 million, that's probably your zone. ","I think one of the issues to remember in that business is when you are operating at capacity its just one or two small things that can really serve to move that margin a little bit one way or the other, a little bit of volume at one plant may do that, a large maintenance and repair project may do that as well. So as we are looking at that business again, we feel very comfortable A that the project is done and its operating the way that we would wish and that we have a year set up for next year that will be right in line with the type of estimates that we've had.","Anne Lloyd","But on the revenue line, Ted, if you look there were a couple of items that were driving there, you were correct we did have $3 million of pick up from the new kiln because the guys delivered that project just beautifully. We did have lower (inaudible) sales in our specialty business that (inaudible) is a product that's used to line the refractory mix instead of kiln and then we did have some impact of the bankruptcy of RG Steel that effected the sales.","Howard Nye","And the last thing I would note for you as well is if you look at the month of December for steel capacity utilization, it pulled back to around 71.7 and if you look back at the same point in December 2011, it was a 75.2. So you saw a significant pull back in steel utilization for the month and at the same time what I will tell you is snap back to around 75% in January and as I am looking at the forecast for steel going forward, it started out in the year thinking it would probably be up around 4% to around 120 million short tonnes and I think with the slow start where they saw at least coming out of last year, many are saying it's probably going to be up around 3% for a 100 million tonnes.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","So more of transient factors?","Anne Lloyd","You got it. I mean that core business running at capacity means that it can even flow but it should be with transient factors, it's something permanent in the core business.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Okay, on the incremental gross margins of specialty products, let\u2019s say they came in, or guidance I am sorry, would imply that 25% of the midpoint and over the last two years or three years, they\u2019ve been kind of in a 50% to 70% range. So, as we think about 2013, is this just layering on the new capacity? Is this a price cost issue and how should we think about that going forward over the next call it three years or so?","Anne Lloyd","That\u2019s one of the reasons we want to make sure that reiterated that the business is running at capacity. Obviously, we will have increased revenues in profits that will be generated from the new kilns. Since that\u2019s a 20-year take or pay project and those [tonnes] have already been [taken] for, but on the core business you are to a point where you really don\u2019t have additional product to go out and generate more revenues I mean you don\u2019t the product to sell then what will happen on that core business is that you will see that the pricing will be what\u2019s going to drive organic growth and then our ability to continue to control the costs and those costs, steal utilization and natural gas pricing. So those are those things look like they are in pretty good shape but you should not expect us to replicate the gross profit growth that we have seen there organically.","","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then the last thing I was hoping to squeeze in, could you just talk a little bit more about the $3.3 million of restructuring expense in the quarter kind of what it accomplished, how we should think about payback and looking forward what kind of restructuring potential that may be in 2013?","Howard Nye","","Sure, Ted, it primarily was we were just taking at a layer of management. So what we have it\u2019s a flatter organization today than we did prior to that and it\u2019s going to be a one-year payback and so you are going to get that $3 million every year.","","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Okay and just incrementally, is there anything, you are willing to kind of talk about that it could be on the conference in 2013?","Howard Nye","What I think to the extent that we will have any event to discuss we will talk about in future conference calls.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T. Please go ahead.","","Jack Kasprzak - BB&T","Back to the margins for a second, in the Southeast Group in the quarter sales were up, prices was up but your gross profit was down slightly negative, what was going on there?","Howard Nye","You know its really more Georgia driven right now than anything else, Georgia and Alabama. You have got certain degree of fixed cost there. I think part of what I am happy to say Jack, is we are starting to see some green shoots and some signs of light particularly in North Georgia that we haven't seen for a while, but that has been a corner of our business that has just been tough and has been dark. ","But as I look ahead, I guess, I would suggest two things, I am seeing more infrastructure work in Florida right now that I have seen for a while, and I am pretty pleased when I am seeing there and I think everyone should be as well. And again based on some of the volume trends that I am starting to see in North Georgia, I think we feel like it is probably seen the worst of the market, but it was clearly feeling most of that during Q4, Jack.","Anne Lloyd","Yeah, we didn't have to feel under absorption of fixed cost, we do have a little bit of increased freight cost that effected it, as we move that volume and we haven't move the whole lot of volume there, so that hit in the fourth quarter.","Jack Kasprzak - BB&T","And on ready mix, also I mean, slightly negative and just slightly different from last year on higher sales and I know I've different comparison but just in general on the ready mix business where the slight loss in the quarter, is the issue just we need more sales or is there anything else going on there?","Howard Nye","You know what, its twofold Jack, I mean that's the business, its not a Martin Marietta business, it\u2019s a ready mix business issue across the United States, I don't think anybody is really making money in ready mix right now, I think that is industry that strives to save itself to prosperity, I think we have done a lot to cut cost in that business.","I think two things need to happen now. I think it needs to have some volume and I think we are starting to see some volume come through, and the other thing that has to happen is we are going to have to recognize some pricing in that business. Those are the two things that have to happen to make it work, and it\u2019s a business that ought to work. It\u2019s not a business that we want to be in everywhere. It\u2019s a business that we are going to be in, if its in a market that we think is attractive for the long term and that's why we obviously increased our exposure to it in Denver, but again I think it\u2019s a volume and it\u2019s a price situation and I think that's very clear right now.","Jack Kasprzak - BB&T","","A little different question, but obviously on this call and some previous calls of yours, there\u2019s been a lot of conversation about the good trends in the middle part of the country. You mentioned industrial renaissance which I think is appropriate, related to energy what's going on in the energy field here, would you guys ever consider an expansion or an acquisition into something like frac sand, I know there are smaller tons there but the margins right now are pretty attractive, is that something that would ever come on the radar.","Anne Lloyd","Jack I hate to ever speculate on what we would or wouldn't do, because obviously we may have a number of things that we might be looking at under confidentiality agreements. But as a practical matter what I will tell you is the businesses that we like are businesses that have high barriers to entry, and being in the crush stone business as oppose to some degree of sand business really brings that there. The other thing that we have been really sensitive to is making sure that we operate with a safety and environmental sensitivity that's important. There are a number of issues around frac sand in particular that I'm mindful of and that we are watching carefully as an industry. So I'm not sure I've answered your question directly, I'm not sure that I can answer your question directly but I'll try to give you a sense of the types of things that move us more than others.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","","You mentioned (inaudible) to expect a tough comp in the first five months of the year because of favorable weather in 2012. If I recall a year ago you took on some greater than expected costs in the first quarter to meet the increased demand. Just wondering if you could help us think about how you are going to be managing your costs really through 2013 and maybe some of the various cost buckets that you are seeing and in particular the first part of the year should we anticipate perhaps not as aggressive purchasing activity as you did a year ago, just given that it looks like we are having a bit more of a normal winter.","Howard Nye","Actually if you think about it Garik what happened last year\u2019s volume really spiked up pretty considerably in the first quarter, I want to say volumes up 10.7% in Q1, which meant we had to come back a lot earlier. So what we were actually seeing was a little bit of spike in M&R because (inaudible) that we had to come back earlier, we had to come back at some places where we hadn\u2019t been for a while. If you go back to Q4 and look actually one thing that we did that I think made a lot of sense. If you look at what we are doing from the tons produced per working man hour metric, we were operating very, very efficiently during the quarter. We actually built some inventory in the quarter which is going to let us come back in the fiscal year of this year a little bit later, and obviously the more you can get out of those cold winter months before you have to start operating from a cost perspective and an efficiency perspective it\u2019s incredibly helpful. So we did try to take some lessons learned from last year, apply them to Q4 and that's what we have going forward into this first quarter.","Anne Lloyd","And they are for all Garik, I mean if I think about the categories of costs, I mean depreciation should be D&A should be about same as it is this year, really just general wage inflation and general cost inflation across the board. I don't think, balanced for usage and I don't think we've seen anything in our planning process that has such cost spiking up unusually. You know, I'll always caveat that the diesel fuel is a little bit of a wildcard, that even our planning for that, I think should hold pretty well barring any kind of unforeseen consequences out of that.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So the idea really is to come in when volumes spike seasonally and operate much at full capacity as possible.","Howard Nye","That\u2019s correct.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","And then my second question would be just on the pricing guidance, you talked a little bit about potential mid-year opportunities in some of your downstream assets for price increases. Just wondering how much of your pricing guidance on the aggregate side is predicated on media price increases as oppose to when you are seeing in the market for either January or April?","Howard Nye","Garik, the two to four that we are talking about doesn\u2019t have any mid-year in that. That\u2019s just based on what we believe coming out of the box here in \u201813. So to the extent that mid-year, that would just be help.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay, and then just lastly on the volume guidance. You talked about TIFIA being more of a 24 working opportunity at this point. Is there any TIFIA associated volume baked in to the 2013 outlook?","Howard Nye","You know, very little if anything baked in to that at all. We\u2019ve met while we said, we will start seeing awards here as we finish up the first quarter. We might see some activity on TIFIA and have to. The biggest play that we're going to have on that we will see next year and beyond. So, I wouldn't count on a big volume pop (inaudible) on TIFIA but I will tell you that\u2019s a wave and that wave is coming.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Betts of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","","Mike Betts - Jefferies","Just two questions from me if I could Howard and Anne. Firstly thank you for additional information on some of the downstream businesses, that does create one question in my mind, the actual gross margin does look quite high in relation to the aggregates business. Could you may be Howard talk about where you view that in the cycle, sort of a mid-teen margin. Is that at a high level or do you see potential significant upside to that and particularly where was it at the peak when demand was much higher? And then my second question just on the corporate charge, I am looking at the minus 11.1 in the earnings from operations. Apart from the restructuring cost of 3.3 is there any other one-offs in there? Thank you.","","Howard Nye","With respect to the restructuring we had the 3.3, we had the cost relative to information systems and we have talked about the incremental overhead at Denver. Those are the three issues that we fit them right. With respect to what we are seeing on asphalt; look I hear you on the margins they don\u2019t necessarily just knock my socks off and I think we can actually do considerably better with that. The primary thing asphalt needs is the same thing that aggregates needs right now, it needs volume, and again to the extent that we can control to our best ability what happens or doesn\u2019t happen with liquid asphalt, the asphalt business itself particularly in FOB business could be a very attractive business. But keep in mind we have significantly doubled down on our asphalt business with what we have done in Denver; again around 1.7 million tons of asphalt in Denver this year versus what would have been 1.5 million tons in our Heritage business. ","So if we are simply looking at that that give you some sense of numbers around that and one other thing is probably would noting is asphalt and Denver is not as expensive as asphalt is in the south west as well. So again if we are coming back and taking to look at market leadership in a place like Denver where we feel like we can do more, the fact is, I think we can see improvement in the asphalt.","Anne Lloyd","And Mike, I would add to that that we are at various times try to take advantage of the physical storage of liquid, if we can get a good price on that, and with liquid price up over 18% last year on average, if we can get just some of our consumption handled on the physical (inaudible) we can have better performance there.","Mike Betts - Jefferies","Okay, just a follow up there, where was the straight margin in that show previously?","Howard Nye","We have had such a modest asphalt component run business like we can go back and get that for you and take it offline, but I am not sure that we have here for you right now.","Anne Lloyd","Yeah, its really had a whole lot of asphalt volume and so probably those peaks wont be reflective of what the future is going to be.","Mike Betts - Jefferies","Okay, no worries, and then the Denver overhead in the corporate charge, how much in millions was that?","Anne Lloyd","I am sorry, Mike, the Denver overhead is not in the corporate charge, it\u2019s in the title SG&A. So that corporate charge is going to be the systems upgrade on severance cost or restructuring cost as well as think there is some incentive compensation cost included in that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo","Joey Matthews on for Adam; I had a question on your Ag line business. I wanted to see if you could shed some light on what kind of contribution you got from that this quarter since you mentioned it in the release and your opening remarks, both volume and profitability?","Howard Nye","No, I'm happy to talk really more about the volume than anything else. The Ag line business for us principally is going to be in the Midwest division and part of what we were pleased with last year I want to say and we ended up with around 1.3 million tonnes of Ag line last year, particularly in the Midwest. And I will well you Joey we really thought that was a pretty good year. ","So when we came in this year at 400,000 tonnes ahead of that, we were pretty pleased if we look at just what it was in the Midwest in Q4, it was around 953,000 tonnes in the Midwest. So up very nicely year-over-year and the quarter and up nicely year-over-year for full year as well.","Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo ","Great and I had follow-on question related to infrastructure demand. Do you see any difference or recent trends or maybe foreseeable trends with respect to demand for repair work versus new highway construction work and how you think about the balance between those two and the effect on your gross margins and volume?","Howard Nye","What I think there is more of an acute need for new projects right now because that\u2019s simply not been a place that we've been for the last several years and the emphasis because of the way the highway build has worked or candidly has not worked has been more focused on repair work for the last several years because there was not a long-term commitment from the federal government to be there to match the state. So to the extent now the states feel like they literally had a two-year path ahead of them to let some major projects. We think that's what we are more likely to see. Keep in mind, having two years of visibility today means that some place that we as an industry haven't been since 2007, and I think when Ray LaHood came out after MAP-21 was put in, he was pretty clear in saying that there was pent up demand in the new project sector as well. ","Again if we go and take a look at some of the different markets and in which we are participating and seeing activity right now, that's clearly what we are seeing in places like Florida, particularly central Florida and up. We are seeing an enormous amount of infrastructure activity in North Texas. Iowa DOT has got a record DOT program this year. So again even as we come back and reflect on what Virginia maybe trying to do with what its just easing through today, I think we feel like the larger projects will likely dominate at least over the next several years. But the nice thing is you always have to have the maintenance and repair. ","The only issue relative to the margins the other part of your question that I would again come back and say is to the extent that you are seeing more base stone go out for some period of time on new projects, that does tend to be a product that's priced call it 30% less than a clean stone. So that's simply part of the reality. At the same time being in a position to move that base out is a nice place for us to be.","Operator","And with no further questions, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.","Howard Nye","Thanks again for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ward Nye, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","C. Howard Nye","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials' quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're pleased to report first quarter results and, based on strong fundamentals and positive external indicators, can reaffirm our full year 2013 guidance.","As an initial reminder, this discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our first quarter 2013 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both ours and the SEC's websites.","Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and guidance. As anticipated, first quarter aggregates product line shipments declined 8.8%, indicative of a more typical winter in most of our geographic areas and, in a host of instances, colder and wetter conditions than usual. Accordingly, in the majority of our markets, we're seeing a later full start to the annual construction season compared with last year, when we benefited from an unseasonably mild winter that accelerated the start of construction on many projects.","To anecdotally illustrate the impact of weather, I'll cite our Des Moines, Iowa district. The average temperature in Des Moines for March this year was around freezing. In March 2012, with the exception of one day, Des Moines temperature never dropped below 50 degrees. Among other reasons, that's relevant because, as a general rule, the placement of hot mixed asphalt paving requires ambient air temperatures to be above 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Not surprisingly, March shipments in this particular district were down 29% in 2013 compared with the prior year. On a company-wide basis, the quarterly decline in aggregates product line shipments directly correlated to a reduction in our consolidated gross profit.","All that said, we are especially pleased with our first quarter pricing performance. Not only did our aggregates product line increased 5.7% over the prior year quarter, but we also achieved pricing growth in all -- in our vertically integrated operations. Our hot mixed asphalt product line pricing increased 5.6% and our ready mixed concrete pricing increased 8.8% or $6.64 per cubic yard. We believe the overall pricing performance compared with the prior year quarter is indicative of improving market conditions and the successful application of our disciplined approach to pricing.","Our quarterly results also reflect exceptional performance in the Specialty Products business, which established new records for net sales and gross profit for that business segment.","Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by many positive indicators of construction activity, including increases in housing starts, construction employment and highway obligations. The benefits of these improvements should be experienced during the remainder of the year. Accordingly, given solid pricing and volume fundamentals, we reaffirm our full year guidance initially provided in February.","Our first quarter aggregates product line pricing trend bodes well for our performance for the remainder of the year. The improvement was widespread, as evidenced by increases in nearly all of our markets. Growth was led by the West Group, where price increases implemented over the past year, along with the favorable impact of product and geographic mix, resulted in an 8.7% increase. Notably, this growth was led by the performance in our Texas markets. The Southeast Group reported a 5.8% increase, while the Mid-America Group had a 4.1% improvement.","As previously discussed, harsh winter weather hampered quarterly aggregates product line shipments, leading to volume declines in each of our reportable groups and 3 of our 4 end-use markets. The exception was the residential market, which, despite poor weather conditions, had a 1% increase in quarterly shipments over the prior year. The improving housing market, which is an important trend for both the overall economy and the aggregates industry, specifically, is leading the current economic recovery. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts in March was up 47% over the March 2012 rate. The increase in residential shipments represented the seventh consecutive quarter of improvement in this end-use.","The infrastructure end-use comprised 42% of our aggregates product line shipments for the quarter. We continue to see positive indicators of growth in this market for the remainder of the year. Through March, highway obligations for the current fiscal year are at their highest level since fiscal year 2010, and they're up 28% over the prior year period.","Further, highway contract awards for the trailing 12 months through February represented the first period of growth in almost 2 years. This trend continued in March with national highway obligations up 4% over the prior 12-month period.","These trends reflect funding stability provided by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP-21.","Additionally, at the state level, strong transportation programs in both Texas and Colorado should continue to provide positive volume momentum. Texas anticipates letting $9 billion of projects in fiscal year 2013, listing more than twice the amount let in the prior fiscal year. Also, Colorado's Responsible Acceleration of Maintenance and Partnership or RAMP program should infuse an additional $300 million per annum of construction in that marketplace over the next 5 years, effectively increasing Colorado's traditional highway budget by approximately 50%.","We continue to see an increase in applications for funding assistance provided by the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, or TIFIA. 17 states, including Texas, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia, have submitted proposed projects totaling more than $41 billion. However, the process to award TIFIA funds has been protracted as the U.S. Department of Transportation has opted to allow time for all applications to be submitted before selecting recipients. This isn't surprising given the TIFIA projects, by law, must be of a regional or national significance. Thus, we continue to believe the more profound impact of TIFIA will be experienced starting in 2014 and remain confident that the TIFIA funding provided in MAP-21 can support between $30 billion and $50 billion of incremental construction projects. We also believe the TIFIA program will likely be funded at similar or enhanced levels in future highway builds.","The nonresidential market continues to represent our second largest end-use, comprising 33% of our quarterly aggregates product line shipments. Volumes to this market were again driven by strong energy sector shipments. We continue to be encouraged by the Architecture Billings Index, or ABI, which measures billings for architectural services by construction type. The ABI has shown strength for 7 straight months. In February, it rose to its highest level since 2007. The ABI is the key indicator and typically leads nonresidential construction activity by 9 to 12 months.","To complete the discussion of end-uses, the ChemRock\/Rail market declined 12% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to weather and decreased coal traffic in the Western United States.","Our Specialty Products business generated $55.2 million of net sales, a new quarterly record. The 6.7% increase in net sales over the prior year quarter is attributable to the new dolomitic lime kiln at our Woodville, Ohio facility, which became operational during the fourth quarter of 2012. This growth was partially offset by the absence of a higher-margin sales to a customer that is currently in bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the sales increase led to a first quarter record gross profit of $19.6 million.","Our consolidated gross margin, excluding freight and delivery revenues for the quarter was 3.6% compared with 6.8% in the prior year quarter. The decline resulted directly from the reduction in aggregate shipments. The reduced operating leverage led to a very slight increase in our aggregates product line production cost per ton.","Consolidated selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.9%, up 150 basis points. On an absolute basis, these costs increased $4.6 million, primarily due to expenses related to our planned information systems upgrade expected to be completed later this year, as well as the nonrecurring software licensing cost, which provides a scalable platform for growth.","Consistent with our stated objective and history of possessing a lean and efficient management structure, effective January 1, we reorganized the groups within our Aggregates business. Our Southeast Group remains unchanged. Our newly created Mid-America Group includes operations in Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, which were previously reported in the former Mideast Group. The Mid-America Group also includes operations in Iowa, Minnesota, Eastern Nebraska, North Dakota and Washington, all of which were previously reported in the West Group. There were no other changes to the West Group. All prior period disclosures have been reclassified to reflect this change, and there is reclassified historical information on our website.","Our consolidated loss from operations for the quarter was $23.6 million compared with $35.3 million in the prior year quarter. Recall that 2012 quarterly earnings reflected $26 million or $0.34 per diluted share of business development expenses. Our loss per diluted share for the quarter was $0.61 in 2013 compared with the loss of $0.81 in 2012. The reduction in shipment volume directly contributed to the EPS decline when compared with the 2012 results, adjusted for business development expenses.","For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $19 million. We made prudent capital investments of $22 million and maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At March 31, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.22x, compliant with the limits under our debt covenant.","Earlier this month, we established a new 1-year $150 million trade receivable securitization facility, which replaced a $100 million facility that expired by its own terms. The new facility can be increased by as much as $100 million, subject to our trade receivables balance. Borrowings bear interest at 1 month LIBOR plus 60 basis points.","Consistent with our articulated strategic objective of possessing leadership positions in high-growth markets, in the first quarter, we entered into a purchase agreement with Lafarge North America to acquire 3 aggregate facilities in the greater Atlanta, Georgia area. This transaction, which will close later this year, will add over 800 million tons of permitted aggregate reserves in the Atlanta metropolitan area, thereby providing us an enhanced, valuable, long-term position. Once closed, we look forward to working with the teams of these North Georgia facilities as we integrate the operations into our existing business.","For the year, we continue to expect stronger new construction activity across the country, driven by the housing recovery, MAP-21, state transportation initiatives and emerging commercial development activity. As a result, we expect shipments to the infrastructure end-use market to increase in the mid-single digits. We anticipate nonresidential end-use market growth in the high-single digits. Further recovery in the residential end-use market is expected to continue, and we anticipate double-digit growth in these shipments. Finally, we expect our ChemRock\/Rail shipments to remain flat with 2012 levels. Cumulatively, we anticipate aggregates product line shipments to increase 4% to 6%.","As a reminder, we experienced an unusual quarterly pattern of aggregate shipments in 2012, and comparisons with prior year periods may continue to be affected in subsequent quarters in 2013.","We currently expect aggregates product line pricing will increase 2% to 4%. A variety of factors beyond our direct control may continue to exert pressure on our volumes, and our forecasted pricing increase is not expected to be uniform across the company. We expect our vertically integrated businesses to generate between $350 million and $375 million of net sales and $20 million to $22 million of gross profit. Increased production should generate operational efficiencies and lead to a modest reduction in aggregates product line production cost per ton compared with 2012.","Net sales for the Specialty Products segment should range from $220 million to $230 million, generating $81 million to $85 million of gross profit. Steel utilization and natural gas prices are 2 key drivers for this segment.","SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to decline slightly. Interest expense is expected to remain relatively flat compared with 2012. Our estimated effective income tax rate is 26%, excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $155 million.","To conclude, we believe the current residential construction recovery is strengthening and will serve as a foundation and catalyst for a much broader recovery in general construction activity. We also feel the first quarter's challenging weather-related operating conditions have masked more positive macro trends that will become more clearly visible over the course of the year. We look forward to capitalizing on these trends and enhancing long-term shareholder value.","Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials, if the operator will now give the required instructions. We'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arnold Ursaner of CJS Securities.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","I guess my question again, if you could expand a little more, you spoke in some detail about why you're optimistic for the year, but you did start with a pretty big hole in the ground at the beginning, an 8.8% decline, and yet you're reiterating a 4% to 6% volume improvement. Can you highlight some of the things that give you confidence that, that will occur?","C. Howard Nye","Sure. If we take a look at the way volumes went through the first quarter, they were down 5% in January, 7% in February and just about 13% in March. As you recall, Arnie, part of what we said for average, really, the last 2 weeks in March can make or break the first quarter. So if we're sitting here taking a look at this year's first quarter or, really, the history, it only ends up being around 17% of the volume that we have during the course of the full year. So if we'd look at the trends that we saw in the first quarter and then, frankly, come back and even see what the trends need to be for the next several quarters to get us to our range, I'm pretty comfortable with that. I mean, down 8.8% in Q1, for us to come out where we'd like to be, realistically, we need volumes up around 10% in the second quarter, around 15% in the third quarter, and we could actually see a flat-to-down quarter in Q4 and still be very comfortable with that range. So I think as we look at Q1 on a comparative basis and what we feel like the compares will be in Q2, 3 and 4, we feel pretty comfortable with that 2% to 4% that we have out there.","Arnold Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.","That's very helpful. My second question relates to the vertically integrated businesses. You surprisingly got some terrific price increases that I know you were hoping to get, but it seems like you've achieved them. The question I have is, as you mentioned some delays in work due to weather and some other factors, the increases that you've gotten, when are they likely to be impacting the work you have? When will you get the benefit of those price increases?","C. Howard Nye","Effectively, Arnie, the increases are in now as we're looking forward to the year. So what we've talked about is what we're recognizing or realizing to date. Part of what I've indicated, I think, on the call that we had at the end of the year last year, talking about this year, is I thought we would likely see even more midyear price increases than we've seen in the last couple of years. Obviously, we'll have a better feel for that when we speak next, after the next quarter results. But I think the price increases that we're talking about now, we are clearly going to reap the benefit of here over the next several quarters. Now in fairness, we did have -- and as I said in my remarks, we did have some benefit of some mix changes in those numbers as well. To put some direction to that, it's about 150 bps worth of change in the Southeast and 200 in the West. But one reason I like that, Arnie, is I see it going, really, to more clean stone in both of those markets, which tells me that we're seeing more ready mixed concrete activity. And what I would suggest to you is that has been the single weakest part of heavy side building materials now for a number of years. And the reason that I cite that is if ready mixed continues to get more healthy, I think we'll continue to see good movement on pricing in that space. I think it also gives pricing power in the other spaces as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","Just to take an additional step with the pricing question, pricing, obviously, up in all markets is positive. But how much of the West pricing was driven by success in Texas versus Colorado, which has been a relatively lower price market and I know a market that you've been placing a great deal of focus and increasing overall pricing, not just in aggregates, but in your downstream products?","C. Howard Nye","Kathryn, we clearly did see strength in Texas, but the good news is we're seeing strength in Colorado as well. If I'm looking on the downstream side in Colorado, we start ready mixed pricing up there 9% in Colorado, so nice strength in that, seeing asphalt up 6%. And obviously, we did have good momentum in Texas as well. So what I would suggest to you is, while Texas, in some respect, led it relative to the aggregates piece of it, the downstream activity that we're seeing and the pricing that we're seeing is pretty good in Colorado right now.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","What is the likelihood of a midyear price increase for aggregates and for downstream products? And how much of this increase would be driven by a higher cost versus just an increase in overall demand?","C. Howard Nye","Kathryn, I think the chances for midyear price increases are better this year than they've been in the last couple of years. Now, at the same time, we're early in the year, and part of what I always remind people, it's very difficult to take results in Q1 and try to extrapolate them to a full year. So I put that caution there. But I would still say I think they can be broader in our footprint than they were last year. If I look at the cost side, if from a practical perspective, at this point, Kathryn, the costs are remaining in pretty good shape. If you can tell me what you think is going to happen to energy, I can probably give you a better answer on what may happen with some of the pricing. But as we're looking right now, the energy piece of it has been pretty well behaved.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Your -- I guess being repetitive, but on pricing, again, your prices are up 5.7% in the quarter, and your guidance is 2% to 4% for the year still. Is part of that product mix, too, in terms of we get into the paving or the highway construction season, which is really an April-to-October season, and that's typically a lower average price? Is that part of the complexion of the pricing guidance too?","C. Howard Nye","Jack, that very much is part of the complexion. The nature of some of the jobs may change as we go through the year. So keep in mind, if you see more dirt work, and you see more new construction, it will mean more base, and you'll actually have a headwind relative to mix at that point. And I think it goes back to what I've said before, it's still early in the year, and while those trends look right, right now, and I think they're going to be good, I think we're just being cautious as we go forward here, Jack.","Anne H. Lloyd","Jack, this is Anne. If you take a look at the product mix impact for the Aggregates business as a whole, it was about 123 bps in the first quarter.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Is that a comparison versus the first quarter last year?","Anne H. Lloyd","Absolutely. Look at a mix -- so you got -- so that's what you picked up in the first quarter from a move from base to claims.","John F. Kasprzak - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Right. Got it. Okay. First -- Q1. And your guidance, too, on demand says -- or implies mid-single-digit improvement in the highway sector, public works sector. And Q1 is the throwout quarter for that sector, so volume's down 10% or 12%. It doesn't matter, but that's still a little better than what some of the industry forecasts are. Say, ARPU's [ph] up 3% or so. What gives you confidence that you guys can do a little better than sort of the industry forecasts?","C. Howard Nye","I guess a couple of things, Jack. One, it's where we are, so I would come back to the where. So if we begin with the notion that we're going to have $9 billion worth of bidding in Texas, I mean, that is twice what we saw last year, and people thought last year was pretty good. We had a record DOT budget in Iowa last year, and the DOT budget in Iowa this year is bigger than last year. Obviously, we talked a little bit about what the RAMP program is going to mean in Colorado. We think that's going to be a very attractive marketplace for us. We're seeing improved activity in Florida. Again, their DOT budget is up 72% year-over-year. So when we take a look at those states that can be impact states for us, it certainly gives us confidence. The other thing that's giving me some confidence are some of the McGraw-Hill numbers that, literally, have just come out this week, which I think very much reinforce the guidance. In '13, the total change in construction that they continue to speak to is around 8%. In non-res, they're seeing up 6%; and in residential, 26% up. So they're seeing housing starts very much knocking and staying at that million level this year. And what even makes me feel better, I know this isn't necessarily your question, Jack, but as I look at what their forecasts indicate for '14 and '15, I'm seeing 2014, at least according to McGraw-Hill, up 18%; and 2015, up 20%. So I think when we take a look at the states in which we have a significant presence, take a look at what we feel like it's been some of the latest forecast that have come out, literally, within the last week from McGraw-Hill and take a look at what we think the trajectory is going forward. I think that gives some nice book-ends to all of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ward, I'm wondering if you can provide some more context around what gives you the confidence around double-digit volume growth in the second and third quarter. Maybe you could step us through backlog, or maybe I'm reaching, but perhaps, you could tell us what April is looking like.","C. Howard Nye","I'll tell you more about April when we're together on this next call. But what I'll say, Jerry, if you think to what last year looked like, I mean, we came out of the gate with great vigor last year in the first quarter because we really didn't have a winter, and I think therein lies the story on what the delta is this year with respect to volumes. At the same time, as you think back to what we were also faced with in the second and third quarter last year, after we got into that early spring period, we really just hit wall in large respects with respect to aggregate volume, I think, because we were suffering from last year what we're not suffering from this year, and that was -- you had an enormous overhang from the election, and you had a great deal of uncertainty, particularly around commercial construction last year. And I think people were still trying to get their head around wholly, whether housing was back or not or whether that was a head fake. So I think if we take a look at where housing is now, and of course, you saw the March number...","[Audio Gap]","We're seeing commercial absorption late last year at 207,000 square feet just taken during the fourth quarter. That's the best number in that respect since 2007. Industrial vacancy in that community is below 10% right now. If we take a look at what's going on in Houston, it's got faster growth in Houston than any other large metro in the United States. So if they're looking at what they anticipate their CAGR to be from 2012 to 2017, they're looking at 5%. But here's what I'm particularly bolstered by, when we start looking, too, at North Texas, Jerry, because if you think about it, so much of what's been going on in South Texas has been energy-driven. And now what we're seeing in the first quarter in North Texas, in the Metroplex, Dallas-Fort Worth, is strong office leasing with a net 1.4 million square feet let in Q1. That's versus a negative 40,000 during the same period last year. Single-family construction in Dallas is at the highest level in 5 years. So it was up 35% from the prior year quarter. And right now, even in the Metroplex, which should -- had trailed, what we're seeing in San Antonio and in Houston, there are only around 3.5 months of inventory left on housing. So as we come back and take a look at what we see in infrastructure and commercial and that type of housing growth, and we take a look at what the numbers looked like last year in Q2 and Q3, I think those are the things that gives us the type of confidence that we have that we'll hit the volume projections that we have out there.","Anne H. Lloyd","If they're going to step up just to a little higher level, and look at volume growth or absolute volumes in the last 3 quarters of 2012 versus in 2011, that ranged from about 102 to 104 million tons that we shipped during those 3 quarters. And with the actual results in the first quarter and our guidance of 4% to 6% for the year, that infers that we need about 110 or 112 million tons to actually meet the guidance's expectations, which, as Ward indicates, really not a whole lot of volume given the strong underlying fundamentals.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And how would you characterize visibility and lead times in your business kind of compared to this time a year ago?","C. Howard Nye","It feels considerably better than it did a year ago. I think when we were coming out of this period last year, there was a higher degree, in my mind, of uncertainty around where construction was. And I think, again, that's part of what's driving the reinforcement of the end-uses and forecasts that McGraw-Hill just came out with this, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of midyear pricing, obviously, at this point in the cycle, you've -- when you've got the pricing momentum that you just reported here, presumably there are some markets where you're going to look to put in midyears in. Can you give us a sense on what proportion of your markets you're optimistic on additional pricing actions sticking at midyear?","C. Howard Nye","You know what Jerry, I will clearly go into more detail on that when we get to half-year. I think what's attractive about it right now is we're seeing up volume just about everywhere over the last couple of years, where it's been spottier. I would tell you to follow the volume. This year, with the volume trends that we're seeing, I do think they can be more widespread, but that's probably as specific as I want to be right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It seems that these levels of production, the incremental tonnage, really, has some significant impacts on gross margin. So my question is, if you hit your guidance or the middle of the pricing and volume guidance for the year, what should we expect the full year gross margins to be around, in let's just say the aggregates business?","C. Howard Nye","If we do that, depending on where the volume comes, I think we would start seeing the type of incremental volume margin expansion that we've been talking about, Adam. I think one of the biggest issues that we will face, and I think the industry will face, as volume comes back is where it's going to come back. And while volume has been good across the enterprise, what you're clearly seeing is still a much healthier business in the West right now than in the East. So if it continues to be that way, that's going -- it won't push them down, it just simply makes it more challenging. Part of what I am taking some comfort in right now, though, is relative to what's happening in jobs in a number of different markets. And I think this goes directly to your margin question. North Carolina, on unemployment rates, has been sitting at #47 in the country now for a while at 9.2%. Now for the first time here, as we're really coming into March, and I'm looking at the Martin Marietta states, I'm seeing year-over-year employment rates in North Carolina for the first time moving ahead of a national average. And if we're seeing that type of economic activity here and more tonnage here, it's going to come back and help us seriously address the margin issue.","Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. My second question is, if I think back when we've talked about weather before, my memory seems to suggest that you may -- I think you may have said that weather -- you'd always feel that it comes back, the lost volume from weather. Does that -- am I correct in remembering that?","C. Howard Nye","I think it wholly depends on the time of year. But I think when you've got a weather impact in Q1, I think all it does is it pushes it to the right. So I think we can take a high degree of confidence that we're going to have a shortened construction season, but I don't think that's going to end up being problematic for the industry this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was hoping to touch on, first, the margins in Aggregates. Obviously, we saw a really impressive pricing, up 6%, which I think gives you $17 million of revenue and profit benefit. Revenue is down $9 million, gross profit is down $9 million, which gives you some pretty sharp decrementals, admittedly, on down volumes. But -- and could you maybe give us the bridge you've historically provided to help us understand kind of the puts and takes that drove the change in gross profit?","Anne H. Lloyd","As you look at the aggregates product line, it's gross profit were down $9.4 million collectively, pricing strength contributed about $13 million, volume weakness took away about $22.5 million, and our costs were essentially a cush. So that $9 million, $9.4 million, essentially, just dropped straight to the bottom line, and it all came from volume.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. So would my math be right to say that costs per ton were up almost 10% year-on-year?","Anne H. Lloyd","They weren't up 10%, they were up slightly, and that would infer then that, again, our variable costs didn't move a whole lot. And the reality for the first quarter is that, for the first time in several beginnings of construction seasons, we actually did some planned grading. We uncovered and moved about 18% more, about 1 million more cubic yards of dirt actually unearthed, some reserves to be prepared for the construction season, and that did affect the cost structure in the quarter. And really, our production didn't decline either. Actually our production numbers, in preparing for what's coming up in the season, were strong. And if I go back and look at the relationship to production, to shipments, it's in line with what we had historically seen as the start of a strong volume builds. So we feel real comfortable with the cost structure. But you're right, I don't think the number was up 10%, but it was up slightly.","C. Howard Nye","Ted, let me give you a little more color to that because I think this will be helpful. If you look last year, in Q1, we used about 6.1 million gallons of diesel. To Anne's point -- this quarter, around 6.9 million gallons. With basically the same tonnage, that goes to Anne's point on what we were doing, moving about a million more cubic yards in stripping activities. And importantly, when we come back and take a look at what we're doing relative to productivity on tons produced per working man-hour, they remained almost the same from Q1 last year to Q1 this year, and keep in mind, operating in a much different and better Q1 last year than this year. So to have that degree of productivity maintained, I thought it was actually quite good.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Can you probably [ph] share that tons per hour, what that metric was on year-on-year?","C. Howard Nye","I typically don't give the exact number on that for competitive reasons but -- I publish that very carefully, but I can tell you it was almost spot on to where it was last year, Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. The other thing I was hoping to touch on is, could you just help us -- and I apologize if I missed this, but maybe just walk through the volumes at the state level for your biggest states, kind of Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, at the state level, what those numbers look like?","C. Howard Nye","You didn't miss anything on that, and actually, I'll give you at least a quick color on that. I'll go through some of the districts. If we're taking a look at just the Midwest Division, and really, that's important because they had a great quarter last year, that's where it was over 50 degrees, volume there for the quarter, Ted, was down about 16%. And again, that's one of those districts that I was talking about had a record DOT program last year, a bigger one this year. So volume down 16%, you feel like that's almost entirely weather-driven. At the same time, you come back and take a look at different districts in Texas, volume actually up in the Houston district all by itself, that's not surprising. You've got good weather there, volume actually up in North Texas. So we look at those as really 2 very different markets. At the same time, you come back and take a look at North Carolina West, meaning Greensboro, and that area, volumes down there, indicative of a pretty tough winter. And if we look even in North Georgia, again a very difficult winter, volumes down there around 11%. So those are the types of percentages that I very much would have expected with the weather we've had this year compared to last year. But that gives you some real specificity in some live markets.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And the last thing, I just wanted to come back to a comment I thought I heard Anne make in response to one of Jerry's questions, where you said that you thought that the implied target you'd have to hit in the remainder of the year were -- my interpretation to what you said is it really wasn't a stretch. So is there a potential we can infer that to suggest that your volume guidance, the risk bias is skewed to the upside?","Anne H. Lloyd","I wouldn't say that. We're usually pretty pragmatic about the guidance that we give. Our view of the 4% to 6% is reasonable. But obviously, with the depth of the volume decline in the first quarter, we've wanted to relook it to make sure that not only did our forecasts hold up, but that it actually seemed logical that -- given the fundamentals of the market. So on average, we would have to see volumes up, on average, 7% to 9% through the back half, back 3 quarters of the year to meet our targeted 4% to 6%. Do I think there's a risk to the upside? I hope so, but it's still a long 5 years. We'll see.","C. Howard Nye","We'll take that risk, Ted.","Anne H. Lloyd","Yes, we'll take that risk. That's right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","When you're looking at your -- at the different states that you guys have that are disproportionately important from a margin standpoint, they've been definitely -- at least several of them have been lagging. It sounds like you're seeing some things that might point to some optimism in those states. But as you kind of look at your guidance, with the -- being decent improvement we're seeing in volume or expected to see in volume, how does that sort out for those disproportionately important states from a margin standpoint, and your expectation for those relative to the guidance you've given?","C. Howard Nye","I think part of what we're seeing right now, Trey, is we think those states that are disproportionately important, at least some of them have found bottom, and we think they're improving. I think that's really important. And candidly, that's part of what we saw as we were looking at the acquisition that we made in North Georgia as well. I mean, here's some things to think about. If we look at construction employment across the United States, in Texas, which everyone gets is in a great place right now, we're seeing 5 -- 5.6% change positively year-over-year. But if I suddenly come back and take a look at South Carolina, it's 3.5% positive year-over-year, as is Georgia, as is Florida. So we're starting to see construction jobs come back in that bottom right-hand corner on the map that we keep drawing a circle around. Now North Carolina, as we said, continues to lag on construction employment. At the same time, when I'm looking at overall employment trends, North Carolina, for the first time now in years, has gone ahead of the national average. So if we look at those type of statistics, and we start looking at some of the jobs and work that's out there, particularly as we start heading into '14, it certainly gives us much greater confidence in the southeastern U.S.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. So it's reasonable to think that North Carolina, for example -- that North Carolina, it's reasonable to think that it could continue to maybe trail the overall average, but maybe the expectation is to see more, maybe it outpaces as we look into '14, and that's when we could really see some big margin improvement coming from that region?","C. Howard Nye","Trey, I think that's exactly the way to look at it. I mean, if you look at it right now, it has a work plan in 2013 that's 14% positive. But again, I think that's going to have more forward view to it than significant near term. So I think the way that you captured it in your words is entirely correct.","Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division","All right. And then I guess the last question is more kind of longer term, how to think about pricing. Given all the changes that we've seen in the industry throughout the last 10 years and through this downturn, and I understand it's early, but I mean, next year, in some of the numbers you threw out there, it's reasonable to expect some pretty significant volume improvements as we look at '14 and beyond. But in that kind of environment, with some of those numbers, just hypothetically, if those numbers kind of shake out, what could we or should we be thinking about? I mean, if you guys are putting up this kind of price through this downturn, what should we be thinking about as a pricing range in a much more robust type of environment for as far as demand goes?","C. Howard Nye","Trey, that's a great question. And part of what I celebrate is I think we finally have put it to the acid test with respect to pricing historically. So I think we'll celebrate that here for a moment. Here's the way that I think I'd think about that, Trey, and I think we're seeing it to a degree with what we've put up this year. Part of what we have really given some thought to, is as these volumes continue to grow, particularly as they grow in advance of 5% per annum, I don't think it's going to be unusual for you to have pricing that's on a percentage basis. It's going to stick relatively close to that with a bit of a lag. So let's talk about -- let's use easy math. Let's say volume is up 10% next year. If the theory is correct, you could see them 7.5%, 8%, that's the type of lag that I'm talking about. So I think depending on how you think volumes will be and how elastic you feel like that may be, that's how I would be working with that model.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I don't think you gave the actual number for the decline in infrastructure. Maybe I missed it, and by the way, I apologize I got cut off for a minute. Can you give me that number in the first quarter?","C. Howard Nye","As far as the tonnage that went to infrastructure, the down, it was also less [ph] than 5%. So it was 42% of our volumes. Commercial was 33%, Res was 14% and ChemRock\/Rail was 11%.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And on the -- just to comment at a question that a couple of people would follow up on different ways, you talked about how you can still get to the annual volume guidance despite the first quarter being soft. And you talked about that if you're up 10% in the second quarter, up 15% in the third quarter, you can be flat to down in the fourth quarter. Is there a reason to actually think that you're going to be flat to down in the fourth quarter? Or is that just sort of giving an example?","C. Howard Nye","That's really just more using an example. If you think about it, last year, Todd, Q4 actually went on pretty long. So actually, the way that I've just kind of modeled it out of my head, we could be down as much as 3% in Q4 if you wanted to say, winter would come in early, if you had a good Q2 and a good Q3. So I think it just depends on how you want to really put the numbers at the end of those rather than in the middle. But I think you're clearly looking at double digits up in Q2 and Q3 if you want to make the 4% to 6% up. And again, based on what those quarters look like, I don't think that's a huge stretch, Todd.","Anne H. Lloyd","Just as a reminder, Todd, remember volumes were actually down in the third quarter last year because of all the uncertainties surrounding the economy.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sure. Okay. On the pricing side -- and again, I was cut off, so if I missed this, I apologize -- but I can't help but notice that the 5.7% increase in price in the first quarter is a larger numeral than 2% to 4%, which is your guidance for the full year. I mean, was there that much mix in there? You talked some about the mix effect. But was there that much of a mix effect in there?","C. Howard Nye","First of all, I complement you, you don't miss a thing. Todd, no, I mean, there was some mix effect. And to give you, it was 123 bps rolled up. If you want to break it down, it's about 150 for the Southeast and 200 in the West. And to really give you some sense on the way that the mix worked, in the Southeast, we went from 40% base last year to around 30% base this year. And in the West, we went from 49% clean stone last year to 56% clean stone this year. So that, at least, was the mix play that was in there. Even if you take that mix number out, I mean, still, pricing was very healthy for the quarter. I will certainly concede that. I would simply come back and say it's the first quarter. It's January, February, March. Do I like what I've seen on pricing? Yes. Do I think it could be awfully good? Yes, I think I probably do. Am I going to be cautious and say let's give this some time? You bet.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Understood. Understood all that. And then switching gears talking about Specialty Products. Can you quantify the impact of that customer bankruptcy just in terms of -- with however you want to look at it?","C. Howard Nye","Yes, it was Feris Point [ph]. And here's the way to think about it, Todd. They went into bankruptcy last year in May, which tells you that, as a practical matter from a month's perspective, we've already weathered, really, the worst of that. From a sales perspective, call it, probably $3 million worth of sales last year.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","For the sales last year, not in the first quarter?","C. Howard Nye","In the quarter.","Anne H. Lloyd","In the quarter.","L. Todd Vencil - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. So is this -- is the quarterly -- the first quarter number that I realize you have some guidance out there, but is it sort of the run rate to anticipate? Or how is the kiln running? Is that a factor at this point to just run a full out?","C. Howard Nye","The kiln is running well. It's been debugged. It's running at a rate that we anticipated that it would. We feel very good about the way our business is looking right now in Woodville and Manistee. Our teams have done exactly what we would have hoped to and 10% more.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Just given the slow start to the year in the downstream businesses, in part, because of weather. If my math is right, I think you need about 70% incremental margins to hit the midpoint of your full year profit guidance for the downstream businesses. So generally, these are lower incremental businesses. The way that we think about it, I was just wondering if you could walk us through a little bit on how you're thinking about the profit ramp in the downstream businesses. And is this mainly pricing-dependent given the strength in pricing that you're getting? Or is this something along the lines of a better operating leverage? Or is the plant level that's going to drive these incrementals higher?","C. Howard Nye","It's going to be both, Garik. I mean, clearly, we are anticipating that volumes would be better. I mean, so let's begin with that notion. At the same time, when we're sitting here right now with ASP up  in ready mixed 9% and ASP up in hot mixed 6%, even the pace of, candidly, liquid moving down, those are pretty good numbers. To go back and give you a sense of at least what those volumes looked like last year, in San Antonio, on hot mixed, we did about 1 million tons; and in Denver last year, around 1.7 million. So that will -- and then do some rounding for the Arkansas business. If you think about what the ready mixed yards looked like in Colorado last year, around 1 -- almost 1.5 million. And in San Antonio -- I'm sorry, it's 1.5 million rolled up. In Rocky Mountain, it's around 930,000; and in San Antonio, around 0.5 million; and then call it 125,000-ish in Arkansas. That gives you a pretty good roll on the way those volumes will work. Obviously, the pricing isn't going to be the same in all of those markets, and we feel like some of those are more attractive than others. But again, the biggest single downstream component that we have right now is what we have in Colorado. And as we take a look at the way that, that business is performing right now and the way that we feel like that's going to work going forward, we've got a pretty high degree of confidence that Colorado is going to be where we'd like it to be here by the end of the year. We've got good bidding activity there, and we're seeing good residential activity, we're seeing good commercial activity, and we like the mix of business as well, separate and distinct from what's going on with the RAMP program in Colorado DOT.","Anne H. Lloyd","And Garik, I would add that I think what you're referring to is incremental margin there is -- remember a lot of that comes from the seasonality of the earnings pattern in that business because it is -- it is so Colorado in focused. You generally have losses that you carry in that business through probably the first 4, 5 months of the year, and you make all of your money in the last 6 or 7. So I think it's really more the seasonality of the earnings pattern that you're seeing as opposed to an incremental margin concept.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That makes sense. Some companies have been talking about ready mixed truck shortages. Some mentioned last week on their call. Other companies have been pointing to that as well. Just wondering if we can get your view on -- this could be a potential risk to your volume guidance. And the trucking shortages downstream might delay the timing of projects. And in turn, that might back up when you'll be shipping into some of these projects throughout the balance of the year. Is that a potential risk at all?","C. Howard Nye","Garik, I think it is a potential risk. I'm not sure I'd highlight this as an enormous risk right now, but I think it is a potential risk. In fact, if you take a look at the areas at which we actually produced more this year than last year, it was really in 2 pretty distinct places. We did that in South Texas, and we did that in portions of Colorado. Our sense was having that material on the ground and in a position to ship it earlier rather than later might be helpful for a variety of reasons, including trucking. So that inventory build was not accidental.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess just lastly, you mentioned the pending deal with Lafarge in Atlanta. Just wondering if you can comment, Ward, just on your interest in the future acquisitions, specifically your interest at this point in smaller deals versus larger deals, potentially revisiting bulk-in or other large comparable bids at this point in time, Ward.","C. Howard Nye","Garik, the primary thing we're focused on right now is running our business exceptionally well, and I think our teams are doing that. And to the extent that we find transactions that we think build shareholder value, we're certainly going to look at those. I mean, one of the issues that we recognize is we do want to bring down our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, and we've been very transparent about that. And if we can have that at a range of, say, 2.5x by year-end, I certainly wouldn't have my feelings hurt if that's where we found ourselves. Obviously, I think doing this Lafarge transaction makes an enormous amount of sense for us. If you take a look at the locations that we have in that Atlanta market and think of Atlanta as a clock, we've really bought some operations that are really between, say, 2:00 and 5:00 on that clock and over to the East. So if you remember what our strategic objectives are, and that's to find attractive markets and to have the #1 or #2 position in those markets, we think that's what we're accomplishing with this Lafarge transaction. And again, I think that's wholly consistent with entirely what we have been talking with the analyst and investment community about. And I think to the extent that we can do more of that, that's what you should expect us to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. But just quickly on the Lafarge deal, can you give us some sort of indication as how large the revenue, what the profitability of those units would be?","C. Howard Nye","Keith, really, right now, pending the closing of it, I'm not in a position that I can do that. But I can tell you, it's Lithonia and it's Newton and it's Morgan County quarries, and you can probably get a sense of what volumes look like there.","Keith B. Hughes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And the close date, again, I think you mentioned it earlier.","C. Howard Nye","Actually, we didn't mention the actual date. We're looking to do that sometime very early in Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Betts of Jefferies.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions for me. The first one is a follow-up on that Lafarge thing. I mean, they put out a press release in early January saying they were selling 6 quarries for $160 million in Georgia. Is your purchase part of that? And 800 million tons of assets, if it is, that seems a pretty attractive purchase price. Is any of these aggregates reserve not permitted or in a particular big block in one location?","C. Howard Nye","Number one, it was not part of that release, as I understand it, Mike. So this is separate, so it's not in those numbers. It is 3 locations. And the Lithonia location has the biggest single block of reserves, and I don't think there's any question about that. But the 800 million number that I've put out is the permitted reserves number.","Michael Betts - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one for Anne on the SG&A and the IT cost of $4.6 million or so. Correct me if I'm wrong because I probably am, I thought the additional cost of that program was running at kind of like $1 million a quarter. Was it something specific exceptional in Q1 or if you brought the cost forward? Or maybe like a bit more explanation on that would be useful.","Anne H. Lloyd","Yes, Mike. The core information systems upgrade project is about running at $1 million a quarter, plus or minus a couple hundred thousand, every quarter, depending on the timing. So we did have a renegotiation of our Oracle license in the first quarter of 2013. That was a onetime charge of $2 million that you'll see. That is -- part of those  costs. That will provide us with a platform that is much more scalable. But that won't recur in the second quarter. You should see it get back to about $1 million a quarter.","C. Howard Nye","In fact, Mike, it shouldn't recur anytime soon for a while.","Anne H. Lloyd","Not for a while.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.","C. Howard Nye","Again, thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call and for your interest in our company. We are optimistic about our business opportunities for the rest of this year, and we really look forward to discussing second quarter 2012 results with you in July.

You may begin, sir?","Howard Nye","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on our Web site, supplemental financial information which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on Slide 2, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses we are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except if it's legally required, we undertake no obligation to publically update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our supplemental financial information as well as on our Web site and in our SEC filings.","By leveraging a full year of acquired TXI operations with our heritage business, 2015 enters the books as a record year. Specifically, we achieved record safety results, record net sales and profitability. Expanded consolidated gross profit margin, exceeded incremental margin targets for the consolidated heritage business, exceeded acquisition synergy targets in both dollars and timeline, invested capital in our business, completed several bolt-on acquisitions and returned nearly $630 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","These impressive results were achieved with both tailwinds and headwinds. The tailwinds, 2015 construction markets experienced continued growth in private activity led by housing as well as the emergence of enhanced public sector activity as best revealed by a 7% increase in highway construction. Nonetheless we had a very significant headwind as 2015 saw unprecedented amounts of precipitation in our core states of Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia, and Colorado disproportionately impacting second and fourth quarter performance. By some estimates and indeed our own calculation and internal plans, multiple sustained extraordinary weather events combined with the downturn in energy sector shale development likely cost us up to $200 million in sales for the year masking the underlying strength of general construction.","That underlying strength is revealed in the solid growth we see across our business with the market acceleration of the construction recovery in key southeastern markets, fueled by steady employment growth, continued private sector activity and expanded department of transportation programs. We, thus, enter 2016 with what we believe are very favorable market and operating tailwinds building upon our team's record 2015 results. These past results and future opportunities are tied to our strict and steadfast attention to cost discipline further underscoring the positive result of years of improving our operating efficiency.","We are also specifically very proud of our 2015 record safety performance, a core foundational pillar of our company. We concluded 2015 with incident rates better than what had been 2014's then record results. Notably, we continue to see a dramatic improvement in the safety numbers of the former TXI operations further underscoring our successful operational and cultural integration. Safety is first at Martin Marietta.","In December we completed construction of our state-of-the-art Medina rock and rail quarry near San Antonio, Texas. Shipments from Medina are expected to replace rail shipments from our Beckmann Quarry as it transitions from a distance rail and truck served quarry to wholly focusing on the local San Antonio marketplace. The Medina job was on time and on budget. The construction of this $160 million facility spanned three years, is the largest and most complex capital project in the company's history and is now the largest quarry on the Union Pacific Railroad's vast network. Medina began operation in January 2016 and we expect to ship nearly 6 million tons of aggregates this year.","As highlighted in today's press release, we continue to execute against our strategic objective of securing and solidifying leading market positions in economically diverse high growth areas. In November 2015, we purchased Front Range aggregates. And last week, we acquired Rocky Mountain Materials in Southern Colorado, near Colorado Springs. These two bolt-on transactions complement our position in Metro Denver in Northern Colorado, a position we originally acquired in 2011 with our River for the Rockies asset exchange and provide attractive and leading positions along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, home to over 80% of Colorado's population.","Following these recent transactions, we have added an estimated 1 billion tons of aggregate results. Strategically four years ago we had no front range position whatsoever. Today, we are a marketplace leader with nearly 100 years of high quality construction aggregates and reaching with near and long-term favorable employment and demographic conditions.","Turning to the fourth quarter performance. We established quarterly records for net sales and profitability driven by strong pricing, disciplined execution of our strategic plan and steady growth in construction activity. Importantly, all segments in the aggregates business delivered increased net sales and gross profit while expanding gross profit margin. We exceeded our incremental margin target on both a heritage and consolidated basis. Heritage gross profit margin expansion was led by the West Group with a 630 basis point improvement largely resulting from strong pricing and realized TXI synergies. As shown on Slide 7, through the end of 2015 we have realized approximately $100 million of our $120 million synergy target, reflected in both the acquired business and heritage West Group performance. We are on track to fully realize our $120 million synergy target by the end of this year.","On a more granular basis, our 2015 record results were driven by strong pricing across our aggregates, aggregates related and cement businesses, as shown on Slide 8. Notably, the heritage aggregates product line delivered an increase of more than 7% in average selling price while heritage ready mix concrete prices increased nearly 10%. The acquired businesses, aggregates, ready mix concrete and cement so price increases of 13%, nearly 11% and 10% respectively, in line with our stated objectives. For the year, heritage aggregates product line volume increased 2% and total aggregates product line volume increased 7%. This is again despite record our near-record recurring precipitation in five of our largest states.","The Southeast and the Mid-America Group's lead volume growth on the strength of recovery in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas. The West Group which was most affected by the adverse weather conditions reported an increase in aggregates volume of 1.2%, excluding TSI related divestitures which affect comparability with the prior year. Aggregates volume growth for the year was notable in North Texas but was somewhat offset by declines in direct shale energy aggregates shipments in South Texas.","Volumes grew across all product lines with the exception of asphalt where our Texas divestiture in the fourth quarter affected year-over-year comparability. Of note, asphalt margins expanded to 28% or just over 1000 basis points, clearly reflecting improved profitability in our core Colorado asphalt business. Consolidated gross profit margin was 22% and expanded by 260 basis points for the year, led by margin expansion in all construction materials related segments. Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased $130 million over the prior year with margins expanding 480 basis points to 23.8% of net sales. Incremental gross margin for the heritage aggregates business exceeded targeted objectives for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2015. The incremental gross margin of 82% for the full-year 2015 was led by growth in both the West Group and the Southeast Group which achieved incremental gross margin of 135% and 78%, respectively. These are great testaments to our team's focus on controlling costs and delivering outsized results, despite extraordinary uncontrollable weather headwinds.","The acquired businesses gross profit margin also expended 300 basis points in 2015 led by acquired aggregates product line gross profit margin of nearly 27%, up from 4.6% for the comparable prior year period, reflecting synergy realization and underlying strength in both volume and pricing. Due to the September 2015 sale of our California cement business, quarterly results for the cement segments are not comparable to the prior year period and in fact comparability will be affected throughout 2016. Quarterly details for the cement business can be found on Slide 9 for elimination of the California results. However, the remaining cement businesses benefited from Martin Marietta's significant pricing improvement in 2015.","Average selling prices increased 10%, aided partly by the expiration of legacy TXI cement contracts at below market pricing and the divestiture of the California business. For the year, the business generated $368 million in net sales and delivered a 28% gross profit margin. A 310 basis point improvement over the prior year. EBITDA for the business was $101 million, a $30 million increase. The magnesia specialties business was negatively affected by a slowdown in the steel industry in 2015. Steel capacity utilization was down from approximately 78% in 2014 to 71% in 2015.","Full-year net sales were $228 million, a decline of $9 million or 4% compared to the prior year. The magnesia specialties team diligently managed the cost profile of the business during the year and despite steel capacity utilization declines delivered an impressive 35% gross profit margin. On a consolidated basis, 2015 delivered record net sales of $3.3 billion, an increase of $589 million or 22%. Record gross profit of $722 million, an increase of $199 million or 38%. Record net earnings of $289 million, an increase of 86% and record adjusted EBITDA of $766.7 million, an increase of 30%.","The significant improvement in net earnings coupled with the absence of TXI related costs drove an increase in operating cash flow in 2015 to $573 million compared with $382 million in 2014. Operating cash flow per share of $8.55 improved 8% when compared to adjusted 2014 which excludes the cash impact of TXI related expenses. We invested $318 million of capital during the year, including $78 million related to the new Medina rock and rail quarry.","For the year, we returned nearly $630 million to our shareholders through the combination of repurchasing 3.3 million shares of our common stock together with our dividend. As a reminder we have board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares. Finally, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 2015 was 1.9 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant and below our targeted leverage of two times.","In summary, 2015 was a remarkable year for Martin Marietta and despite being tempered by extraordinary weather that cloaked our true earnings potential, our team is poised for an even stronger 2016. We are confident we have the foundation in place for improved growth, profitability and performance. We will now look to the future and discuss our 2016 outlook which we highlight on slides 11 through 13.","Initially, you will note some improvement in our expected growth as compared to our very early thoughts provided in third quarter 2015. Our 2016 outlook now reflects growing underlying demand and strong pricing across our entire geographic footprint. National employment growth is stimulus for construction activity, remained robust throughout 2015 surpassing the per-recession peak by nearly 5 million jobs. These job gains in addition to contractor backlogs resulting from historic 2015 rainfall, should fuel growth and further recovery of the U.S. construction industry in 2016 and beyond.","Public sector growth is expected to drive mid-single digit volume increases in our infrastructure business which accounted for 41% of our aggregates demand in 2015. The growth reflects continued state level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Iowa, Georgia and Florida. For example, in Texas, nearly $10 billion of department of transportation lettings are planned, up from $6.1 billion in 2015. Dallas, Fort Worth alone is the beneficiary of four major design build projects aimed at mitigating that areas congestion and improving traffic flow. There is also significant and continuing infrastructure work in and around Houston.","Additional evidence of state level infrastructure investment tailwinds is revealed by recent project scheduling changes announced by the North Carolina department of transportation or NCDOT. Specifically, after the passage last year of various new state funding initiatives, NCDOT announced an accelerated schedule for 90 highway projects. This example is consistent with our articulated expectations around state construction project backlogs.","In addition to state level initiatives, we now have the five-year, $305 billion Fixing America's Surface Transportation or FAST Act. Enacted in December 2015 to provide states with the required funding certainty for the first time in nearly a decade to commit to a backlog of longer term projects needed to improve and expand America's transportation network. We believe the FAST Act along with state level funding initiatives will drive large multi-year, aggregate intensive construction projects. Further, it's also likely we will see meaningful projects in rural areas that have been infrastructure starved during the last decade and will now be better able to develop new avenues for growth and commerce.","Shipments to non-residential construction projects, 32% of our 2015 demand, is expected to increase in both the heavy industrial and light commercial sectors leading to an increase in aggregates volume in the high-single digits. The light non-residential construction sectors, primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential activity. Notably, the Dodge Momentum Index is near its highest level since 2009, signaling continued growth.","Further, four of Martin Marietta states account for five of the top ten and nine of the top 20 in state level employment growth inculding Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia and Colorado. All positive catalysts for construction activity. The heavy non-residential construction sector is primarily industrial building as well as energy and energy-related activity. We are currently supplying several large energy related industrial and infrastructure projects along the Gulf Coast and expect our project backlog to grow, thus largely offsetting the declines in direct shale exploration activity.","We believe direct shale activity reached a maintenance level in the fourth quarter of 2015 and should sustain at that level throughout 2016. Of course results for the first and second quarters of last year reflected higher than maintenance level consumption and are expected to affect comparability to the first half 2016 results.","The residential end-use market accounted for 17% of aggregate shipments in 2015 and increased 20% as compared to 2014. We expect a double-digit volume increase again in 2016 reflecting the continued steady recovery of residential investment as a result of positive employment gains, historically low mortgage rates, significant lot absorption and higher multi-family rental rates. New housing permit activity was up 12% in 2015, indicating further future gains in housing construction. Importantly, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Georgia and North Carolina, each ranked in the top ten states for housing starts.","Finally, to conclude our discussion of 2015 end-use markets, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 10% of aggregates volume and is expected to remain relatively flat to modestly down in 2016. We will now focus on Texas where we continue to be encouraged by the resilience of the broader marketplace. In short, we anticipate increasing overall demand driven by solid population and employment growth. Construction activity in our larger volume markets, principally being the vibrant corridor at Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, is expected to grow throughout 2016 and beyond led by multi-year infrastructure activity, a strong residential marketplace and solid non-residential construction.","South Texas of course has seen a decline in shale oilfield activity, thus reducing our direct shipments by 2.5 million tons in 2015. Again, much of this decline is expected to be offset by the combination of large multi-year energy projects as well as new and ongoing energy corridor road repair work. In late 2016 or early 2017, we will open a new aggregates facility on Martin Marietta owned property at the Hunter cement plant northeast of San Antonio. This undertaking will allow us to transition from our least and nearly depleted new Braunfels quarry only ten miles away to a permitted location with over 400 million tons of quality aggregate materials providing improved access to local market. The Hunter aggregates quarry will be an additional synergy from the TXI acquisition that will benefit our company in 2017 and beyond.","Our expectations for 2016 volume levels in Houston have moderated from 2015 levels where we saw an 11% increase in aggregate shipments. We now expect the aggregate volume in that marketplace to be broadly flat with any potential upside being spurred by large infrastructure projects and any downside being driven by a sharper deterioration into Houston economy. That said, it's important to remember that our principal Texas markets are located in north and central Texas and not materially impacted by Houston market conditions.","The Portland Cement Association or PCA forecasts modest demand growth in Texas in 2016 followed by stronger growth in 2017. We currently expect 2016 cement volume to increase 8% to 11%. We have previously announced the cement price increase of $12 per ton effective April, 2016. Based on the expected flow of shipments we will likely realize a year-over-year average selling price increase of approximately 9%. Both volume and price growth forecasts exclude the 2015 results of the divested California cement business. Profitability is forecasted to increase by an estimated $30 million in 2016.","On a consolidated basis, 2016 is expected to deliver record setting results, including net sales ranging from $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, expanded gross profit and expanded EBITDA, as we have consistently stated our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. They are investing in aggregates led acquisitions, organic capital investment to ensure safe, environmentally sound and highly efficient operations and returning cash to shareholders in the form of a sustainable meaningful dividend and share repurchases under our existing authority.","To conclude, we are optimistic and excited about 2016. We enter the year with an enhanced foundation for further growth and outlook for improved business conditions across the vast majority of our markets led by solid private sector construction activity and a newly reinvigorated public sector. Our team remains focused on the careful execution of our strategic plan, wholly committed to our core foundation of pillars and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.","If the operator will now give the required instructions we will turn our attention to answering your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","The first is just on visibility in general, particularly related to states that have passed new pieces of legislation that should -- we already have seen a significant increase in tax receipts for infrastructure. But the question I have for you, particularly for Georgia and North Carolina given the changes in 2015, have you seen volumes flow through from these legislative initiatives that were passed last year? Thank you.","Howard Nye","Kathryn, the short answer is, we are going to see it. Think about North Carolina, they have basically put in more money at the end of the year last year, and to be specific, that was an additional $700 million over two year. The other thing that North Carolina has that spending that we will see voted on later on the year. It's a $2 billion building bond proposed as well. So I think to answer your question very specifically, when our legislature came out with the additional $700 million, we did see the state implementation plan move forward 90 projects up into the year. So we do anticipate seeing that. So, yes, we are seeing activity that we believe will take aggregates volume later in the year. And clearly, what's effectively doubling the Georgia budget, adding that additional $900 million to it, we will clearly see amped up activity in Georgia.","Remember, we were going to be benefitted too by the [indiscernible] planning that was put in principally in South Georgia a couple of years ago. So now what we will see I believe, is greater activity across the State of Georgia buttressing the activity that we were seeing in South Georgia. Increased activity in North Georgia principally around Atlanta and we know we will see more activity in North Carolina as well. I think it's worth noting, Iowa did put in a $0.10 a gallon gas tax increase last year, Nebraska did as well. We are going to see the benefits of Prop 1 money in Texas and we are seeing near record lettings in Florida this year.","So we are seeing new money in a number of states and we think as we see more money coming in a number of states including states like Indiana where Governor Pence has basically said he would like to see another $1 billion put to infrastructure in that state. And we have got 12 different states right now seriously considering gas tax increases in addition to what Georgia and Iowa ask. So that gives you a little bit of a feel across the patch Kathryn.","Kathryn Thompson","And just to clarify. So if you look at all these initiatives in aggregate, are we in the early innings, middle innings, of seeing the dollars flow through? I would assume the early innings but you're the one in the field seeing the volumes flow through.","Howard Nye","No. Kathryn, we are in the early innings. And I think part of what you are seeing too, it's not just early innings. It's early innings of a different type of work. Think of it in these terms. For much of the last decade we have really been living more on private work than public work. And private work is not as aggregate intensive as public work is. And what we are seeing now is a transition away from repair and maintenance on public work to a very different type of public work that I do believe in the early innings of. And I think you and I both had to sense that the more that we are building new lanes, the more that we are building new highways or new roads and the more of these rural parts of the state are looking to add capacity and open up new lanes and corridors for business, that\u2019s awfully powerful to our business and I think very very much aggregate intensive. So early, yes, more aggregate intensive, yes.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. And then next two questions. One, I appreciate your giving some clarification on increasing your end market growth projections from Q3 but could you frame the outlook that accounts for the relatively large increase or improvement in the difference? And then the final question would be on cement margins. If you could just help us think about, it does look to be a big jump and maybe help us understand the improvement in cement margins. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Sure, Kathryn. Let's talk about the first part of your question first. I think what we are seeing is increased contracted backlogs across our entire footprint. We have also seen the awarding of several large energy related industrial contracts, particularly along the Gulf Coast. I think what we were seeing in the fourth quarter, when it wasn\u2019t raining the fourth quarter looked very powerful. I will give you a sense of that. I have been in Texas three times over the last month and a half and was down there for part of the holidays. And when I am talking to contractors in that marketplace, literally in the week of Christmas when it was dry, they were saying they were having really record days even at that time of the year, which I will tell you is unusual but guessing a sense of what's out there.","And the other point I think goes back to the very beginning of the conversation that we had and that\u2019s just simply more accelerated infrastructure activity in our key states. So we are looking at those $10.1 billion worth of activity potentially in Texas, more in North Carolina, more in Iowa and more in Colorado. And remember what we said about Colorado, the primary thing that was keeping us from doing more in Colorado, is we needed more business in Colorado. And now what we have been able to effectively do is extend our march down the front range into the southern part of that as well. So I think all those together has put us in a position that we feel considerably good about the way 2016 is shaping up.","I think as we go back to the second part of your question that is relative to cement. I think several things are going to happen. One, cement was badly affected last year by the rain. I mean it's hard to run a cement business which is a 24x7, 365 business, if you need to take it down more than you would wish. And keep in mind, our aim is to be a price leader in that state and our view was, we would rather take those kilns down rather than keep the kiln going and do something that we thought like was going to be foolish relative to the selling price in that market place. In large part we believe we are going to have greater efficiencies in cement this year but we also think we are going to see better pricing in cement this year.","You saw a little bit of share movement in our business in cement. And the fact is, we were willing to see that share movement move because that was really driven by two distinct players in the marketplace. Holcim had brought on a kiln, again, that they had idled for a while at Midlothian and they were coming back into the marketplace. And Argos, as we discussed, was bringing in some material into South Texas. We believe as we go into the year, that everybody is likely to be relatively full. We believe we are going to be efficient. We believe we are going to be successful on our pricing increases and we think by the time we put all of that in place, we are looking at very nice improvement in the cement business. And by the way, we are looking for a very nice improvement in the read mix business as well. I think those are your principal drivers in Texas.","Anne Lloyd","Kathryn, the only thing I would add is that when you are looking at comparability between 2015 and 2016, you have got to remember the impact of the California operations which were really still not at any kind of recovery trajectory.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets.","Adam Thalhimer","I wanted to ask first about incremental margins. You guys had very strong margins in 2015 but your guidance for 2016 is in the 55% to 65% range, incremental gross margins for aggregates. Is it possible you're being conservative there?","Howard Nye","No. We have always said that that was going to be on average, so we are really not changing what we said over time. Fairly we exceeded it in this last quarter. I think much of what we said in the past is that\u2019s what you are going to see on average across the enterprise. But we also said it would likely move much more aggressively if you saw growth coming in the eastern part of the United States, particularly in Mid Atlantic and southeast. And if you go back to really put some of those numbers look like they were most impressive. That\u2019s what you are seeing. And to answer your question specifically, I think we are going to see the eastern United States on a percentage basis growing in ways that we haven't seen over the last several years. That\u2019s certainly the indications that we are getting on activity on Georgia, and in Florida, and in South Carolina and in North Carolina. And I think the quick answer is Adam, if we see those areas of the country growing the way that we believe that they will, I will just say this much, the incremental margins will be a nice story again.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask on your end market outlook for 2016. The infrastructure piece and the non-res piece improved from what you said in early November. So I just wondered if you could expand on what got better, maybe it was just stuff that got pushed because of the weather.","Howard Nye","You know what, I think several things. Number one, we didn\u2019t have a highway bill when we were talking about it before. And I think the fact that the highway bill is actually spurring a lot of increased activity. I don\u2019t know how much of that\u2019s going to hit in the early part of '16 but I think you might see some of that actually coming through at the backend of '16, which would be earlier than you would typically see. But I think equally when you come back and consider the significant state initiatives, and again, we saw initiatives coming out of North Carolina late in the year. We are seeing a big Texas number. We are seeing that gas tax increase pull through in ways that we are excited about in Iowa. Again, another record, near-record letting year coming up in Florida.","I think all of that helps on the infrastructure side of it particularly. I think if we go to non-res, I mean here is statistic that\u2019s striking to me. Think of it in these terms. Shale volumes were down 1.1 million tons in the quarter, as you heard me say in the telecon. But net South Texas shipments actually increased and they increased by large infrastructure and large manufacturing projects. And part of what we are seeing on the non-res side is an awfully nice surge in non-building. So I would encourage you to go and take a look at what's going on in other non-building. Again, power plants, gas, communications, those types are really very aggregate intensive jobs. Non-building, looking at the trailing 12-months through November was up 19% and a lot of that activity is concentrated in the Gulf.","So, again, if we are coming back and seeing what we feel like a really, really attractive DOT projects and awfully nice non-res projects, that\u2019s helps. The other piece of it, candidly, we saw a lot of projects awarded in the fourth quarter and one of the things that I would like to see is at certain levels it's probably frustrating to our division presidents, but we have signed delegations from here to know exactly what they are bidding on. It's not that we don\u2019t trust what they are doing, we just like to see the sheer level of that activity and we saw a lot of that activity before.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil with Sterne Agee.","Todd Vencil","In the release, you guys said that your non-res market was 32% of your shipments in the fourth quarter and was up 3% for the year, and that light non-res was up 27% for the year. Can you split out light and heavy in terms of the volume split in the quarter and talk about which way each one went in the fourth quarter?","Howard Nye","You know, here's the easy way to think about that Todd. The primary thing that I want to think of on the heavy side is what was going on relative to shale. I mean that\u2019s really your show on what was going on on the heavy side. I mean to give you a sense of, to walk through the quarters, in Q1, to shale, we sold about 1.2 million tons. In Q2, to shale, we sold about 1 million. In Q3, to shale, about 830 and in Q4 to shale about 521. Remember in my prepared comments I said I thought we were getting to maintenance levels. We view that 500,000 tons a few quarter as a maintenance and that goes back in part to the comment that I think I was sharing with Adam before, when I said look, we saw shale volumes down 1.1 million tons in the quarter but South Texas shipments actually up. So if you go the one part of the country, they would have felt more acutely the downturn in shale than anybody else. And you brush it away and you say that their volumes were up. That gives you a good sense of what's happening on that lighter side of it, Todd. And then back to that non-building piece of it as well.","So the resilience that we are seeing there across our marketplace is pretty comforting to us right now. And we are liking what we are seeing. Does that help?","Todd Vencil","It does. It does. Thanks for that. Not to beat a dead horse, but just to make sure we're clarifying. If you think about the swing factor from the non-res outlook up slightly in the preliminary outlook that you gave back in November to the high single-digit growth that you're talking about today, a big swing factor, it seems like it's not only resilience there on the light side, but also the fact that there were some significant actual contract signings that you saw in the fourth quarter. Is that fair?","Howard Nye","That's very fair. It goes back to that notion that we talked about relative to delegations. We have been signing a lot of them. And the other thing is, number one, it's what we're seeing. And that's what's most important. Equally, it's awfully consistent with what FW Dodge is seeing. So if we look at their latest forecast which came out on January 26, they are seeing non-res up in those same types of percentages that we are talking about. So, again it's nice to see it. It's also nice to go to third parties and said that their data is saying the same thing that our life experience is saying.","Todd Vencil","Good. We like it when those things dovetail.","Howard Nye","It's a beautiful thing.","Todd Vencil","Given the rain in the fourth quarter, and I don't think you said this, how many tons do we think got pushed into 2016 from the fourth quarter?","Howard Nye","Todd, I think, let's just say for the year is probably somewhere around 3.5 million to 4 million tons. I think we have got the vast majority of that obviously being in Texas. I mean there are places in the Midwest, for example, Q4 was wet and we have always discussed the fact that agricultural lime can go if it's really cold but it doesn\u2019t go if it's really wet. So there was a lot of stone sales, principally in North Texas, that got deferred. There was ag lime that was deferred in Iowa. And, frankly, there was some stone deferral not to the same degree that we did in -- that we saw in Texas but we certainly saw some in the Carolinas. We mentioned the fact that we have had a quarry outside Columbia that had several billion gallons of water in it.","The other piece of our business, though, that was pretty profoundly affected by the rain was ready mix concrete. And obviously Denver was at some point affected by it, Texas was profoundly affected by it. And the fact is, we're expecting a much better year out of our ready mix business this year. If we get ready mix to the point over time that it's gotten margins like we're seeing in Denver, you're looking at $75 million extra that could come out of ready mix if we have those margins in Texas like we have in Denver. Now we are not looking for that -- up in the year and I think we will and we should. That\u2019s another nice swing factor, Todd.","Todd Vencil","Good. Thanks for that. Final one for me, and I don't want to get you too far out in front, but thinking a little bit longer term on the highway program and some of the comments you've made about it being early days and so on. With the visibility we have now, is it fair to think that we may be able to see a pick up in the growth rate on highway spending in '17 from '16?","Howard Nye","I think there is no question that it's likely that you will see that. Because, again, even in Texas when we are talking about $10 billion worth of lettings. A part of that work is going to be really not occurring in some respects until '17. You are still going to have Prop 1 monies even next year to the tune of probably $600 million or $700 million and then suddenly you are going to have the Prop 7 money coming into that. And then North Carolina was put in that extra $700 million over a couple of years to it. You are going to continue to have the gas tax hitting what's going on in Iowa. And the other thing that\u2019s important is you are seeing a number of TIFIA projects. Let's not forget that while TIFIA is smaller in this newest highway build, TIFIA isn't going away. And we are simply taking a look at what's going on in Colorado relative to, I think it was highway, Interstate 70 and Interstate 470. Those are two significant TIFIA projects that I think are like $1.7 billion to $2 billion.","To your point, I think this can be a good slow, steady build. One that the industry can meet but, two, fills I think an overhang of serious needs for long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace","What I was wondering, could you just -- I want to make sure I understood how to think about the 2016 guidance for cement in Texas. I know you've talked about ceding some share to some degree by design, but are we expecting to recapture all that share in 2016? I want to make sure we appreciate what drives the volume guidance that you've framed out.","Howard Nye","Yes. The fact is, our share has moved around a little bit from call it the high teens to low 20s. And the factors you are talking about, 2% or 3% share in that market place. The fact is, Ted, we really believe that the pricing in that market place is more important than the share that we have given in some respect there. The other thing that I have said to people before, we are very good cement operators in that marketplace and if we need to compete in a way to make sure that we are protecting share, we are certainly willing to do that. But at this point, today, I think we hold about 20.5% market share, that\u2019s a reduction of 2%. To put math to it, it's about $325,000 tons, just to be really granular. And again, I think we have got a good sense of where that breakpoint is between share and price and our sense has been, price has been more important and I think you can tell, given what we have done relative to the business, it has certainly shown that.","I mean one important thing to remember there is whether needs stabilize. And as it stabilizes, I think part of what's going to happen is the imports, in particular that were coming into South Texas that Argos is bringing in, will suddenly start to be utilized for their own self supply. And I think the heavy rain in that state last year and their inability to utilize it only for self-supply and going into the marketplace differently, was part of what we were seeing relative to the volumes and to the share loss, if that helps Ted.","Ted Grace","It does. But when we look at 8% to 11% volume growth, we should think about the large majority of that being underlying growth in the market that you participate in Texas?","Howard Nye","That\u2019s correct. And I would say, in particular in North Texas.","Ted Grace","Okay. And then the related question would be, I don\u2019t if it's for Ward or Anne, but when you bridge the gross profit improvement...","Howard Nye","The business, Ted?","Ted Grace","Yes, specific to the cement business.","Howard Nye","Okay. And again, we wish that was going to be up $30 million and the majority of that\u2019s likely going to be driven by the price component of it. But we are going to get efficiencies out of that business if we just had normal precipitation in that state, that would be pretty notable as well. I am not sure I have got a specific percentage breakdown on that. But I would say the pricing is going to be more notable in some respects than with the volume.","Ted Grace","Okay. And then the other thing I just want to ask quickly is, in terms of the contribution on the volume basis from the Colorado aggregate acquisitions, can you just give a sense of what those are going to bring on in terms of production or realized volumes in 2016?","Howard Nye","I can give you a sense of that. I mean we are looking for probably about 1.5 million tons out of that business. Again, what we picked up there, Ted, and what we are very careful that we are trying to do, it goes back to what we said out in our shore process. Our strategic planning. We wanted to make sure we had leading positions in attractive regions. That\u2019s what we have done. We wanted to make sure that we were getting generational types of deposits in those areas. That\u2019s what we have done with nearly 1 billion tons in that market place. Here is an important note for us to consider because we haven't had a reason to talk to you about this in the past, but actually in November, voters in Colorado Springs actually put in a sales and use tax increase of 0.62% to fund road repair and maintenance in that part of the state. We believe that\u2019s going to generate about $250 million over five years just in Southern Colorado.","So when we come back with what we feel like will be about net sales of that business of about $90 million. EBITDA margins of probably 17% to 20%, which is below where we would like to see it. It's actually better than the business that we bought in the Rocky Mountains when we acquired it and we brought it up with that very capable team that we have in Denver. I don\u2019t have any doubt that we will see those percentages move up nicely and move up, I think in trajectory in a much more quick timeframe then they did for us originally in Denver. Which by the way, I don\u2019t think anyone ever complained about. So, again, call it $90 million in net sales, EBITDA margins of 17%-20%, probably about 1.5 million tons of [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question comes from James Armstrong with Vertical Research.","James Armstrong","The first one is, could you help us understand how to get comfortable with the 7% pricing guidance for 2016? Specifically, do you have any contracts in hand that really lead you to believe that the 7% in aggregates is in hand and with the type of volume you're talking about, could it be conservative?","Howard Nye","You know what, I guess what I would say is this. The wonderful thing about the pricing story in our industry is that I think this has held together so remarkably well, all the way through a downturn. Our sense has long been that as we hit an upturn, the pricing story works even better. I think that\u2019s what we are seeing. I think the other thing that I would say is one of the earlier comments I made was, we see that eastern United States recovering now at a faster rate than we have seen for a while. Eastern quarries are higher priced quarries. So I guess what I would say is this, to your question very specifically, James.","I don\u2019t have any concerns about being able to at least make sure we get our pricing. If I worry about things, if I have got a worrying list from 1 to 100, I will put pricing clearly at 101. So I have got a lot of confidence around that. And, again, depending on what's some of the geographic mix looks like, I will leave it to your observations on whether there could be upside in that but we certainly put a range out there that we have a degree of confidence on.","James Armstrong","That helps. Two follow ups. Are you seeing any ability to ship further as diesel prices fall?","Howard Nye","You know, I am sure people could. Here's what I think is more of an issue. I think the barriers to entry and the regulatory environment in which we operate have gotten so difficult that the notion of trying to ship product farther and deplete quarries faster is not something that I think most competitors are interest in doing. So I think with cheaper diesel, could it happen? I suppose math could say it could happen. Are we seeing that and can I go to specific markets and call it out as instances where I am concerned about it? Not really at all. I think the other practical matter is two-fold. One, people are having a hard time getting drivers in the marketplace. Just finding them. And then number two, actually paying for them on the wages that they are looking for.","So I think you have got an industry issue relative to aggregates that I think makes taking cheaper diesel and hauling stone further a bit of an anathema. And then I think you have also got a driver situation that makes it even more of a challenge. So today not an issue and really would not anticipate it being an issue this year.","James Armstrong","That helps. And then lastly, is there a debt level you're comfortable at? And at what debt level to EBITDA ratio would you be comfortable taking out to buy back stock?","Howard Nye","Let me turn to Anne to talk about.","Anne Lloyd","James, as we have indicated pretty consistently, we have said we would keep a minimum two times debt to EBITDA. Obviously at the end of 2015 we ended at a net debt of 1.9 times. We have indicated we would keep that level of debt and then that we would continue to use excess cash over and above what we use both for organic and inorganic capital and use that in the form to buy back shares during the course of the year. So therefore, I think if you could think about it that we likely are much more active in that market as we move through the second quarter and into the second half of the year. As we have indicated in the press release, we have used our available funds to produce some acquisitions in the business.","Howard Nye","You know, James, one thing to remember. We like these acquisitions we have just done in Denver a lot. The other thing that we will say is, we like ourselves a lot. We feel like we have got a good business. So the fact is we believe this business continues to delever very, very quickly. And if we like ourselves when we are $30 a share higher than we are now, so we really like ourselves a lot right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research.","Garik Shmois","First question is on your cement pricing guidance. I'm just wondering if you can talk about how much of the price improvement that you're anticipating in 2016 is driven by improved mix in the lower priced TXI contracts rolling off as opposed to securing a meaningful portion of the April price increase. Because as we think about cement pricing in general, correct me if I'm wrong, it does take a little bit of time to be fully realized in earnings. So, I'm just wondering if you can walk us through the price progression in 2016 and the different components.","Howard Nye","Garik, you said it exactly right. Number one, to go back to your initial question. Really, almost all of the legacy TXI facilities, those contracts are gone. So in large part what we are talking about here on these price increases, are real price increases. And that\u2019s what we anticipate putting into the marketplace, in North Texas and South Texas. Now, again, I think it's going to be easier in many respects to get price in North Texas than in South Texas. So I think we will see it in both. I think we will get it in both but it is going to be easier in North. And I agree with you as well, we are going to have some of our own contracts that we need to work through. And part of what I have try to do in the telecon is give some color around how that would play out over the year and put some specific percentages to it. But I mean, would we go in and put all dollars across the board on everything this year? No, we won't because we do have to work through our own. But at least at this point, Garik, it is our own contracts that we are working off and not TXI legacy contracts. Does that help?","Garik Shmois","Yes. It does.","Anne Lloyd","And you can see Garik where the pricing is at the end of 2015 such that by the end of the year, the guidance that we have provided you on average selling price per ton is kind of give you a sense of the trajectory of realization through the course of the year.","Garik Shmois","Yes, of course. Thank you for that. Two more questions, if I could. Just a point of clarification on the volumes that you picked up, the 1.5 million tons in Colorado. Just want to make clear that whether or not that is included in your volume guidance for the full year, the 164 million to 167 million tons.","Howard Nye","Short answer is, no, it's not, Garik.","Garik Shmois","Okay. And then lastly, in magnesia specialties, this is calling for growth in 2016. Fourth quarter did see some deceleration, steel markets remain challenged. Just wondering if you could walk us through your underlying assumptions in that business and what gives you the confidence that the market will turn around?","Howard Nye","Now, I guess a couple of things. One, if we are looking at where the American Iron and Steel Institute is right now relative to their forecast, they are basically seeing steel at a 70% utilization rate. And if you recall going back over time, that\u2019s been the point that we said was really an important one for this business. So if we are 70% or more, the business is going to do quite well. The other input that\u2019s important to remember is we are going to end up having a decent amount of usage of natural gas in that business. If we look at what Nat gas did last year for the year, is 28% lower. Even if we look for the quarter, it was about 26% lower. So, again, if we are going into the year and the Steel Institute is right, it's 70%, that\u2019s hitting a magic number. If the input on gas is going to continue to be low, that's helpful.","To the extent that that business comes under pressure, the thing that I would tell you too is, there is no team that we have in this company that\u2019s better at managing costs and managing their cost profile in our magnesia specialties business. So when I go back to Q4 and look at a 35% margin, even if that business came under some degree of duress, and again I am not thinking that it will but even if it did, I think you are looking at a business that\u2019s still going to have a margin in the low 30s. And from where I am sitting, if we have got a low 30 margin, I will take it as a [gain] [ph].","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms with Stephens.","Trey Grooms","So with the pent-up demand that you were talking about from weather, how quickly could that come through, Ward? Should that impact 1Q or, really just trying to think about quarterly cadence of volume.","Howard Nye","You know, I guess I would think of it in these terms. Could it affect Q1? I suppose it could affect Q1. But remember what we've always said about Q1. Q1 is either made or broken in the last two weeks of March in most instances. Because you've got to have relatively warm weather to put down hot mix in most markets. The other thing to remember, and we tried to outline it pretty clearly in the telecon, we are going to have that shale headwind at least in the Southwest throughout the first half of the year. But I think that clearly goes away once we're through with the first half. That said, here's a good way to think of it. If you want to look at the midpoint of our guidance, what you're really saying is you're going to have aggregate volume at the midpoint at about 166 million tons. I mean that's my quick math. If we want to say there with weather deferral of, call it 3.5 million, 4 million tons, then you've got the shale maintenance level that could take you down another 1.5 million tons in that first half.","And then the other component that we're managing through, and we'll manage through it it'll be just Fine, it's that transition from New Braunfels to Hunter. And any time you do a shift like that, it's never going to be a perfect handoff. There's going to be a little bit of shuffling that goes on because you're going from one large quarry to another large quarry. So as I look at that and start tallying it all up, I could see 2016 Ag volume at that 7% end of our range, 167 million tons. And could you see some of that go in Q1? You could but you do have that shale play that I would just encourage you to be mindful of during the first half of the year. So if you think about it, Trey, last year Q1 was a pretty good quarter. Q2 was a rainy mess. Q3 was relatively normal weather and I think the performance we saw in Q3 was what you would expect. And then Q4 we went back to building the ark. So the fact is, if we end up with a good Q1 in normal weather, I think we would be very very pleased with that given what will be just the optical headwind on that portion of shale. Does that help?","Trey Grooms","Yes, absolutely. Very helpful color. Thank you, Ward. And then on ready mix, you mentioned a couple of times that you're expecting a much better year for ready mix. That segment's already -- well, the downstream is already putting up some pretty good margins. What's driving the big margin improvement you're expecting there specifically in ready mix? Is that primarily material spread improvement, or are there other drivers there that could be moving the needle?","Howard Nye","You know what, it's going to be spread, it's going to be primarily efficiencies. It's going to be more volume. The fact is, you could see, probably 900,000 cubic yards more volume in that business in Texas than we saw last year. I think the other piece of it is, part of what we're seeing on some contracts now that are coming in in that South Texas area. We have talked about those large projects, like [indiscernible] and others. So the fact is, we'll see what we feel like is a good bit of that going this year as well. I think just better cost, better efficiency. Here's an interesting anecdote for you, Trey. I mean at some point late in the fourth quarter, we actually got a call here in the corporate office. And we got a call from this poor guy who is trying to build a hotel and get concrete poured because he's opening the doors the next week and he couldn't get concrete poured. And here's why he couldn't get concrete poured. Because the four other times we have been ready to deliver concrete to the site, he couldn't take it because the site was so wet. That's the type of backlog and back-build that we see in that business. So, that type of carryover, much better efficiency, new contracts going and what we think will be continued price leadership in that market gives us the type of confidence we have in ready mix.","Trey Grooms","That's very encouraging. Last one from me. On the share movement you mentioned in cement, the 325,000 tons, do you feel like that has pretty well run its course? I know the TXI legacy contracts have all rolled off. Do you feel like that's pretty well behind us at this point?","Howard Nye","You know what, I think we're working our way through that. I think that -- and I've always thought probably by the time we got to the end of Q1, it will have shaken itself out. The fact is, I go back in time and reflect on what TXI had done when they brought on more capacity prior to our ownership and then that worked itself out as well. Candidly, I think that's a little bit of what we've seen, particularly in North Texas. And I think to the extent that Argos really becomes more of a self supplier with their own cement in South Texas, I think those two bring the type of stabilizing effect that I would expect in both of those markets this year.","Trey Grooms","So, you still think kind of end of Q1, is the target on that?","Howard Nye","Yes. I do.","Trey Grooms","Okay. And just if I could sneak one more in for Anne. Just kind of housekeeping here for modeling. The $102.44 you announced on cement pricing for the quarter, is that basically where you ended the quarter for pricing there in cement?","Anne Lloyd","Effectively, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America.","Timna Tanners","I wanted to just touch base on the additional cement risk potential if the dollar continues to strengthen. How would you frame that risk or what extent do you see there?","Howard Nye","You know what, I've got to tell you, I don't see the dollar strength as really being a big component of that. I mean most of the imports that could come into Texas are coming in through Texas through people who are domestic producers there. Argos is the exception, and Argos has really tapped out at 500,000 tons coming in through Houston. So, I don't see that as really something that I believe would be a driving force in that market, Timna.","Timna Tanners","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then I know you talked a lot about M&A being an important focus as of the investor day and I just wonder if you could update us on how you're seeing opportunities there. Valuations, appetite? And if you would have to expand from your current geographies or if there's more opportunities from where you're already positioned.","Howard Nye","I guess, what I would say is there continues to be a lot of just broad, general activity in M&A, period. I think we're seeing more approaches and we're having more approaches to others than we've seen in a while. I would expect that to persist. I think the notion of private companies seeing, hey, I've got a five year highway bill, it looks more aggregate intensive. This is probably not a bad place for us to ask somebody to jump off on a modeling tour. In their minds it's probably not a bad place to be. Part of what I liked about the deals that we've just done is we were able to do those within EBITDA multiple ranges that make a lot of sense for our business. We are picking up hard rock reserves at the end of the day for what we feel like could be tonnage prices at times for sand and gravel type reserves.","You shouldn't expect us to be looking at M&A in marketplaces that really are outside of where we are, unless we have the ability to go into a new marketplace either as a leader or with what we feel like is a clear executable plan to be a leader. And what I would always draw you back to, is what we did in Colorado in 2011. We went into that market with the swap that we did with Lafarge and the other transactions that we did literally back to back, and put ourselves overnight in a leadership position and really have extended that march with this latest transaction. But going into an attractive market and being a onesy-twosy in it and really not having a good way to become a leader in that marketplace, is not consistent with our strategy. So I wanted to articulate that to you because as you watch for us to grow, those really should be the boundaries to it.","Timna Tanners","Got it. Okay. And the last one, if I could. I just want to clarify what you said. I was confused on the magnesia specialties segment because utilization lately in steel saw another like 72% as of last year and it's 72% or so now. So is it fair to say that at the same utilization you would make the same profits or is there other driving forces that we should be aware of?","Howard Nye","No, the same utilization, would be the same profit. I guess what I'm saying, last year -we've got to be careful when I say last year because we're between years...","Anne Lloyd","2015.","Howard Nye","In 2014, it was 78%. In 2015, it was 72%. So, what we're saying is, we think it's probably going to be around that 70%. That's certainly what we are hearing right now. And if it stays there, we're going to see something that feels relatively consistent. I think, back to your question, Timna.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Brandon Jaffe","This is actually Brandon Jaffe on behalf of Jerry. Can you talk about how aggregates price increases for January 1 this year compare to last year and maybe how you expect the pricing cadence to play out? If I'm not mistaken, you had a bigger January 1 increase last year than typical seasonality would suggest, and also you had lower mid-year prices throughout the year.","Howard Nye","Well, What I would tell you is, we've gone to the market pretty consistently with what we feel like the pricing needs to be. And I've seen pricing anywhere on the low end from $0.50 a ton to the middle range of about $1 a ton to in some places $1.50 a ton, or more in some instances. I think one of the best examples that I can give you, if you go back to when we did our acquisition of TXI. Part of what we said was TXI's pricing was roughly 60% of our corporate average and we said we thought it would probably take about three years to get that closer to our corporate average. Mindful that our corporate average continues to move up during that same period of time. Right now, TXI is about 75% of our corporate average.","So again, from a rhythm and cadence perspective, that's certainly what we're seeing. Would I expect us to come back and talk about mid-year price increases again this year? The short answer is I would. If we're seeing the types of volume increases and the more infrastructure type work, honestly, I think you could find yourself in a position toward the latter part of '16, certainly in '17 that in some markets you could be short on some products. That was exactly what happened last year, principally because of flooding in North Texas with respect to sand in particular. Again, I think the rhythm of it will be, you'll see most prices in effect January 1. In some places, you're going to see some pricing that won't go into effect until March or April. The long and short answer is, that doesn't so much matter because there's not a lot of volume going on in Q1 anyway. And we will come back at some point later in the year and talk to you more about mid-year price increases but I think customers should expect those conversations.","Brandon Jaffe","Great. And then on the TXI cement business, now that you've had more time to run those assets, can you talk about the opportunities you see there to invest in that business? And maybe update us on the cement CapEx plans currently compared to what you laid out at the last analyst day?","Howard Nye","No, I don't think the CapEx plans have changed materially since the last analyst day. I mean part of what we said that we could do, and we were talking at that point not just about the Texas plants, we were talking about California plants as well, because we were saying that we could take our capacity up over time. And, clearly, we're still believing that that's going to be the case. This year in Texas, we're probably looking, I'm trying to remember exactly what we're looking at for -- try to give me one second on the additions this year -- I'm going to have to come back and probably talk to you about that offline.","Brandon Jaffe","No problem.","Howard Nye","But, really, if we're looking, I can give you a good sense of what we're looking at on the kiln expenses for the year. That's probably a very worthy number for you to have right now. So if we're looking at kiln expenses for the year on downtime, and these are important numbers, we're looking probably in Q1 at about $6.6 million. We're looking in Q2 at about $3.7 million. We're looking in Q3 at about $2 million. And Q4 is always the heavy quarter, that's going to be right at almost $11 million-$10.9 million. And I now have found what I was looking for. I apologize for that delay. Relative to capital, what we had said we would do, is we would add some additions because of capital in 2015 and add about 200,000 additional tons at Hunter and about 50,000 additional tons at Midlothian. And then what we had spelled out at analyst day and beyond is that we thought we would come back in '16, and these are in our capital plans by the way, and add an additional 140,000 tons at Hunter, again, that's in San Antonio. Which brings you, if we're looking 2017 through the additional tonnage that we're looking to add, it would put us at capacity in Texas of 4.75 million tons. So, there's your build.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays.","Stephen Kim","Most of my questions have been answered. But earlier in the year, we heard you guys talking about labor constraints, particularly on the ready mix side. And I guess with all the rainy weather, it really wasn't much of an issue. But I was curious if you had any insight into how that situation has developed. Has it improved, do you sense? Because I assume that part of the 3.5 million-4 million catch up or deferment into Q1 would presume that you're going to be able to see some of those labor constraints to not return or intensify. So, could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there on the labor side?","Howard Nye","Sure. I mean if you go back particularly in Texas and then look at what was going on in that marketplace, a lot of it tied back into what we talked about earlier, and that is simply what's going on with drivers or what's not going on with drivers. So a lot of drivers were, frankly, engaged in what was going on in the shale fields at the time. What's happening now is you've got more drivers who are available. But here's the other piece of it that's important, and we went through this very carefully last October when we were going through our planning cycle. Our two ready mix businesses are in Colorado and Texas and what we were hearing from both of those groups is, if we could get more trucks, then we would have the ability to come back and safely serve the market in the most efficient way that we could. And the short answer is, at this point we think we're able to, one, put more trucks in, in a thoughtful way. Number two, put drivers in those trucks, and three, be in a position, both in the Rocky Mountains as well as in the Metroplex, and I think that's going to be the primary marketplace that delivery can be tight at times.","So, I do think from a capital perspective we're where we need to be. And I do think from a labor perspective, it's going to feel in our world much better in 2016 than it did in 2015. In large part, if you just look at the rhythm and the cadence of what has happened in those shale fields. Remember what we were talking about in some of the earlier conversations about what it looked like last year, Q1 in the shale fields and what it looks like this year. And I think we'll certainly be able to meet that demand.","Stephen Kim","Got it. That's very helpful. Then, just lastly, I know that resi isn't a super high percentage of your business but it's still almost 20%, I would guess. You talked a little bit about, I think you put double-digit type numbers that you're forecasting and I think you talked about reference permits being strong. Obviously in Texas, I was curious, there's some concerns obviously about what permits might do in Texas. If you could just talk a little bit about what your guidance is assuming in terms of permit activity in Texas.","Howard Nye","Let's talk about it in a number of different ways. Number one, permit activity that we see are up 12%, starts are up 11% and completions up 9%. So, you've still got more starts than completions, which we feel like is an attractive place to be. I think as we look at what most forecasts are saying for 2016, they are looking for starts up around, I think 1.25 million starts number. That's up around 13%. I think most people, now this is getting farther out, are looking for starts to be up another 10% even as we go into '17. So if we look at Texas, more specifically to your question, Texas ranked number four in housing permit activity. Dallas\/Fort Worth, which is our single largest market in Texas, is ranking second in housing permits and to us that continues to indicate good future strength in that market.","The other thing that's remarkable to look at, if you look at residential units in 2015 in Dallas, what I'm seeing is data that reveals there's about 43,000 unit starts. If you look at Houston's Sugar Land, there's around 51,000 starts. You put those two together, that's almost 10% of total starts in the United States. And we're not seeing any slowdown in North Texas at all right now. And the fact is, housing inventory in Houston is still at about four months.","Anne Lloyd","And, Stephen, I would just add just as a point of clarification, residential is about 15% of our end use which is actually a very healthy percentage. At prior peak we knocked on the door of 20%, 22%, which kicked it a little bit out of balance. So, we feel like we're still in that, quite honestly, good sweet spot in the residential activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Betts with Jefferies.","Mike Betts","The only question I've got left is on the asphalt and I guess it's a two or three parter. You've obviously sold the San Antonio asphalt business. I see that volumes are down 45% in Q4 in the external sales in asphalt. Is that entirely due to that disposal or is that due to weather or contracts ending or anything like that? I guess, what I'm really after is some guidance as to how much volume has gone with that disposal for the nine months that won't be in the next year. And then just finally on the asphalt business, can you talk about the strategy for what you've got left there? I mean are you looking to exit it because it is quite small now.","Howard Nye","Mike, thanks for your question. A couple of things that I would say. A few years ago, we had an asphalt business in Arkansas which we no longer have. So that was sold about a year and a half ago. Number two, what we did sell was basically an FOB asphalt business that was in San Antonio. Here's the quick answer on that. We weren't the best owner of it. We did with asphalt in San Antonio exactly what we did with cement in California. Somebody else was a better owner. It was not core to us in that marketplace. So we sold it. From a tonnage perspective, you're probably looking somewhere, let's call it 700,000 tons a year. So the single biggest piece of our asphalt business is in Denver, and to Denver it is very much a core part of our business there. And the asphalt business does very well in Denver. So we do see it as core in that marketplace because that's the way that marketplace is built up and down the Front Range. So people tend to be in aggregates, they tend to be in ready mix and they tend to be in hot mix. We don't see it changing in that part of the world. And as we sit here today, Mike, that's the only place that we have asphalt left.","Mike Betts","So the acquisition in Colorado, will that add further significant asphalt volumes?","Howard Nye","It does add some asphalt volume. Again, it tends to be an aggregates led business. You're looking at probably about 340,000 tons in that southern Front Range marketplace that came with these transactions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities.","Craig Bibb","Congratulations on opening the Medina quarry. That's a big deal. Could you give us a little color on the impact on production volume, profitability both in '16 and beyond?","Howard Nye","You know what as we said, that's going to be about 6 million tons coming out of there. It's the largest quarry in the UP network. It's going to be going principally into Houston and South Texas. The primary issue that you've got there is that's going to be an area of the state that's going to be starved for DOT specification stone. So number one, it's going to be a highly efficient operation to get material to that part of the state for a long time. The other thing that it does, Craig, and this is important, if you ever fly into San Antonio, you're going to fly right over our Beckman quarry. Beckman, for several times over the last decade has been the largest producing quarry in the United States and it's almost situated in Metro San Antonio. And here's something I think most people don't appreciate, San Antonio's actually the second largest city in Texas. Houston is largest. San Antonio is number two. San Antonio is larger than Dallas. And our aim was to make sure we were utilizing Beckman quarry, which is really a diamond, in the most efficient way for that quarry and to make sure we've got that quarry there for another 20-plus years. And we were also in a position to make sure that we could feed South Texas in the most efficient fashion and thus the move to Medina. So that's probably a little bit more than you were looking for, Craig, but again, the strategy and the operations around it are important. What I can tell you is that plant opened on the day that we expected that plant to open. Railcars are going out of there on the day that we expected them to go. As you recall, we've got several hundred car unit facilities not just in Houston but throughout South Texas and that's where that material is going.","Anne Lloyd","And just as a point of clarification, Craig. As Ward indicated in the teleconference script, that 6 million tons is actually just replacing tonnage. We're going to lower the tonnage at the Beckman quarry and move it through Medina. And as you look forward, that Medina quarry is capable of producing up to 10 million tons but that is probably a couple years out.","Craig Bibb","How many years of reserves are left at Beckman? I mean are we...","Howard Nye","We would expect to be at Beckman for another couple of decades.","Craig Bibb","Okay. You often highlight Georgia as an area where you dramatically added to your asset base during the downturn. I think Vulcan mentioned something like 22% same store volume in Georgia. Could you maybe give us a little more color there? It looks like there could be a lot of leverage.","Howard Nye","What I'll tell you is, it's funny to look at some of those numbers because the numbers look and feel awfully familiar. So what I would tell you is that what I read in the transcript from Vulcan relative to Georgia looked very similar. I think we saw them up 23%ish.","Craig Bibb","Okay. And then lastly, with magnesia specialty, what happens if utilization falls below 70%?","Howard Nye","Then I think what you'll see is they will go into another mode of cost containment. And I think that really goes back to the point that I was raising before. Maybe you go from mid-30s to low 30s or high 20s on the gross margin. Still, a very very attractive business even if that occurs.","Operator","And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Nye.","Howard Nye","Thanks again for joining our fourth quarter and full year earnings call. Again, we are confident entering 2016, as I hope you can glean from our comments.

And welcome to the Martin Marietta Materials Inc. Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, today\u2019s program is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s program, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead sir.","Ward Nye - Chairman and CEO","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining Martin Marietta\u2019s quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The results we reported for the third quarter 2014 reflect the successful TXI acquisition and frankly underscores the value and timing of the transaction. Bringing TXI into Martin Marietta not only continues to enhance our overall presence in the Western United States, but importantly augments our significant heritage position in Texas, which as you know, leads the nation in job growth, a clear stimulus for construction activity.","Texas is also operating with the robust department of transportation budget having embraced alternative financing with the vision and vigor unlike any other. Allowing the state to commit to numerous major multi-year projects that should benefit our business in 2015 and beyond.","To give you some examples of the value of TXI, the acquired operations contributed $274 million of net sales, an increase of 53% and $44.5 million of adjusted gross profit to our third quarter results. And for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we generated $202 million of operating cash flow compared with $166 million for the prior year period. But what are the initial and clinical takeaways, we view them largely as four-fold.","First, the acquired operations provide a powerful complement to our strong heritage business and has Martin Marietta ready to supply the increasing demand for building materials. Second, by our refinancing of TXI\u2019s public debt, we\u2019re now positioned to reduce legacy TXI\u2019s annual interest expense by $34 million. Third, our original estimates of synergies of $70 million every three years now seeing too low and too slow. We anticipate doing considerably better. Finally, the $400 million of NOL carryforwards we originally estimated have increased by nearly $100 million. We\u2019ll discuss the specifics of all of these value enhancing factors and more during this teleconference.","Additionally, we\u2019re also pleased to see increased demand in our heritage business during the third quarter resulting in 130 basis point expansion of our consolidated gross margin. This improvement was driven by volume and pricing growth in our aggregates product line, despite costs in various inefficiency headwinds from rail transportation. Further, the specialty products business contributed record third quarter net sales and earnings from operation.","Before discussing the quarterly results further, as a reminder, today\u2019s teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance like other businesses, which subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise.","We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","As a preface, let me offer that it\u2019s not easy to fully understand, calibrate and compare this quarter\u2019s results with other periods due to the TXI acquisition as well as TXI related non-recurring items. Simple comparisons to prior periods for either Martin Marietta or legacy TXI will not provide an adequate understanding of a business that\u2019s been transformed with a 53% increase in net sales. That said, we classified legacy TXI reporting to conform to Martin Marietta. As a result of the reclassification and the impact of business combination accounting, direct comparison to legacy TXI\u2019s publicly available data from prior years does not reflect same-on-same performance results. In addition, because TXI\u2019s fiscal year ended May 31 whereas ours in December 31, the reporting periods are not the same. Still we have provided reference to prior year legacy TXI data where relevant to the understanding of the underlying business. So on today\u2019s call and in future presentations we\u2019ll be making, we will endeavor to be as transparent as possible so you can more easily track and evaluate our progress.","In our earnings release and in the charts made available, both during this webcast and on our website, we supplied supplemental financial information through the lens we used to analyze the business in light of the TXI acquisition. First, as detailed on slide two, our heritage Martin Marietta business which includes specialty products provides same on same comparison to the prior year third quarter; second, as detailed on slide four, our acquired operation including a view of performance in the acquired business\u2019s product lines and finally, we provide an overview of TXI related and non-recurring items. We believe this approach provides meaningful data and makes the performance in our business more transparent for the quarter.","Let\u2019s begin with the look at our EPS. Consensus estimates vary considerably, as analysts attempted to predict the impact of the TXI acquisition on quarterly results. Based on Wall Street\u2019s estimates as reported by first call, we believe two key differences totaling $0.17 reconcile these estimates to reported EPS. First, analysts assumed weighted average outstanding shares of 62.6 million versus a reported 67.5 million. This alone reduced EPS by $0.07. The 67.5 million shares include shares issued in the acquisition as well as the impact of conversion of TXI stock-based awards.","Second, business combination accounting rules dictated a fair value markup of acquired aggregates and cement inventory effectively eliminating nearly $11 million of profit in inventory sold during the third quarter, a $0.10 per share negative impact on EPS.","Next, let\u2019s review our heritage Martin Marietta business. Slide 3 provides you key metrics for our heritage operation. Our aggregates business continues to improve led by robust activity in our West Group primarily in Texas and Colorado. Aggregates product line shipments in the West Group increased more than 5%. Notably aggregates volumes in the West Group would have increased 9% over the prior year quarter if the required TXI-related divestiture had been included for the full three month period.","The Midwest and Eastern part of the country was negatively affected by unseasonably wet weather during the quarter. Notwithstanding this short-term impact, we are seeing signs of increased South Eastern construction activity led by job growth in Atlanta, Georgia and Florida, as well as TIFIA-supported infrastructure projects.","Heritage aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in our three largest end use markets. The infrastructure market represented 47% of quarterly volumes and shipments to the sector increased 3%. Public-sector work in Texas includes the benefits of nearly $20 billion of construction investment from 2013 through 2015.","We recently began serving the interstate 35 East project in Dallas and are positioned to serve upcoming sections of the TIFIA funded Grand Parkway project in Houston. The East and other major projects have contributed to a multi-year backlog in Texas.","Colorado is also experiencing growth driven by the responsible acceleration of maintenance and partnerships or RAMP program, as well as reconstruction work resulting from last year\u2019s flooding. For the quarter, infrastructure shipments in Colorado were up more than 20% over the prior year period.","During the quarter, Congress passed an extension of MAP-21 through May 31, 2015 and also authorized $11 billion of transfers to maintain the High Way Trust Fund solvency. We believe these are the first steps toward reauthorization of a multi-year federal highway bill.","The non-residential end-use market represented 30% of quarterly heritage volume since shipments increased 3% over the prior year quarter. Growth was driven by shipments to support shale energy expansion projects notably in South Texas. Recently, there have been market concerns about the sustainability of these projects primarily due to the decline in the global price of oil.","However, there are over $100 billion of anticipated energy projects along the Gulf Coast and over $1 billion of needed infrastructure repairs on roads damaged by heavy construction vehicles used in energy projects over the past several years. Early portion of this repair work are now underway.","Given this level of ongoing activity, we expect the ramping up in construction materials demand for these projects. Consistent with that expectation, on the November 2014 ballet, the Texas legislature has advanced Proposition 1. Our proposed constitutional amendment who directs needed road repairs. If approved by the voters, Proposition 1 would authorize annual disbursements from the state\u2019s existing oil and gas production tax collections to the state highway fund, an estimated $1.7 billion will be transferred in the first year alone. Current polling data indicates Proposition 1 is expected to pass in next week\u2019s elections.","The residential end-use market represented 14% of quarterly heritage aggregates product line volumes and shipments increased 9% over the prior year quarter. We experienced significant residential construction growth in our western markets in direct contrast to national trends. By way of example, for the trailing 12 months ending September 30, 2014, residential starts were up 31% in San Antonio, 11% in both Houston and Austin and 27% in Fort Collins, Colorado along the front range north of Denver. This reaffirms our view for the value of the company\u2019s strategic growth initiatives made over the past several years which should continue to benefit our future demand.","Finally, to conclude the discussion of end-use markets. The ChemRock and Rail market representing the remaining 9% of our heritage aggregate product line volume and shipments declined 9% versus the prior year quarter. The performance of Class 1 railroads both in terms of capital maintenance and operational efficiency has led to continued weakness in balanced sales and is the primary driver for the decrease in shipments.","Heritage aggregates product line pricing remained strong and we were pleased to achieve increases in each geographic group. Prices increased 5% over the prior year quarter led by an 8% increase in the West Group. Product mix did not have a material impact on the quarterly pricing comparison.","Aggregates\u2019 product line production increased 4% response to higher demand. However, direct production cost per ton increased slightly as greater leverage was offset by higher repair and supply costs and the productivity impact of certain weather constraints. Cost of sales was also negatively affected by higher transportation costs related to our long-haul distribution network, principally rail inefficiencies.","We estimate that these increased third quarter costs to be over $12.7 million, a cost headwind likely to continue in the fourth quarter. However, energy costs, which were essentially flat during the quarter should mitigate ongoing production costs as the effect of declining diesel fuel prices work through the business.","The heritage aggregates-related downstream product lines provided an enhanced quarterly contribution. The ready mixed concrete product line experienced volume and pricing increases of 17% and 14% respectively which led to an 840 basis-point increase in the product line gross margin. Additionally, the asphalt business reported 13% increase in net sales.","Gross profit for the heritage aggregates business increased 16% to over $142 million, yielding a gross margin percentage to net sales of 24.3%, an improvement of 170 basis points from the prior year quarter. The incremental contribution from each dollar of net sales would have been in line with stated expectations excluding the impact of higher rail transportation costs.","Our Specialty Products business again posted strong quarterly results, delivering record net sales of $58.7 million and the gross margin of 34%. The business contributed earnings from operations of $17.7 million also a third quarter record.","The first 90 days post TXI acquisition have been both busy and invigorating. Our aggregates and ready mixed concrete operations teams have worked diligently on integration into the existing West Group structure. Specifically, we completed the back office integration of the aggregates business, including closing our former district conference in Lewisville, Texas as well as moving to Southwest division\u2019s leadership team from San Antonio. Both groups have relocated to TXI\u2019s former Dallas headquarters. Simultaneously, our cement group team also based in our Dallas office has been refining the sales and operational strategies of that business.","We plan to complete systems integration for the cement and ready mixed concrete businesses no later than June 2015. Accordingly and as planned, certain deflective corporate overhead costs will continue through that time.","We\u2019re pleased with the progress to-date and are especially proud of the response from the combined workforce as we forward to new unified accountability and performance culture on every front. Leading the safety through operational and profitability expectations. Our team is energized and enthusiastic about solidifying the foundation for future growth and shareholder return.","A key area of focus is increasing and accelerating the synergistic value of the acquisition. When we announced our planned acquisition of TXI, we said that we expected annual synergies of $70 million by 2017. We were conservative in our estimates. As our integration efforts progressed, we now expect synergies will be higher and the benefits will occur sooner than originally expected. Over the next few years, we also fully anticipate utilizing the income tax benefits from legacy TXI\u2019s, net operating loss carry-forwards as well as incremental value from the expected divestiture of identifying non-operating real estate asset.","After completing initial estimates of legacy TXI\u2019s fiscal year 2014 tax provision, the NOLs now exceed $500 million, also the completed refinancing of legacy TXI\u2019s outstanding debt is expected to reduce annual interest expense by $34 million based on current interest rates. This amount is incremental to the previously stated synergy target.","Slides four and five provides you financial information and key metrics for our required operations. The acquired aggregates business reported net sales of nearly $37 million on shipments of 3.2 million tons. Average selling price was $11.83 per ton driven by increased rail distribution yard and sand and gravel shipments.","After adjustment for the non-recurring impact of the mark-up of inventory to fair value during the quarter, the acquired aggregates business generated $8 million of gross profit, a 21% adjusted gross margin. Performance in the aggregates business should improved at an accelerated pace given the strength of the underlying market demand coupled with synergy expectations.","The acquired ready mix concrete business shipped 1.5 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $86.10. When compared to the legacy TXI quarter ended August 31, 2013, shipments increased 20% and pricing when adjusted for comparable legacy TXI presentation increased 4.5%.","The business contributed nearly $10 million of gross profit. A $6 per cubic yard price increase was announced in the North Texas market on August 1st. The full realization of this increase will likely take six months as we work through the current backlog.","As a reminder, we acquired a leading position in the Texas cement markets and a state-of-the-art rail-located cement plant in Southern California. These plants produced Portland and Specialty Cements with a combined annual capacity of 6.6 million tons, as well as the current permit that provides an 800,000 ton expansion opportunity at Midlothian plant near DSW.","As discussed earlier, the economic climate in Texas has moved beyond recovery into an expansion phase in infrastructure, non-residential and residential construction. As such, Texas cement demand currently exceeds available local supply, a trend that\u2019s expected to continue for the near future.","In the third quarter, we shipped 1.525 million tons of cement. Volumes were 16% higher than 2013 when compared with legacy TXI\u2019s publicly disclosed data for the three months ended August 31, 2013 a period higher to our ownership of these assets and reflecting a quarter based on TXI\u2019s fiscal year ended May 31 versus our fiscal year ended December 31.","Cement pricing of $85.95 per ton is $6.52 or 8.2% higher than legacy TXI prices reported for the three months ended August 31, 2013. For the third quarter, the cement business contributed $110 million of net sales and generated nearly $28 million in adjusted gross profit, yielding an adjusted margin of 25%. The adjusted gross profit excludes the non-recurring impact of a required markup of inventory to fair value.","The Texas plants are operating between 75% and 85% utilization and the California plant is operating in the low 70% utilization reflective of a slower recovery in the Southern California construction economy. We anticipate California markets should reach the demand supply equilibrium during 2016.","Our cement group leadership in collaboration with the aggregates and ready-mixed concrete teams developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiency, as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency providing incremental supply for a sold out Texas cement market and a roadmap with significantly improve profitability for 2015 and beyond. Further, on October 1, 2014, we announced the $10 per ton price increase for both the Texas and California market.","Our results for the quarter also underscore the continuing discipline we bring to managing our business. Consolidated SG&A was 5.3% of net sales and 90 basis point reduction compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement reflects transaction synergies, lower pension expense and the absence of information systems upgrade costs incurred in 2013, but does not reflect non-recurring transaction costs. We incurred net acquisition expenses of $26.1 million which includes transaction and integration costs and a gain on the required divestiture of assets.","As detailed on slide 6, our adjusted consolidated earnings from operations, which excludes the cost related to the markup of acquired inventory, as well as net acquisition-related expenses was $153 million. This compares to $109 million in the prior year quarter and represents improvement of more than 40%.","On a year-to-date basis we generated $202 million of operating cash flow compared with $166 million for the prior year period. This increase is primarily due to earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense coupled with cash flow generated from working capital, all in relation to the prior year.","Further, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2014 was 2.91 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant.","As to full year 2014 guidance, we expect continued growth in our markets particularly in areas with strong employment gains and reaffirm our guidance for heritage aggregates product line shipments to increase 6% to 8% and product line pricing to be up 3% to 5%. Heritage aggregates product line direct production cost per ton is expected to remain relatively flat compared with 2013. And lastly we expect the TXI acquisition to essentially breakeven to earnings per diluted share excluding non-recurring cost and corporate overhead allocations.","We have now completed our initial planning for 2015 and are in the process of formulating our definitive guidance which we\u2019ll provide to you in our year-end earnings release. Broadly speaking, we continue to see our end-use markets growing albeit at varying degrees depending on geography.","Importantly, the Eastern United States continues to recover year-over-year. Meanwhile economic expansion in the Western United States will continue to outpace recovery in the east and force the acquire TXI business will contribute significant incremental growth in 2015 driven impart by the realization of a full year of operations coupled with continued synergy realization and operational improvement.","In Martin Marietta geographies, the infrastructure market is expected to increase mid single-digits. Non-residential construction should increase in high single-digits. The residential markets should experience a double-digit increase. And ChemRock and Rail should remain relatively flat.","Our company\u2019s outlook for the cement industry is largely consistent with PCA\u2019s forecast and should increase in the high single-digits.","To conclude, we\u2019re grateful to our shareholders for their support of the TXI acquisition. We are already benefiting from this transformational transaction and the growing demand for building materials. Job growth should continue to serve as a catalyst for construction activity, and provide opportunities for us to increase earnings and create additional shareholder value.","Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta. If the operator will now give the required instructions, we\u2019ll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Arnie Ursaner from CJS Securities. Your question please.","Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities","Good afternoon, Ward and Anne. Could you expand, you gave us some detail about the heritage aggregates business, but could you expand a little bit more about the balance of 2014 and into 2015 by geographies of where you seeing particular strength or weakness and maybe highlight your outlook for the various end markets, because I know you do it bottoms up for various geographies?","Ward Nye","Sure Arnie, thank you for your question. As we look at top side Arnie, the west will continue to outperform, but we\u2019re seeing both in Texas and Colorado is pretty exciting and we see that\u2019s being very strong for the balance of this year, and we see that\u2019s being very strong into next year. I think part of what we discussed in the earnings release and in the telecom is infrastructure work as well as non-res and res in Texas is all very, very attractive right now, same story is true in Colorado.","The fact is all of those are getting better in the Eastern United States, but it\u2019s lumpier and it\u2019s a little bit slower. So for example in the quarter, we saw volumes nicely up in parts of North Carolina. So Charlotte was better quarter-over-quarter, but here is the lumpiness of it, Greensboro and Raleigh were actually modestly down. Now, I do think weather has something to do with that. And I think timing of some infrastructure work has something to do with that. But as you\u2019re aware, when we have that type of group in North Carolina, we discussed for years that we feel that rather disproportionately.","So as we look at the business Arnie, it\u2019s progressing in the recovery phase how I would have thought. Part of what I was pleased with as I looked at quarter is really that the component of the quarter that I think was clearly unplanned is the cost that we incurred relative to rail freight. So, as we pause and step back from that and look at it, rail freight all by itself was somewhere probably $8.5 million to $9 million worth of cost for the quarter. And the reason that I call that out in particular, maintenance repairs is a cost that\u2019s going to ebb and flow depending on what\u2019s happening with volume. But what happened with rail is extraordinary. And for the quarter coming back to your question, if we pull that extraordinary cost out, what I like about the quarter is we were seeing incrementals in our heritage business very much in line with what we\u2019ve been anticipating. So I hope that\u2019s responsive to your question.","Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities","That\u2019s great. And there\u2019s an obvious second question for me if you don\u2019t mind. On the synergies, you mentioned 70 million over three years and in your prepared remarks you said greater and sooner and used a term considerably better. So, I guess it\u2019s fair to ask can you try to quantify what the savings you hope to get are and the timing?","Ward Nye","Let\u2019s think of it then in this term Arnie. So, we talked originally about basically $70 million of operational synergies and let\u2019s call it $34 million of interest rate synergies that gives you $100 million all by itself. Coming back and just speaking to the targeted synergies that we spoke of $70 million that we thought we would have at the end of 2017, based on what I\u2019m seeing right now, I think we\u2019ll likely have $70 million probably by midyear \u201816. So we\u2019re going to capture if at least 18 months in advance. And as I look at what\u2019s going on what I like about that is that\u2019s really going on primarily within what we\u2019re pulling out in the operations. And keep in mind we\u2019ve got quarrying that are littering next door to each other, the fewer operational efficiencies that we\u2019re seeing in the transaction are going nicely ahead of where they thought -- where we thought they would be. And I think what we said is right. Our original estimates for too low and too slow, they\u2019re going to be higher, they\u2019re going to be faster, I think we\u2019ll hit that 70, 18 months of it.","Arnie Ursaner - CJS Securities","Thank you very much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Arnie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your question please?","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. In the 8-K you filed in the quarter was helpful and gave us some sense of the magnitude of contribution of divested asset related to the TXI transaction. For the quarter end what was the revenue and gross profit contribution impact of those divested assets and also tagging that you a little bit earlier with the freight impact in quarter, have you taken a stab at what contribution margins would have been with the clean year-over-year cost taking to account those divested asset? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Let me look at this right, Kathryn. If we look at the divested assets, if I look at the tonnage that came out for the quarter, it\u2019s probably around 570 some thousand tons for the quarter. So that\u2019s probably a good way for you to go back and really sort out what that means. I think the second part of your question I think it really goes back to what we were talking about before, if we\u2019re simply looking at the change in cost quarter-over-quarter, the rail freight and the adjustment there is the primary driver on where we\u2019re seeing the difference. And again, if that\u2019s $9 million, if you take that $9 million bring it back into the adjusted gross margin of 162 and then go back and at least work with call it 575,000 tons that work historically coming out of North Troy. I think that gives you your bridge.","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","Okay, great. Thank you. Looking at some of the certain regions in the Southeast, particularly more call it a passionate certain markets, Alabama which received feedback not only from our base and material contracts, but also our building product distributor. So, completely different construction end market. What has been the feedback or the driver of just tapping at the pedal and then in certain markets. In other words is it a more end market focus, weather driven or is there something else we should take in consideration. And what do you see on [Touchstone]?","Ward Nye","As far as what you\u2019re seeing in Alabama and the entities in South, is that your question, Kathryn?","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","Yes, it is.","Ward Nye","Okay. I think the primary issue that we are seeing there and principally more in part of a quarter, remember we are not all things to all people in Florida. We\u2019re really infrastructure play in Florida and our positions in Alabama are really more headed toward Birmingham and heading South as well. I think what we\u2019re seeing particularly in Florida is we have a timing issue and the timing issue is relative to larger projects.","So, we know for example the I-4 Ultimate work is going to began in 2015. That\u2019s going to be significant work for multi-years inside of a record Florida DOT program. So, we\u2019re looking at that portion of the Southeast. We think it\u2019s more of a timing issue. Part of what I was particularly hard to see though is we do continue to see a nice recovery in North Georgia.","And as you recall, we\u2019ve changed our footprint in that Atlanta market pretty considerably over the last five or six years and have a very attractive number two position in Atlanta today, which is very different from number four and number five position we would have there 6 or 7 years ago. So, what I would say direct response is we think Florida is a timing issue for us on infrastructure and we think North Georgia continues to recover.","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","Great. You described that a little bit in your prepared comments, but have you seen any change in pace of orders or change in conversations and energy beverage regions and response to the decline in lower pricing?","Ward Nye","We have not. And the simple fact is if we go and take a look at what\u2019s going on in shale with our business, I can say our shale-related tonnage. And again this is in frac material, this is what\u2019s going to road it\u2019s going to [pads] et cetera was up 424,000 tons for third quarter last year to third quarter last year.","My guess is at the end of this year, we\u2019re going to see tonnage going to those different shale plays of an access of $7 million tons. Now but I would remind you, obviously I think most people last year thought it probably peaked up and if we\u2019re right this year is going to be higher than last year was. Here is what we\u2019re seeing and the different place Niobrara is better, Marcellus is better, Eagle Ford is better, Haynesville is better and Barnett is off. Now that\u2019s really the way that stacks up right now, Kathryn.","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","Okay. thank you. Then my final question today, just to clarify what you had certain specific comments regarding interest expense. Is interest expense reported in Q3 a good run rate going forward or there will be additional decline on quarterly run rate going forward?","Anne Lloyd","Kathryn I think the interest rate in the third quarter is a pretty solid run rate.","Kathryn Thompson - Thompson Research Group","Great. Thank you so much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Kasprzak from BB&T. Your question please.","Jack Kasprzak - BB&T","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","Ward Nye","Hey Jack.","Jack Kasprzak - BB&T","With regard to the rail congestion and the increased cost there, isn\u2019t it likely to persist at least for a little while longer?","Ward Nye","I think it is and I said it much in our prepared remarks. I think several things are affecting Class 1 railroads. I think a lot of them came out of a very difficult winter behind April. I think they have had a lot of traffic this year in March driven by what\u2019s going on their rails. I think some of their infrastructure needs some work right now. I mean we\u2019re certainly seeing evidence of that. So I do think that continues to go on. I think part of the evidence of it is, Class 1 railroads this year by my data will use about 20% less ballast in 2014 than they did in 2013 and our ballast shipments are down a little bit less than that year-over-year. It\u2019s not the lack of need that they are taking that ballast. They\u2019ve got that much activity on the ballast. Now, here is the quick response to it as well, Jack. And I think the way that we\u2019ll likely respond to that is twofold. One we have the ability to run distributed power and bring more cars into our yards and make up for inefficiency by share volume coming through. And candidly the other component of it is transportation is going to be tight for everyone by both rail and by truck and that\u2019s likely to end up being a price point. And I think if we continue to see that type of headwind, I think we\u2019re going to come back and we\u2019re going to adjust prices accordingly.","Jack Kasprzak - BB&T","Got you. Thanks for the color. Let me ask about corporate overhead in the quarter which I think you are even take out the acquisition cost that you reported is up substantially in the high 50 million versus a little less than 6 million in the same period last year. Obviously you have TXI later in there and you told us not to compare legacy TXI numbers but to my point of reference, we have and it seems like an outsized increase even after adjusting for the acquisition cost taking them out, is there something else in there or how should we think about the corporate line going forward?","Anne Lloyd","We look at corporate overhead and Jack, I want to make sure I am following you where you are. I mean we look at total SG&A cost to $48 million versus $37 million last year. The corporate pieces principally have all the acquisition related cost in them. And then if you look at TXI as a whole, so if you look at the acquired operations, we picked up about, rounding about $16 million of SG&A from the acquired businesses. Included in that $16 million is about $4.5 million of basically overhead we allocated here from the corporate office, there was some unallocated overhead that remained that we allocated to that business, there is about $6 million of what I\u2019ll call duplicative overhead and that is the remaining SG&A really left as we continue to integrate the ready mixed concrete and the cement businesses which is most commonly indicated, we are expecting to be done by June of next year, so that cost to begin to work its way out of the system.","So as we look at the pure SG&A that we picked up from TXI, I think we picked up around $5 million of SG&A on a go forward basis against their corporate run rate in the third quarter or quarter ended August 31st of about $18.5 million. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re looking at. If you\u2019ve got some other specific questions, maybe we can uncap that offline.","Jack Kasprzak - BB&T","That\u2019s helpful to go directionally, thank you. And the diesel fuel, can you tell us the price change in the maybe for the heritage operations if you have that versus last year?","Ward Nye","I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve got 309 in Q3 versus 322 last year in the same quarter. So, we\u2019re seeing a nice decline. And obviously what we\u2019ve got is about two weeks worth of storage at facilities. So, if that helps, I\u2019m going to stay a little bit for Q3; if it continues like that, it really is going to be much more of a player in Q4 than it was in three.","Jack Kasprzak - BB&T","Yes, very good. Okay. Thank you.","Ward Nye","All right. Thank you Jack.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your question please?","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","So, a follow-up question to the last one with respect to diesel costs and your expectation that it should offset the higher anticipated rail congestion expenses. Just wondering if you could maybe provide some clarification. Are you expecting that the lower diesel is going to fully offset or just be a partial offset moving forward?","Ward Nye","Hi Garik. I think it will be a partial offset; I don\u2019t -- I think the word I used was mitigate, not offset. So, I think it will make it easier going forward, but I don\u2019t think it makes up a whole.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay. And with respect to cement price increases that you have mentioned for October in both of your states, can you provide maybe a little bit more color on how those are sticking at this point?","Ward Nye","Yes, I can Garik. I mean we don\u2019t see any retraction on those at all. I mean we went into both Texas and California resolute that we needed to have those, I don\u2019t think we like we particularly needed to have that in California. Our intention is to make that plant profitable and that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do and the other thing that we intend to do is come back with a very similar looking increase in 2015 as well.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks. And then just a question for Anne. Just under tax guidance of 39% for the full year, quite a big step-up obviously in the fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about the tax rate looking forward?","Anne Lloyd","The tax rate is paid down and track down all of the really TXI-related costs that were non-deductible including the goodwill that we wrote-off for the divested assets sort of the change in control costs that were not allowed tax deductibility and some of the transaction costs that were tax deductible. If you strip all of that out, the ongoing tax rate for the core business including TXI is 29%, which is really where our guidance thought it would be. If you recall back in the second quarter, we indicated we probably have a 29% tax rate excluding this figure there. All of these TXI issues are what drove the tax rate to that from the 29% to 39%. So, I expect it to continue to be 39% for the fourth quarter because it\u2019s just (inaudible) the run rate is 29%.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay. That makes sense. And I guess just my last question on the TXI accretion guidance for this year is expected to be flat. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, it\u2019s not previously when you had announced the deal you had anticipated accretion to earnings for this year and for year one closing somewhere along lies in mid-to-high-teens accretion. Just wondering, if you could speak to the change, is it just a timing issue around the closing and if you are still contemplating the year one accretion levels that you previously outlined?","Ward Nye","Thanks for the question. I think we\u2019re sticking with what we thought full year one would look like. I\u2019m going to quote one of my colleagues who looked at this and said, this is all subject to the tyranny of purchase price accounting. And candidly, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re dealing with. When you look at the inventories and the other odd things that go through purchase price accounting, they are in [advisory] delta. I think we could end this year with this deal being accretive. I think it depends on what fourth quarter looks like. And I\u2019m hopeful that that\u2019s where it will be. But if we come back and really look at what the delta is, I would point you to purchase price accounting and what\u2019s tied up in that.","Garik Shmois - Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks so much. Best of luck.","Ward Nye","Okay. Thank you, Garik.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Matt Ryback - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. It\u2019s Matt Ryback on behalf of Jerry. It sounds like you had some pockets of soft demand overall. Just wondering if you could talk about whether volumes improved in October and maybe say more about your confidence in the mid single-digit infrastructure growth next year?","Ward Nye","","I guess a couple of things on that. We\u2019ll tell you more about Q4 when we\u2019re together in February, but here is what I\u2019ve always said about October. It should be the busiest month that the aggregates industry in this country sees. And if you\u2019ve got good weather, you would have to work reasonably well. And what I\u2019ll tell you is I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s doing for you, but it\u2019s sunny and clear in Raleigh today. So, but I\u2019ll talk more about October when we get together in February.","As we come back and address your question relative to infrastructure next year, here is what I would say on that as well. We\u2019re showing infrastructure up, it\u2019s all about where you are. And here is why we see infrastructure up. It\u2019s going to be another good year in Colorado. It\u2019s going to be another steady year in [Iowa]. It\u2019s going to be another great year in Texas. I think we\u2019ve got probably four years of great infrastructure work ahead of us in Texas. We\u2019ve got Florida clearly getting better year-over-year with a record DOT program. And we\u2019re seeing a good steady program right now in North Carolina. The Governor has come back, he\u2019s laid out his 20 plus year vision of transportation here. It\u2019s more urban focused than it\u2019s been historically, but he is also looking at a considerable bonding program that could come back and have more rural initiatives as well.","So when we come back and say Colorado feels better, Iowa feels fine, Texas feels better, Florida feels better and North Carolina feels steady, that gives us a good start. I think if we again more a Northeast or more Great Lakes focused I would probably have more concern, but if I look at where we are I feel good about infrastructure next year.","Matt Ryback - Goldman Sachs","Great. And then just to follow-up on pricing, pricing has been well ahead of your guidance. Can you talk about what surprise to the upside and maybe why you\u2019re not changing the pricing guidance range for the full year?","Ward Nye","Well, keep in mind, we had a lot of mixed issues and timing at the beginning of the year, so we thought we would see a make-up as we came through the year. I think part of what\u2019s giving us some tailwind on that right now is we did see more midyear price increases this year than we\u2019ve seen last year. As a remainder, we actually saw midyear price increase in Dallas Fort Worth market this year and that\u2019s been a market for years that we did not see a midyear price increase. So again, I think the pricing is doing exactly what we thought the price would do and the volume recovery we always said there was going to be a lag there, but I feel good about it, feel good about as we look into \u201815.","Anne Lloyd","And also Matt, I would say that the fourth quarter pricing is very much affected by mix of agricultural line shipment and that will obviously be dependent on -- it\u2019s very weather dependent as to whether that ag line goes down.","Matt Ryback - Goldman Sachs","Perfect. Thank you very much Anne.","Ward Nye","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your question please?","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Hi thanks. Good afternoon.","Ward Nye","Good morning Trey.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Kind of back to the cost in the quarter, you pointed to the rail but also I think you said $8 million to $9 million in the quarter from congestion there, but you expect diesel should mitigate this. So just for clarity, so the impact in 4Q from this kind of net of diesel should be less than the $8 million to $9 million that you realized in 3Q, we think about that right?","Ward Nye","I think you\u2019re thinking that right Trey. I mean I think directionally you are in the right place on that. I think the maintenance and repair spike that we\u2019re seeing is not a surprise. We talked about last quarter, it\u2019s not going to be something that goes in a quarter or two. But I think you will see that come back into a more normal place. But I do think if we have diesel down and we have a normal Q4, it will certainly start to mitigate some of the congestion and related issues that we\u2019re seeing in rail.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Okay. I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but the higher repaired supply cost, what was that in the quarter?","Ward Nye","It\u2019s about $4 million.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Okay. And then looking at your initial guidance range for \u201815 volume, I guess kind of the directional range for \u201815 volume. I appreciate you\u2019ve given us kind of an insight into that a little early and you have made a few comments, but didn\u2019t really get into a whole lot of detail about pricing. But just given the backdrop of volume, could you give us any directional sense or any color on how you think about pricing in that kind of demand environment?","Ward Nye","As you heard us say before Trey, I think pricing tends to follow volume up with the lag. And I think we clearly feel the benefit of increased midyear pricing this year, more next year. I think if we come back and take a look at where we particularly see strong economies and we have leadership positions in Texas and what we could do in Colorado. Keep in mind, even as we look at the quarter, we\u2019re looking at price increases on a percentage basis in the west that are going up higher than they are in the east. So there is your volume and your price link. So, I think we\u2019ll continue to see that. And obviously, we\u2019ll give more definitive guidance on pricing when we come out in February with our full year results. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk about that at the Investor Day that we\u2019re playing in February as well. But I think the pricing story continues to be a very different and very appropriate in this industry given the reserves that are incredibly valuable and hard to permit.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Okay. Thanks for that Ward. And then you mentioned in October $10 price increase in cement. It sounds like that\u2019s come along pretty well. But there is some announcement from some of your competition in those markets, California and Texas for price increases, substantial price increases as we look into 2015. What are your thoughts as we kind of look into those announcements? Have you guys put anything out in those markets for that timeframe or just general thoughts on increases on cement as we look into next year especially in the Texas and California market?","Ward Nye","I guess, this is when I would say Texas is sold out, I mean Texas is sold out. And I think when you\u2019re operating in a sold out market, obviously you\u2019re going to see pricing do what pricing will do in a sold out market. I think the other thing that\u2019s perfectly inherent is California is working its way back to equilibrium. I think one of the things that we\u2019re most excited about is coming back and increasing the efficiencies in all of our plants Trey, within the permit limits to make sure that we can really meet this rising demand need also in a situation in Texas where do see pricing going up very nicely.","So I guess my point would be this, in a sold out market, you\u2019d expect pricing to go up. In a market in which frankly we need to make that plant profitable, you\u2019re going to see as push price, we\u2019re deciding our brand, because we need to do that. But what I think as well is we can come back and add as much as 250,000 additional tons of cement to our business next year just through efficiencies. And I spoke in my prepared remarks of what our teams were doing to ramp those up and simply getting a place like Hunter and Hunter [One] that\u2019s operating in the high 70s up to something closer to deals like 85% working its way toward 90% which is the type of the theoretical world class capacity that we\u2019re looking to. Giving us that type of volume in that type of pricing environment is where we think we need to be.","Trey Grooms - Stephens","Great. Thanks for the response, Ward. And good luck.","Ward Nye","","Thank you very much, Trey.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good afternoon, Ward and Anne.","Ward Nye","Timna welcome back.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I just want to take a step back and ask a little bit since this acquisition didn\u2019t burden you too much on the balance sheet, I wanted to hear a little bit more about your thoughts of uses of cash down the road as we look into 2015. So you touched on some optionality perhaps of expanding at Midlothian, you have clearly the acquisition environment seems to be hued a little bit for aggregates. So just wanted to get your panorama of opportunities and how you\u2019re thinking about it?","Ward Nye","That\u2019s a fair question, Timna because I think we\u2019re going to have a nice [sprouting] going forward because I think we\u2019ve got what is going to be a remarkably cash generative business. I think the opportunities to continue to grow our business responsibly is one that we\u2019re excited about. So number one, we\u2019ll look at it from that lens. And number two, we are going to come back and look very carefully the way that we put capital into the business as well because part of what we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters and we\u2019ve talked about it as volume ramps up, rolling stock needs some help. And we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re putting appropriate and sensible capital in rolling stock.","The other thing that we\u2019re always going to be sensitive to and always look at is coming back and looking at share repurchase and where we are. We\u2019ve got an authorization from our Board right now that we\u2019re mindful of, but we\u2019ve -- look we like acquisitions we like Martin Marietta too and we\u2019re going to be looking at that going forward.","Part of what I\u2019m grateful for is, shareholders, as you said, we didn\u2019t put our balance sheet in any form of -- in fact our balance sheet is in a very good place. At the same time, shareholders would like to see some of the natural dilution that occurred from that go way and we\u2019re sensitive to that. So, we\u2019re going to be looking basically at what we\u2019re going to do with acquisitions, we\u2019re going to be looking at what we\u2019re doing with capital and we\u2019re going to be looking at really what we can do with extra cash. The thing that I would remind we\u2019re 120 days end. So, it all sounds exciting and it is exciting. And we think it\u2019s a great story, but I\u2019ll say we\u2019re 120 days there.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That make sense. Just to be able to more granular real quick and I know there has been a lot of discussion about this, but on the rail side our folks are expecting that this isn\u2019t a temporary situation this could last into next year and even two years. And I just want to understand how the mechanism would be if you were pass along price hike. Would that be lag effect, could you do it on a case-by-case basis or how might that look?","Ward Nye","I think it\u2019d be several form. I think you can look at just a pure price increase. I think you can look at surcharges, although that\u2019s never been a mechanism that we prefer. And again, I think part of what we can do to mitigate that because of the way that we build our rail yards, if the traffic is going down we can put in longer train. If we\u2019re going with distributed power and by that meaning really two locomotives one at the front one in the middle, we can go in and we consider being more than 100 cars and that\u2019s the dialogue we\u2019ve been having with all the Class 1 railroads.","Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Sounds like you\u2019re on it. Thank you for your help.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Timna.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your question please.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Hey guys, how are you doing?","Ward Nye","Hi Ted.","Anne Lloyd","Hi Ted.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Anne, I was wondering if you could go through the EBITDA bridge that we\u2019ve historically done on the legacy side of it. I know you have made comments, I think you have outlined $8 million or $9 million of headwinds on rail and maybe four R&M on legacy side. But could we just go through that? And I know on slide six you had kind of a $49 million bucket, but could we maybe just aggregate what that is?","Anne Lloyd","Okay. So the $49 million bucket, can we have a detail of that in the back, excuse me Ted. That\u2019s going to include -- has it been adjusted? There has been no detail provided on that one, excuse me. But those cost increases are going to include for the aggregate product line the $9 million on rail that we\u2019ve been talking about; the $4 million on maintenance and supply; and then the normal cost increase that come along with the volume on the business.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","And so when you go into the cost, could you just help us understand, I mean last quarter you guys were very helpful in kind of explaining inventory dynamics. Was there a repeat of that at all in the legacy business this quarter?","Anne Lloyd","Not at all. As we indicated in the last quarter, it was -- we didn\u2019t it was, but no there was not. We made the conscious decision and to reduce inventories for the second quarter. And now the inventories we think are in good balance. ","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Okay. So, those are kind of the key factors that you would bridge on the legacy aggregates business?","Anne Lloyd","Yes.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Okay. And then on the specialty products, I guess we\u2019ve come to expect incremental kind of a net 30% range, it was a little low this quarter. Were there any kind of discrete cost items that would have weighed on incrementals that will be helpful to be aware of?","Ward Nye","Really you\u2019ve got two things there Ted, I mean you\u2019ve got natural gas pricing year-over-year up but 2Q to Q3 down that\u2019s the quick way to think about that. The other issue that we\u2019re faced within that is we did have a kiln shutdown that affected that business to the tune comparatively about $1.2 million. So if you look at the net gas and the kiln down for a period of time, which happens, I mean that\u2019s just a way that this (inaudible) outage. That\u2019s entirely the difference.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","Okay. And then the last thing I was hoping to ask before I jump back. When you talk about infrastructure being up potentially mid double-digits -- I\u2019m sorry, mid single-digits next year, could you walk through how much of that is public versus private and how you\u2019re thinking about the public piece of infrastructure?","Ward Nye","That\u2019s all public in our domain. Although, there may be pieces of it that have a P3 component to it, because as you know on all major infrastructure projects now in the United States under map 21, they have to go and look if whether a P3 element would makes sense to go with it. But as we\u2019re looking at that just to be clear, it\u2019s all public infrastructure.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","And then so, are you making any assumptions on the federal highway bill, the highway bill or is that all kind of driven by other programs mostly state and local?","Ward Nye","I guess the primary -- it\u2019s primarily driven on the upside about what\u2019s going on in the state right. Because they\u2019re clearly taking more and more charge of what they\u2019re doing. On the federal side Ted, the primary thing we\u2019re assuming is just going to keep on, keeping on, it\u2019s relatively flat in our view and that\u2019s the assumption that we\u2019re making.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","So that was the last thing I wanted to ask, because just kind of what\u2019s the latest you\u2019re hearing on the highway bill, optimism you have or like thereof and then I\u2019ll get back in queue?","Ward Nye","Sure. I guess here is to take I\u2019ve got Ted and nobody\u2019s that\u2019s been right on it. So you can probably add me to that queue as well. I think legislative fatigue is going to take this over. If we look back to the last of $11 billion that when it showed up, every time they go to the well looking for whatever the next $11 billion is, it gets harder to get. And I think one of the things that I was most moved by as I was reading this week is this notion that if the Republicans for example took the House from Senate, one of the issues they\u2019re concerned about is that they don\u2019t demonstrate an ability to govern. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019ll get a shot at a White House in 2016. And as we\u2019re looking at things that are simply fundamental to job creation and economic growth, the transportation bill is one of them. And part of what we\u2019ve seen there\u2019s been recent study that actually did put out early in the month or last month things that are sustainable feel like this would add 2 million jobs of construction jobs in the United States. So, I think as we sit here and consider the fact that they\u2019ve kicked the can down the road but there is just not a lot of road left to kick the can down. I think our sense is we do end up getting a fixed; they do have to deal with the rough side of it. Nobody necessarily needs to do that but simply gasoline going down as much as it has over the last several weeks and months and the fact that it\u2019s likely to continue going down may give people opportunities to do that. That\u2019s probably a long answer Ted. I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s precise but it\u2019s probably as good as anybody can offer right now.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna","That\u2019s very helpful guys. Best of luck this quarter.","Ward Nye","Thanks Ted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Hughes from SunTrust. Your question please?","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Yes, a couple of questions. First on the NOLs, you raised your estimate to 500 million. Can you just kind of update on timing of how the shape or form you\u2019ll be realizing those?","Anne Lloyd","Yes, we actually think over the next several years and if you look in the press release, this year we indicated that in 2014 we\u2019ll actually be able to use 84 million of those NOLs.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","","Do you have a \u201815 estimate at this point?","Anne Lloyd","We don\u2019t have -- well, I do, but we haven\u2019t talked about it. We\u2019ll talk about that when we release guidance for the balance the year.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Are these NOLs in the next let\u2019s call it 18 months or so, are they on foregoing capital gains taxes or are they on operating income?","Anne Lloyd","It\u2019s operating income.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","And I think you said 39% tax rate in the fourth quarter so that seems a little high considering you\u2019re getting an NOL. How does that all work out?","Anne Lloyd","Well, as I indicated early, this is the effective tax rate, the NOL only deals with your cash taxes.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Okay, I got that. Thanks.","Anne Lloyd","And we\u2019ve also indicated we estimate cash taxes for the full year is expected to be about $13 million.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Switching back to the previous question on assumption for infrastructure spending in \u201815, you\u2019re assuming flat federal dollars that would mean at same stage what have to be double-digits less or some kind of [trickier] offsetting there, can you reconcile that for me, Ward?","Ward Nye","I think we don\u2019t see it could be offsetting there because if we\u2019re looking at 77 hot lanes in Charlotte at high four, and Charlotte -- I mean in Florida right now if we\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going Interstate 35E and Dallas and we\u2019re looking at more underground Park Lane in Houston. Those are just some of the headline projects. We also think that we\u2019ll see more of those come through as we enter into \u201815.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Okay. And then final question, I know you don\u2019t typically breakout revenues by state or geographies, but Texas becomes so important to you here and so many good things going on. Can you just give us a feel of how much of the my revenues are intensive?","Ward Nye","We\u2019ll give you some more of that at the end of the year. Here is a good way to think about it, look at what\u2019s going on in non-resi in United States because that\u2019s an area that\u2019s we\u2019re getting considerably better year-over-year, it\u2019s fasting. Look we\u2019ve seen an additional $30 billion of non-resi activity in the United States this year. What that means effectively is that $45 billion of areas that are up about $15 billion that are down, but next year to the 30. Here is the takeaway, $15 billion of it is in Houston all by itself. So that gives you a sense of to your point how important and how dynamic Texas is but at year-end we\u2019ll come back to give you the snapshot.","Anne Lloyd","And Keith just a reminder, we obviously will have to likely be what we\u2019ll give you is what we think 2015 looks like because obviously 2014 will only have half the year of TXI\u2019s operations in it.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Yes, I was looking for pro forma combined.","Anne Lloyd","Yes. So, we\u2019ll give that to you as we come out with the annual guidance.","Keith Hughes - SunTrust","Okay. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Thanks Keith.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Betts from Jefferies. Your question please.","Mike Betts - Jefferies","Yes. Thank you very much. I just got two questions left, if I could. Firstly on SG&A and I heard your comment on the check side that was fill-up by another $10 million to go out which we at least give about $5 million in that, that seems extremely low on almost a billion of sales. Maybe I\u2019m missing something and I guess the real fundamental question Ward is with the new IT system and with cement potentially requiring less SG&A. Now we move to structurally lower level of SG&A as a percentage of sales within the business?","And then my second question just on the TXI heritage aggregates price, the $11.83. You gave an explanation, Ward and thank you for why it was higher. My question is though do you report the aggregates pricing any different from the way TXI reported that number. I mean is there a some kind of accounting difference or actually is that all mix I mean with that number similar to what they would have looked like and you are attempting? Thank you.","Ward Nye","I\u2019d say, let\u2019s do this way, let\u2019s bifurcate that. I\u2019m going to talk about pricing and aggregates and Anne is going to talk a little bit about SG&A. I think this is what\u2019s going on. I do think you are seeing sand short in much of Texas to give you a sense of it. The sand and gravel numbers that we\u2019re seeing in much of Texas right now is actually ahead of our corporate average. So it\u2019s somewhere between $11 and $12 a ton.","We\u2019re also -- keep in mind and this is different. We gave up those two yards at Frisco and Dallas. We picked up 8, so that\u2019s 8 yards, so we picked up in Texas. The average selling price of those yards is in excess of $60 a ton. Now Mike to answer your question directly when we come back and look at what\u2019s going on at the stone facility that we picked up in North Texas, they do tend to be considerably lower than our corporate average that\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on right now and that help TXI would have rolled all of that out. And you do have some dynamism in the market right now, particularly relative to what\u2019s going on in sand and gravel that has used that. I hope that\u2019s responsive to your question. I\u2019ll let Anne to talk about SG&A.","Mike Betts - Jefferies","Thank you.","Anne Lloyd","Change in SG&A, I do believe that we\u2019re entering an area and arena at time we will have some structural change. As I think about 2015 and beyond, I don\u2019t believe a 5.3% SG&A level on this side is sustainable, but neither do I think it\u2019s going to be 7.5%. I think if I was modeling, I\u2019d probably put in 6% to 6.5% of total sales as a pretty decent run rate on a business at this revenue base. But obviously we like to always outperform against our target. So we\u2019ll always work to keep that going down.","Mike Betts - Jefferies","That\u2019s great. Thanks both of you.","Ward Nye","Thanks Mike.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your question please?","Stanley Elliott - Stifel","Hey, thank you for taking my question, most of have been answered. Real quick on the specialty products. You mentioned the kiln shutdown. What happens in Q4 to kind of get to the gross profits ramp like it\u2019s schedule to do according to guidance?","Ward Nye","Look, I think we just -- the pricing is working we\u2019re seeing a lot of demand for clays, we\u2019re seeing a lot of demand for chemical products as we come back and look at the types of margins that we\u2019re getting on that business on a record quarter. I don\u2019t see anything disrupting that. And we won\u2019t have to count them. I think those are your differences, Stanley.","Anne Lloyd","I\u2019ve got to say we\u2019ve got a 34% margin on that business for the quarter. It\u2019s a darn good business.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel","No look, I think it\u2019s 32 but when you look at it, the sequential ramp relative to how it\u2019s been historically, I was just curious, plus I got out of questions.","Anne Lloyd","We\u2019ll give you that.","Stanley Elliott - Stifel","","Thank you.","","Ward Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Amanda, and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.","Suzanne Osberg - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available, during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q3 2018 supplemental information that summarizes our quarterly results and trends.","As detailed on slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise.","We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our third quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC website. Please note that all financial and operating results discussed today are for third quarter 2018. Any comparisons are versus the prior year quarter unless otherwise noted and all margin references are based on revenue.","Adjusted results exclude acquisition-related net expenses, the impact of selling acquired inventory after its markup to fair value in accordance with acquisition accounting, and restructuring charge. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q3 2018 supplemental information and SEC filing.","We will begin today's earnings call with Ward Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance as well market trends heading into 2019. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow.","I will now turn the call over to Ward.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta continues to benefit from an improving construction cycle and the strength of our operational performance. We achieved record third quarter revenues, gross profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA and diluted earnings per share. And we delivered these impressive results while successfully managing near-term challenges from historically high levels of precipitation.","We estimate weather negatively impacted third quarter profitability by $40 million to $45 million. Importantly, as noted in today's earnings release, we remain on course to once again deliver record revenues and EBITDA for the full year and are well-positioned for continued growth in 2019.","We're confident that the construction cycle is not nearing its peak in Martin Marietta served markets and a wide range of factors support steady and sustainable construction growth and favorable pricing in the near-to-medium term.","Specifically, for the third quarter, in July and August, we experienced more manageable weather patterns. Consistent with our internal expectations, aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete shipments meaningfully accelerated and pricing also improved. These trends highlight the attractive demand environment across our geographic footprint, particularly in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa and are wholly consistent with our broader expectations.","In September, we experienced extraordinary weather, including Hurricane Florence and record Texas rainfall pausing the third quarter's earlier momentum which is typically our industry's busiest and most profitable period. These notable disruptions impacted more than half of our Building Materials business as measured by revenues. Regardless of underlying market strength, Mother Nature can temporarily interrupt construction activity.","Hurricane Florence made landfall in Eastern North Carolina not far from the South Carolina border. This event affected at least 15 of September's 19 selling days as the region was either preparing for, enduring and\/or cleaning up from the storm. Indeed this unusually slow-moving storm produced torrential rainfall and widespread inland flooding throughout the Carolinas, leaving an estimated $17 billion of damage and over 18 trillion gallons of water in its wake. That's enough water to fill the Chesapeake Bay. And 10 billion gallons of it filled our Castle Hayne and Belgrade quarries in Eastern North Carolina.","While Texas was not affected by Hurricane Florence, the state experienced its wettest September in the last 124 years. Dallas\/Fort Worth had nearly 13 inches of rain during the month, while San Antonio received nearly 17 inches of rain, almost 14 inches above normal. Texas is our largest state by revenues. With aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete operations throughout the Texas Triangle, the negative financial impact of September's record rain fall was considerably more significant than both Hurricane Florence and last year's Hurricane Harvey combined.","Most importantly, we're grateful that our employees and their families are safe in the aftermath of September's severe weather. Our thoughts, prayers and relief efforts are geared toward those affected as they rebuild their lives and communities.","As a company, we manage what we can control. We've initiated pumping activities at flooded North Carolina quarries and systematically resumed sales at the vast majority of our affected locations. Since North Carolina is our third largest state by revenues and our leading state by unit profitability, Mid-America Group shipments, pricing, production and margins have been disproportionately negatively affected in the near-term. However, we view this situation for precisely what it is, temporary. As we've seen historically, emergency repairs to houses, businesses and transportation networks are critical in the early days and weeks following natural disasters. Reconstruction efforts typically require years of steady building activity with increased demand in heavy side building materials.","Importantly, we remain appropriately focused on our tactical day-to-day decisions and mindful of the long-term aspects of our business. We know the dynamics of our industry, the varied needs and abilities of our communities, customers and suppliers, and how these forces coalesce. That's why Martin Marietta's course has been fashioned around macroeconomics reflecting the powerful demographic and related trends that we see as so critical to overall success in our space.","Accordingly, our leading market positions, disciplined pricing strategy and execution of our strategic plan position Martin Marietta for further growth and shareholder value creation as the ongoing construction cycle continues for the foreseeable future.","To be clear, in our view, the construction cycle is not nearing its peak in Martin Marietta served markets. In fact, many of our most attractive areas, while growing, are still well below mid-cycle shipment levels. Further, it remains difficult to see an end to this recovery when the long-awaited arrival of increased infrastructure activity has only recently begun in earnest.","Throughout our geographic footprint, we see no signs of either a slowdown or markets that are overbuilt. To the contrary, employment and population trends, together with the solid fiscal health of our key states, support steady and sustainable construction growth in the near-to-medium term. Our optimism is further bolstered by favorable pricing trends, typically an indicator of underlying market strength.","Now, let's review the third quarter operating results in more detail. Heritage aggregate shipments adjusted for third quarter 2017 volumes from the Forsyth County, Georgia quarry we divested in April 2018 grew 4%. We estimate heritage volume growth would have been closer to 12% absent the noted weather headwinds.","Public construction activity is typically the most weather-sensitive sector due to strict Department of Transportation specifications and performance standards. Accordingly, heritage aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market were flat as large public projects underway in North Carolina and Texas were delayed.","Importantly, we're encouraged by the recent acceleration in public lettings and contract awards, most notably in Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and by improving rail service. The percentage of our heritage aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market remains below the company's most recent five-year average of 43%. As state DOTs and contractors continue to address labor constraints and the broader industry benefits from further regulatory reform, infrastructure construction activity should continue to be bolstered from the funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act.","Additionally, state and local initiatives such as the infrastructure funding proposals included on Colorado's ballot today show a growing grassroots effort to relieve traffic congestion and improve commute times. State and local initiatives have historically garnered strong voter approval and we believe they will play an expanded role in public sector activity.","Heritage aggregate shipments to the non-residential market increased 5% in the third quarter driven primarily by data and distribution centers as well as wind farms. Consistent with third-party forecasts, non-residential construction activity should continue to increase in both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years in key Martin Marietta markets.","Additional federal regulatory approvals supported by higher oil prices should notably contribute to increased aggregates consumption from the next wave of energy sector projects, particularly along the Gulf Coast. Construction activity for these projects is expected to begin in earnest in 2019 and beyond. The nonresidential market represented 33% of third quarter heritage aggregate shipments.","Heritage aggregate shipments to the residential market increased 7%. Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Georgia and South Carolina consistently rank in the top 10 states nationally for growth in single-family housing unit starts. Inclusive of Iowa, Maryland, and Indiana, growth in single-family housing unit permits for our top nine states is outpacing the national average.","Looking ahead, regional residential construction growth should continue as supported by employment and population gains in our key markets. And while mortgage rate increases may temporarily dampen the growth of housing starts, once stabilized, the residential market will adapt and continue to strengthen.","Our view in this respect is not based upon blind optimism and hope, it's fact based. Specifically, housing starts have yet to return to historical levels despite notable population gains. We see the homebuilding industry is just beginning to address the shortage of single-family housing units that exists, particularly for entry level homes.","Our leading positions in southeastern and southwestern states offer superior opportunities to benefit from this expected growth. Furthermore, continued strength in residential construction supports future infrastructure and nonresidential activity. The residential market accounted for 20% of third quarter aggregate shipments.","To conclude our discussion on end uses, heritage aggregate shipments to the ChemRock\/Rail market accounted for the remaining third quarter shipments and increased 6%, reflecting improved balance shipments for Midwest and Rocky Mountain Divisions.","Heritage aggregates pricing improved 3%. The combination of product and geographic mix lowered the company's average selling price by $0.13 per ton or 1%. The Mid-America Group, which includes the Carolinas, posted heritage pricing growth of nearly 3%, reflecting the impact of weather and a higher percentage of lower-priced ballast shipments.","Product mix muted heritage pricing growth for the Southeast Group to 2% as our offshore operations opportunistically shipped more lower-priced sand material. Double-digit pricing growth in Colorado was partially offset by product mix and reduced long-haul shipments in Texas, resulting in a 3% increase in West Group pricing.","Factoring in expected full year product and geographic mix, heritage aggregates pricing is expected to increase 3% to 4% for 2018. The recently acquired Bluegrass Materials operations remain on track in 2018 despite Maryland's second wettest year on record. As a reminder, selling prices for these operations are 10% to 15% below our corporate average. Synergy realization is progressing ahead of plan.","Cement shipments and pricing increased 8% and 3% respectively, reflecting positive demand in the vibrant Texas economy. Importantly, both our Midlothian and Hunter operations reported double digit volume growth prior to September's record rainfall, highlighting the underlying demand in our Texas markets. Our cement business has recently announced an $8 per ton price increase effective April 2019.","Turning to our downstream businesses, ready mixed concrete shipments increased 3% with solid gains throughout the Rocky Mountain and Southwest Divisions despite September's record rainfall in Texas. Overall third quarter ready mixed concrete prices increased 3%, with solid improvements in most markets.","In Colorado, project delays and permitting issues led to the 9% decrease in hot mixed asphalt shipments. Pricing was relatively flat as more contractors bid on both a reduced number of as well as more geographically concentrated Colorado DOT projects. This transitory situation should improve in 2019 with greater Colorado DOT funding and more dispersed public works.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our third quarter financial results.","James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Ward. The Building Materials business achieved products and services revenues of $1.1 billion, a 12% increase and at all-time record for the company. Gross profit increased 7% to $288 million. These results include a $61 million product revenue contribution from the acquired Bluegrass operations and adjusted gross margins comparable with our heritage Mid-Atlantic and Southeast operations.","Overall, aggregates product gross margin was 30.4%, which includes an $8 million negative impact related to selling acquired inventory after it was marked up to fair value as part of acquisition accounting. Excluding this impact, adjusted aggregates product gross margin was 31.6% or relatively flat compared with the prior quarter despite weather disruptions and higher diesel expenses that negatively impacted our quarterly cost and efficiency profile.","As Ward mentioned, our cement operations benefited from volume and pricing growth in Texas, leading to a 210-basis point expansion of product gross margin to 33.1%.","Magnesia Specialties once again posted record revenues and profitability as the business benefits from increased global demand for magnesia chemical products as well as strong domestic steel production. Operating efficiencies and lower unit energy costs contributed to a 370-basis point expansion in product gross margin to 39.2%.","During the third quarter, we commenced a planned restructuring initiative to consolidate 20 sites and the associated mixer truck fleet for Southwest ready mixed concrete operations. These actions are designed to improve the long-term profitability of the Southwest business. We incurred a $7 million restructuring charge, which was recorded in other operating expenses for the West Group, for related asset impairment and severance costs. This restructuring should pay for itself in less than 12 months.","Our strong cash flow allowed us to repurchase 305,000 shares of our common stock at a total cost of $60 million during the quarter. In addition to share repurchases, our board of directors approved a 9% increase to our quarterly cash dividend payment in August. This is one of the larger percentage increases in the company's annual dividend, and indicative of our positive business outlook.","Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have steadily maintained or increased our dividend, including throughout the long years of the Great Recession. We have now returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015.","We also made a contribution of $150 million to our qualified defined benefit plan during the quarter. As a result, this plan is now fully funded and we were able to deduct these contributions out of 2017 federal income tax return at a higher rate compared with the new lower corporate federal income tax rate for 2018.","For the trailing 12 months ended September 2018, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the applicable credit agreement was 2.72 times. We expect to be modestly above the top-end of our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times at year-end, remaining well within our covenants in our credit agreements. 2018 capital expenditures are currently expected to be $375 million down from our initial full year guidance of $450 million to $500 million. This reduction is largely a function of managing project timing as well as prioritizing projects focused on capital efficiency and higher returns.","Martin Marietta will continue to further shareholder value by opportunistically deploying free cash flow through growing dividends and share repurchases, as well as value enhancing acquisitions improving organic investment, all while returning to our target leverage ratio.","We remain on track to again deliver record revenues and EBITDA for the full year. As detailed in today's release, we updated our full year 2018 guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations. We now expect heritage aggregate shipments to range from flat to up 1% and heritage pricing to increase in the range of 3% to 4%.","On a consolidated basis, we expect total revenues to range from $4.135 billion to $4.255 billion and adjusted EBITDA to range from $1.100 billion to $1.145 billion.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ward.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thanks, Jim. We're confident about Martin Marietta's outlook given the disciplined execution of our strategic plan and our attractive geographic footprint. Looking ahead to 2019, we anticipate mid-single digit growth in both aggregate shipments and pricing. The demand for our construction materials combined with widespread customer optimism is strong and we see no signs these dynamics will abate in either the short or longer term.","Importantly, we have the ability and capacity to meet future market demands. Remember, our overall aggregate shipments are still 10% below mid-cycle demand with key states such as Georgia and Maryland, home to the majority of the former Bluegrass operations, along with North Carolina, 20% to 25% below mid-cycle demand. We fully intend to benefit from the strong underlying demand dynamics and believe the current construction cycle will continue to grow at a steady pace in 2019 for each of the company's three primary construction end-use markets.","If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions today. First, just focusing on the 2019 outlook, really a two part question. What gives you confidence for the mid-single digit volume and pricing for 2019? And then layering on that with the acceleration of public lettings in Texas, Colorado and Georgia, could you talk about the types of projects you're seeing are these overlay or larger type projects as extensively that would play into your 2019 outlook? Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Good afternoon, Kathryn. Thanks for your question. I think part of what you just said answers the first part of it. So, if we come back and say, looking at state lettings and contract awards in Florida, they're up 21%. In North Carolina, they're up 65%. In Texas, they're up 33%. So when we're looking at that type of activity in the public area where, as you know, over the last several years, it's been below 40% of our volumes, we think this is good evidence that it's heading back toward more traditional areas as well at least on a percentage basis, because as you recall, we typically range from 45% to 48%, not less than 40%.","So if we're looking at that and we expect more public activity, we think that's actually very good. We think in those states it's very good. Here's what we also see, we're seeing more design-build work and design-build work typically means larger, more complicated projects. In many places, we see this replacing some P3 work, which we actually think is really quite good.","So, from your perspective, Kathryn, they're larger jobs. They're more complicated jobs. Oftentimes, they have multiple primes. And those types of work are typically from the ground up. And what I mean by that is you'll see the entire array of aggregate products from base material at the very beginning of projects to clean stone as it's incorporated into asphalt or concrete as we go through. I think that's the biggest piece on infrastructure.","We also feel good about non-res and we feel good about res. If we're looking at the Dodge Momentum Index, that and the ABI both remain positive. We're looking at the next large wave of multi-year energy projects coming into Texas, really, as we go into 2019. And the other thing that strikes us is, in Martin Marietta markets, housing still remains very strong. We're looking at housing numbers this year that are still well below the 50-year average of 1.5 million starts. We see that there's not enough new or existing homes available to meet current demand. We're talking with homebuilders and listening to their commentary as well and they're seeing strong housing fundamentals.","And I think the other piece of it that's important is if you think about where the majority of our footprint is, it's southeastern and southwestern, and we feel like those geographies really offer superior opportunities for housing in the near term and the longer term. So I hope that answered both parts of your question, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","It did. And tagging onto infrastructure, aggregate shipments were flat in the quarter. Given North Carolina, Texas weather delays, if the weather had been sustained in July and August through September, any idea how shipments would've shaped out?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, I think if we had seen that go the way that we thought it would, I think shipments would have been up 12% for the quarter, and that's very much in keeping with what we thought. Seeing that type of a double digit performance for the quarter was wholly consisted with what we see in underlying market demand. And that's what gives us the type of confidence that we have looking into 2019 as well, Kathryn.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. And then shipments in the Southeast Group increased nearly 12%. Is this a sign we're seeing improved long-haul distribution in the Florida yards, is this a signal of easing of bottlenecks in rails or other factors? And maybe just, because rails have been such a focus for this year, any color on that would be very helpful. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Kathryn. I think it's twofold. Number one, business was better in Atlanta and we think that will continue to be the case. And number two, business was improving at the Florida yards. Florida DOT has a very good DOT budget this year. They're going to have a very similar looking budget next year. And obviously, the more we see going into Florida the better.","Keep in mind the southeastern pricing still would have had a headwind relative to more lower priced sand products coming into that market from offshore as well. So what I would say is, as we look at that overall market, we think it's attractive and we think it's early attractive.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. 12% heritage volumes in aggregates export, it was certainly very strong. Can you parse out what markets really stood out for you given some of the bottlenecks you were seeing in rail and labor? Is this level of shipments stable as we look at 2019?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Good afternoon, Phil. The markets that were particularly looking good, Mid-Atlantic was looking good; North Carolina was demonstrating good attractive growth. We were seeing good attractive growth in the Southeast. We were seeing attractive growth in Texas when the weather was dry and we were seeing attractive growth in the Midwest when weather was dry.","So as we look across the vast majority of our footprint, we were seeing good activity in all of them. And the other thing that I think is important, Phil, is as we look into 2019, what I would tell you is each one of our division presidents think that they're going to have a better 2019 than they did 2018. So, I hope that's helpful.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. And in your ready mix and asphalt business, margins were under pressure a little bit. Asphalt, I would imagine a good chunk of your business is more of a pass-through dynamic for liquid asphalt. Can you help quantify that and how quickly can you be caught up? And on the ready mix side, (28:09) was up, but did weather limit some of the momentum in Texas? And how should we think about margins there being all caught up? Thanks.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Absolutely. So, if we look at the ready mix business, what I would say is twofold. A very attractive healthy ready mix business in Colorado; we were clearly weather affected in Texas. You still saw volumes up in Texas despite the fact that it was the wettest September on record. So, I would say those would be the primary drivers relative to the Texas business.","If we think about asphalt all by itself what I will say is this, you had larger projects in Colorado this year, but there were fewer of them. So, you had large projects more focused around Denver. So, as a practical matter, you were seeing more contractors vying for fewer but larger projects. We think that rule is actually changing next year and we're likely to see much more work up and down the I-25 corridor, which is what we've typically seen.","You might have seen that, really, even as we got toward mid-year, the general tax revenues in Colorado were so attractive that Colorado was looking to let a good bit of work in calendar year \u2013 calendar quarter Q4 right now. So, again, I think that was the single largest driver relative to hot mix. And you also had liquid pricing moving up. I do think, in many respects, that's going to be helpful relative to hot mix pricing. That's not something we're particularly concerned about because most of our projects are indexed in that state, and we do have our own storage facility not far outside Greeley.","So, again, Phil, I hope that was helpful.","Philip Ng - Jefferies LLC","Very helpful. Thanks a lot. Good luck with the quarter.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Schrier of Citi. Your line is open.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Just looking at the aggregates margins and, obviously, there's a lot of noise in there with fixed cost absorption, efficiencies and costs. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about the overall environment, say, for markets that weren't impacted by weather or North Carolina, Texas when they were dry, of how did the price cost and how the operating efficiencies are looking in aggregates currently.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","When the volumes are working the way that we saw the volumes working in July and August, Scott, the cost profile, the pricing, everything else is actually working just as you would expect. You nailed it. The fact is, if you look at a North Carolina and a Texas, which are two outsized disproportionately important states for North Carolina, when those two have the types of events that we saw in Q3, we're going to feel it.","So, actually, as I step back and take a look at the business, recognizing what it had endured in those two states and the results that we put up, actually feel quite good about that. And again, I think to the extent that you believe as we do that 2019 is going to be a year where you see good volumes in those states. I think it actually portends very well for what we see in the year ahead.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then just following up on your earlier comments on design-build, obviously, you can control what you can control and there's a lot of external factors that have, I guess, you, us, investors, everybody frustrated with how volumes are going. And the one thing I'm thinking is it's really good that you're talking about these larger type projects. We see it in the transportation awards that the projects are getting larger. But, with that, does that carry maybe a higher tendency for certain projects to get cancelled or more lumpiness and ongoing delays?","I guess I'm just worried or concerned or what do you think that if we sit here 12 months today on the earnings call, the commentary will talk about what would have a lot of large projects and backlog, but these kind of projects get delayed. So just any color around how you see that playing out.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","My general view is design-build jobs are ones that we should celebrate, because if you go back to some of the things that I think you've heard from the industry over the past several years, at times, some of the holdups have been in getting design work out of DOTs because of labor constraints. I think to the extent that you're seeing large JVs come forward with design-build projects in today's environment, I think that actually serves to accelerate contract delivery and execution.","The other thing that I believe that I think is really going to help Scott is, keep in mind, the more public work we see going on, particularly design-builds or others, these typically will have good hard finish dates relative to them. And I think that's also going to keep good pace to the overall construction activity. You don't see that as much in non-res. You clearly don't see it as much in residential. So, as I look at a higher degree of design-build, I actually view that as good news for the industry and, in that context, I mean the building materials industry.","Scott Schrier - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi. Good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Ward, can you talk about the cadence of pricing that you've seen over the course of this year and what have you seen for aggregates, specifically in terms of competitor pricing discipline. How has the situation evolved this year compared to last year?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I think this year has gone \u2013 if you look at where we're guiding, we're guiding very much within the range that we talked about at the beginning of the year. What I'm seeing right now relative to next year actually looks to be a better environment in many respects because I think people recognize the underlying demand is so strong.","Here's something that we can look at internally, Jerry, and I think it underscores why we feel good about the pricing. We're going into 2019 with all of our downstream businesses having the largest backlogs in their history. And what we're hearing from many of our customers is they're in the same place. So, as a practical matter, it's not unusual for a sophisticated downstream customer to not want to run away from a price increase because, in many respects, that helps them in their business all by themselves.","So, at this point, we'll obviously come out later with more definitive guidance relative to pricing in 2019. But we're certainly seeing clean stone increases in many areas between $1 and $2 a ton. And I think that actually gives you a great snapshot of what we're hearing relative to demand and how people are looking at 2019.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And as you think about the cost structure from here, this year in a challenging weather environment, you're going to be growing EBITDA touch faster than sales. If we see the picture of mid-single digit volume and mid-single digit pricing playing out next year, I guess, can you go back to seeing EBITDA growing three times the level of sales growth or any moving pieces we should keep in mind about the cost structure in 2019 versus 2018.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, I think much of it goes back to some of the commentary that we made in the prepared remarks. And that is take a look at the part of the country that's still operating considerably below mid-cycle and if you start seeing the type of performance out of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and others that certainly population trends would indicate, those are some of the most powerful places in which we operate and that would clearly drive EBITDA in some very different ways.","The other thing that I'll remind you is coming into the year this year, obviously, cement has had, again, what I think is a pretty attractive year. But we also came into the year having done a large capital project on our Midlothian plant last year. And we were a little bit slow coming out of the gate in January and February in the cement market in Texas.","So, again, if you think about what I believe is going to be a very attractive Texas cement market next year and a very attractive southeastern and Mid-Atlantic aggregates market next year, I'll let you do the math. But, again, I think those are markets that probably help answer your questions as well as anything.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Wood of Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet","Hi. Good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hi, Mike.","Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet","Can you talk about industry bottlenecks, Texas in particular? I'm curious when pent up demand gets released in more normal weather, what are the industry constraints to growth in particular public spending and non-res?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I think, from our perspective, there is not any. So if you're looking at it purely from a Martin Marietta perspective, we can put on the ground whatever contractors require. I think one of the issues the contractors are working through right now is simply relative to labor and what's going on with respect to trucking.","And here are a couple of things that I would point out to. In a host of our markets, we're simply seeing contracts working longer hours and working weekends. That's not a surprise. The end of the year is coming. We're also seeing truck driver shortages being addressed in several ways. We see, in a number of markets, $1,000 bonuses being given to drivers. Drivers are being given free healthcare. But here are some stats that I think are important to keep in mind, Mike.","AGC put out a report in August of 2018 and 62% of contractors have turned to base pay increases because they recognize they need to get more people in to do the work. And I think if we come back and say, has labor been an issue for contractors through this year? It absolutely has. Has trucking been a shortage? It has. I think people are addressing it. One of our large contractors here in North Carolina would tell me he's going to have a record year and every day there are 10% fewer trucks available than he wishes. But that's not something that I think is going to persist.","So, again, I do think rail has also been a bit of a bottleneck this year. I do see that getting better. You can listen to the earnings calls from the different Class 1 railroads. I think they're very focused on dealing with this, and we do see progress in that regard. So are there bottlenecks? There are. Are they on our end? They're not. Do we see them in large part getting better? We do.","Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet","That's helpful. And since it's election day, are there any mid-term votes that you're watching in terms of state level infrastructure propositions that you might want to call our attention to?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","What would tell you is, let's all watch that together. I think ARCO (38:44) would tell you that there are over 300 ballot initiatives on various ballots today. That gives you a great feel for simply how many projects there are out there and how many jurisdictions are looking at it. One of the things that we would just watch, because we're curious, we're anxious to see how things go in Colorado this evening. We think Colorado is going to be in a great place if nothing happens. But, keep in mind, there are two different ballot initiatives in that state this evening. One inspirationally called Let's Go, Colorado, and the other a little bit more bluntly, Fix Our Damn Roads. So we'll watch that carefully and see how that shakes out.","Michael Wood - Nomura Instinet","Great. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is open.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, there. Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Quick question on the CapEx spend and the deferral piece. Does that slip into next year? How do we think about CapEx? And I guess the root of the question is that you're too 7-ish right now, I mean it's not hard to think that you guys could get below 2 times in terms of a net debt-to-EBITDA next year and I'm just trying to frame up some of the casual implications.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Look, I'll address the CapEx, then I turn it over to Jim to give you a little bit more color. Here is what I would say, look, we've been spending CapEx above DD&A for the past several years. And I think we've actually spent it very well. I think if we're looking at something below $400 million this year as we really look at the full year, I would tell you that's probably not a bad ZIP code for you to start thinking about next year as well.","We're going to be focused on CapEx that really gives the type of return that we expect and you would expect, so we probably will see that dial back just a little bit. But I know your question was more than just about CapEx, so let me turn the balance of it over to Jim to respond.","James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. So, Stanley, the company's capital allocation priorities are unchanged. The first call on capital is the right acquisition that will enable our successful execution of our growth plan, followed with investing in business in organic growth and CapEx that Ward mentioned being relatively constant for the next year. And then beyond that, returning cash to shareholders through a meaningful, sustainable dividend, all while targeting \u2013 and the share repurchases, all while targeting our 2 to 2.5 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio.","Just going to point out, in the last six months, we've completed the second largest acquisition in the company's history, which was all cash and debt financed. Since then, we've de-risked the balance sheet, paying down debt and funding our qualified defined benefit plan. Additionally, as we mentioned, we bought back shares in Q3, $60 million worth. It's been about 11\/2 years since we repurchased shares. So we're back in the market. We also increased the dividend 9% this August. So, we're feeling very good about our future.","And with the equity market sell-off of late, we view our shares as cheap and we'll be actively considering share repurchases. We'll be opportunistic with a balanced approach with our cash flow. But, again, given our positive outlook for the future and our expectations for growing earnings, share repurchases will be funded through cash flow from operations going forward.","We are focused on lowering our leverage to within our target ratio. We're going to keep strengthening the balance sheet. But, again, given the cheap stock price, we're going to be looking at that as well. All in all, we're taking a balanced approach and we expect to fund the needs of the business, repay debt and repurchase shares, all while de-levering over the next 12 months.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","And Stanley, I guess the punch line is we've got a high-class problem. I think we're going to be in a place that we can fund our CapEx the way that we need to. I think we do transactions really well.","I think we've got a team that not only does the transactions themselves well, but I know we have an operating team that makes them perform extraordinarily well. And again, being in a position that we can take a look at share buybacks and doing things like we're doing with the dividend puts us in a very attractive spot and we're going to enjoy this and take advantage of it.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, no doubt. And then the aggregate pricing sounds very good. Cement pricing, you talked about the $8 per ton. Can you talk about kind of the confidence? Sometimes the cement pricing tends to be a little more volatile, I guess. What are you seeing in the Texas market that gives you confidence that the $8 is a good number for us in the coming year?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, what I would encourage you to do is just do some other channel checks and get a sense of where you think competitors are there as well. And my guess is you'll get some comfort when you look at that. That's certainly what we're seeing is as we hear from customers and others in that marketplace.","I think the other piece of it goes back to some of the commentary that I offered before, and that is the downstream business' backlogs are really very, very high. And this was a year in which cement was relatively tight in Texas. I think you could certainly see that next year as well. And again, the location of those plants and where I think we are in the cycle is what gives me the type of confidence around that that I have as we go into 2019.","Stanley Stoker Elliott - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Perfect. Appreciate the time and congrats on a nice work in a tough year.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you so much, Stanley.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research","Hi this is Jeff Stevenson on for Garik. My first question is on weather impacted markets and how long North Carolina, for example, takes to normalize. Do you expect this to potentially bleed into next year? And if so has it factored into your guidance?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I don't think it's going to bleed into next year. Obviously, it significantly affected the quarter. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, we did have two quarries in the eastern part of the state that ended up being a catcher's mitt for a lot of floodwater. What I'll tell you is, sadly, we have gotten pretty good at this and we build up inventories at those eastern locations recognizing that if a hurricane comes along we need to be able to sell material.","So I don't think we're going to be in material shortage land around either Belgrade or Castle Hayne. Those are the two quarries had been filled with water. We are undertaking pumping at those quarries. My guess is, if we're looking at Belgrade, it's probably four months to six months to get the water out of there. Castle Hayne actually has a little bit more. It has about 8 billion gallons of water in it. That's probably going to be closer to six months to nine months.","However, I do not anticipate that being a market situation as we go into next year. We're going to have to run some pumps. That's going to cost us modestly more money for some period of time. But I don't see that being something that if I'm you and I'm modeling out 2019, I'm not putting that very high on my worry list.","Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research","Great. Great. And I just had a question on incremental margins for next year. With the potentially stronger demand environment and relatively easier comps, could there be any upward bias?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Well, again, I'll take you back to geography. We will give you a good view of 2019 when we come out in February, so I don't want to get too far over my skis right now. But, obviously, what we see right now for 2019 looks attractive and I like the geographies, Jeff. So I'll leave it at that for right now.","Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research","Okay. And then lastly, cement guidance was put down slightly, I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on the buckets driving that?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I think primarily it was September rains. That was your big single issue. But I know Jim had some comments on cement as well.","James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","If your question's on Q3, it was September rains, if your question's on Q4, it's the rains we've already seen in October so far for Texas.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","So we've tried to take everything we've seen into account with a full year of the little bit that's left in 2018.","James A. J. Nickolas - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Right.","Jeffrey Stevenson - Longbow Research","Got it, thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Your line is open.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Hey, good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Hello.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Ward, I want to start first on the ready mix pricing, which increased over $5 sequentially, just curious what drove that.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","I'm sorry, what my take was on that?","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","On ready mix pricing, yeah.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I think, clearly, you've got a very attractive ready mix market in Colorado with high barriers to entry and a very good ready mix business. I think, clearly, we were seeing the type of increases in Texas that you would expect to see, given the types of backlogs that are there and what I think can be a tightness in that market in many respects. So, I think in most regards, Adam, it's the sign of a good healthy marketplace with good underlying demand. So, I think those are your primary drivers.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","So there's nothing unusual in Q2 that can stay at that level.","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","No, there was nothing unusual in Q2. In fact, the things that were unusual in Q2 or Q3 were more things in our face, not things at our back.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","And then the aggregates pricing for 2019, how does that \u2013 does that start to flow through mostly in January next year?","C. Howard Nye - Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.","It varies. Some price increases will go in in January, some increases may go in in April. Look, if you're sitting where I am and where you are, you've got a bias toward January. My guess is most will go in January. I think a good number will go in April. And the simple fact is, construction doesn't really get underway in earnest until the second half of March. So it's more of an optical issue than a real issue, but I think you'll probably have most go in in January, you will have some that will go in in April.","Adam Robert Thalhimer - Thompson Davis & Co., Inc.","Perfect.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to host Mr. Ward Nye. You may begin.","Ward Nye","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials quarterly earnings call. With me is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer. We're pleased to share our second quarter 2012 results, and our expectations for the full year. Before we begin, let me remind you that this is discussion may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, or future operating or financial performance. Forward-looking statements in this discussion are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Except that's required by applicable law, Martin Marietta takes no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise.","Martin Marietta refers you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release, relating to our second quarter, 2012 results, and to Martin Marietta's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be found on the SEC's website. Finally, any references in our discussion to margin are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. This is also explained in our SEC filings. ","For the second consecutive quarter, our Heritage Aggregates business has reported an increase in operating margin, expanding 150 basis points in the second quarter 2012. This expansion was driven by our Heritage Aggregates product line, which reported a 2.8% increase in shipments; and a 2.4% increase in pricing. Underscoring this performance, are signs of recovery in certain of our markets, predominately in the western United States. These trends, along with the recent passage of a multi-year federal highway bill, and regionalised improvement in home building, have provided optimism for future construction activities. We also continue to be pleased with our specialty products business, which established a new second quarter record for net sales, and once again, generated impressive margins.","The volume momentum generated in the first quarter, for our Heritage Aggregated product line shipments, continued into April and May. In fact, Heritage shipments for the two month period ended May 31, increased 8% over the comparable prior year period. In that volume environment, we generated an incremental gross margin consistent with our expectations. Predictably, in markets with more notable volume growth, we generated an incremental gross margin much higher than 60%. As an example, our Des Moines, Iowa district experienced a 16% shipment increase for this two month period; and generated an incremental gross margin of 75%. However, in June, certain project delays and economic uncertainty led to a 5 1\/2% decline, in Heritage shipments compared with June 2011.","This erratic volume pattern, together with planned inventory control measures; diluted the incremental gross margin gains, that were achieved in the first two months of the quarter. We see consistent indications of recovery in our West group, which reported a 7.6% volume increase for the quarter. Shipments were notably strong in Texas, and Iowa. The Texas market experienced robust construction activity, including increased shipments to both the energy spectrum, as well as the residential end use markets. ","Our mid-west division, particularly Iowa, benefited from mild winter weather, which facilitated to an earlier start to the construction season, and allowed for significant progress on several projects. Including the expansion of Highway 20, also known as the Midwest Connector, in western Iowa. Heritage Aggregates volume in our mid-east group increased nearly 8% for the two month period ended May 2012, as compared to the prior year; driven by strength in our Indiana and Ohio markets for major highway projects. However, June volumes declined over 4%. Primarily as a result of project delays in North Carolina, which are expected to defer certain shipments to the second half of the year.","Overall, our mid-east group reported a 2.9% increase in Heritage Aggregates product line shipments for the quarter. Our south-east group experienced a 10% decline in Heritage Aggregate product line shipments, due to economic conditions, lagging national trends, which is largely attributable to weak job growth and continued high foreclosure rates. We're pleased that three out of four of our end-use markets reported Heritage Aggregates product-line volume growth. Shipments to our Heritage infrastructure market increased 3% over the prior quarter. This end use, which accounts for more than half of our aggregates product line shipments, should benefit in the future from the recent passage of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st century act, or MAP 21; which is signed into law earlier this month. ","MAP 21 is essentially a final three month continuing resolution to the previous highway bill, through September 30; followed by an abbreviated two year highway program. We believe the new law, which provides highway expenditures of $40 billion annually, will create a higher degree of fiscal certainty for states, counties, and municipalities; compared with a series of shorter-term continuing resolution in effect, since 2009. Furthermore, MAP 21 provides for expedited project approvals, eliminates ear marks and embraces more private sector involvement, all of which we believe will be positive for our business. Aggregates product-line shipments to our residential end-use market, increased 8% in the prior year quarter.","This growth is due to a 40% increase in shipments to the energy sector, which are primarily reflected in our west group results. Our Heritage residential end-use market continued its recovery from depressed levels, has experienced a 21% increase in aggregates product line shipments over the prior year quarter. This growth reflects the increase in National year-to-date housing starts, and was noteworthy in our Charlotte, Kansas City and San Antonio markets. ","Finally, aggregates product line shipments to our heritage ChemRock\/Rail end-use market declined 19%, driven by the unusually strong balance volume in the second quarter of 2011, as well as project delays related to rail track maintenance schedules. We anticipate certain of these shipments to be recovered in the second half of the year. We continue to see positive construction trends in the Denver market, as previously communicated, when we exchanged our river assets for assets in Colorado, we increased our exposure to winter weather. The front range of the Rocky mountains experiences a later start to the construction season, than markets along the southern portions of the Mississippi river. Still, the Colorado operations once again, outperformed our expectations for the quarter, and had break even operational profitability, generating EBITDA in excess of the previously mentioned river markets.","The average selling price in our heritage aggregates product line increased 2.4% over the prior year quarter. The west group reported the highest increase, 5.4%, which was supported by pricing in south Texas, to the energy sector. These shipments are primarily from sales yards, which have a higher average selling price, compared with producing queries; due to transportation costs from our producing locations to a sales yard. Our product aided the 4.7% heritage aggregates product line pricing increase for our southeast group, we're none the less pleased to see price increases in all segment markets, despite the groups growing decline.","Finally, heritage aggregates product-line pricing for our mid-east group declined approximately 1%. This reduction, however, reflects changes in the geographic mix of shipments, which further lower the average selling price variance by 240 basis points. For the overall aggregates business, which includes the impact of the Denver market, our aggregates product-line average selling price increased 1\/2%, over the prior year quarter. Remember though, that aggregates product-line shipments in the Denver market, reflect lower average selling prices compared with the company average, due to both geographic and product mix. ","As we've previously discussed, it's reasonable to expect a 30% to 40% difference in sales price, driven by these mix issues. Proper inventory control is an important operational discipline. During the quarter, we adjusted production and reduced our heritage aggregates product-line inventory levels. The inventory reduction lowered gross profit by $8.4 million compared with the prior year quarter. Our operating teams continued their focus on cost control, limiting the increase in heritage aggregates product-lines cost per ton, to 1%, inclusive of the impact of reduced production volumes. Also, reversing a multi-quarter trend, energy costs benefited from a slight reduction in diesel fuel prices, and remained essentially flat compared to the prior year quarter.","Our average price for diesel fuel was $3.03 per gallon, compared with $3.08 per gallon in the prior year quarter. Our specialty products business benefited from strong demand for both chemical and dolomitic lime products, and generated net sales of $50.4 million; which represents the second quarter record. Despite increased direct input costs, this business generated an operating margin of 34.6%. On a consolidated basis, gross margin was 20.8%, a 300 basis point decline compared with the three year prior year quarter, primarily as a result of the inventory control measures discussed previously. ","We continue to focus on what we believe is industry leading performance in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. In that respect, these expenses declined 40 basis points, as percentage of net sales. The absolute increase o $4.3 million is due to incremental overhead incurred in our Denver operations, and costs related to our planned information systems upgrade. We expect improvement in SG&A expenses in our Denver operations, since we continue to integrate them into our disciplined cost structure.","Consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $59.3 million, inclusive of $9.2 million of business development expenses; excluding the $0.12 per-diluted share charge for these expenses, our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.92 for the quarter. Inclusive of these expenses, earnings per diluted share were $0.80, compared with $0.78 in the prior quarter. For the first six months of the year, cash provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of business development expenses, was $52.6 million. Days sales outstanding, was 43 days, an improvement compared to 2011. ","We continue to invest in the new lime kiln being constructed by our specialty products Woodville, Ohio facility. We expect this project to be substantially completed during the fourth quarter, and thereafter generate annual net sales ranging from $22 to $25 million, with margins comparable to current levels. During the first six months of the year, we invested $66 million in various capital initiatives, including $22 million for the new kiln. We also maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share. At June 30, 2012 our ratio consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA, was 3.63 times in compliance with the limits under our debt covenants. We remain optimistic about our performance in the second half of the year. We continue to expect our infrastructure end-use market volumes to range from flat, to down slightly. We anticipate double-digit growth in non-residential shipments, driven by increased energy sector demand.","Residential shipments are expected to increase at a higher rate, compared to the level of improvement in 2011. Finally, we expect ChemRock\/Rail volume to range from flat to down slightly, depending on the timing of the previously mentioned [inaudible] projects. Overall, for the full year, in our heritage aggregate product line, we expect volume to increase 4% to 5%, pricing to increase 2% to 4%, and direct production costs to be flat. SG&A expenses, exclusive of the incremental expense for our Denver operations, and costs related to our information systems upgrade, are expected to decline slightly compared with 2011. Earnings for our specialty products segment are expected to range from $68 to $70 million. ","We expect interest expense to remain flat this year, our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%, exclusive of discrete events; and capital expenditures are fore-casted $155 million. This CapEx estimate includes the remaining capital for the new kiln at our specialty products business. We look forward to building on the positive first half trends, in the second half of the year. We remain confident that our disciplined operating approach will deliver results, that enhance long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. The operator will now give the required instructions, we'll be happy to address your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnold Ursaner, of CJS Securities. Your line is open.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Hi, good afternoon Ward. My first question is the 60% incremental margin target that you had spoken about previously, you mentioned that you had it in April and May. Do you have any reason that your target of 60% incremental margin is not achievable on a go-forward basis? Maybe expand on some of the factors behind it.","Ward Nye","Sure, Arnie. Thanks for your question. The short answer is we continually believe that the 60% incremental margin is attainable, with volume recovery. If we look at April, volume recovery was up 8.8%, if we look at May volume was up 7.3%. So if you look at those two months, as we discussed, it was 8%. The fact is, we believe strongly that we can hit those incremental margins, when we watch the next, call it, 40 millions tons come back. Keep in mind, we're 80 million tons away from where we were at peak. Oart of what's important here though, Arnie, is it does have to come back across the enterprise, and that's really part of what we were seeing in April and May. The other component that I would remind you of, and we discussed this before. Markets like North Carolina and the southeast are dis-proportionally profitable markets for us. So, when we're looking at volumes down 10% in the southeast, and when we're looking at what was a challenging period of volume for north Carolina, those two markets do tend to put a particular drag on that incremental margin target. But again, if we see volume come back across the enterprise, we're very confident in that incremental margin target.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","My final question if I could. I think you said $8.4 million hit from the planned inventory reduction plan. Can you give us the quantity or the tonnage, decline that you had from inventory? Perhaps walk us back through the math around the $8.4 million item you mentioned.","Ward Nye","I can certainly take you through that. What we're talking about Arnie, is basically a reduction in inventory of about 3.5 million tons. So if you take a look at the production tonnage that we had in Q2 '12, versus Q2 '11, we actually produced less tonnage in '12 than we did in '11. We took our inventory volumes down by 3.5 million tons; so fully call it 10% of the heritage volume, worth of volume, just went out. Frankly, came out of inventory. Keep in mind, when you're working in a volume environment that we're in today, you're probably running with fixed costs somewhere near 70%. When you're in that type of volume environment, with that type of fixed cost structure, when you do bring volumes down, you're simply going to feel it to the tune of that $8.4, $8.5 million. So, from an operating perspective, it was entirely the right thing to do. We've discussed where we've been with inventories for some time, but hopefully that put some metrics to it.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Thank you, very much.","Ward Nye","You're very welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil, with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Good afternoon.","Ward Nye","Hi, Todd.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Let's talk about the second half of the year for a minute. Obviously there's a fair amount of concern about the macro economic environment. You guys kept your guidance unchanged. You talked a little bit about the second half and sort of what your specific expectations are there. Can you give us a feel for what's underlying that, and what you're seeing that makes you feel as confident as you seem to be in that?","Ward Nye","Sure. Well, Todd, as you recall, we indicated we though volume would be up 4% to 5%. If we take a look at really, the bottom end of that range, and what it takes us to get there. I'll try to take you through the different buckets, and give you a sense of that. We expect an infrastructure of slow downs in the second half, so we're actually showing second half volumes down in infrastructure, down around 1.6%. Now non-res, particularly driven by energy had a nice first half. We saw that volume up around 12%. Based on what we're seeing right now, we think that will likely replicate itself again, in the second half. If you look at res, res was up 15% in half one, and obviously there's a lot of activity in res right now; at least comparatively. We're actually seeing res, in our numbers, slow down in the second half. If there's some place where there may be some upside, I think candidly, that may be it. We saw res up 15%, half one, we're showing  it up only 9%, half two. Then if you assume that we're not going to see the same level of down in ChemRock\/Rail; in half one, we saw that down 9%. We're seeing that down 2% in half two. That at least gives you some degree of book-ends around the different percentages that we're talking about, and the different end uses. If I come back and take a look at those, none of those percentages seem to be particularly unrealistic to me, Todd.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","That's great. Thanks for that. You mentioned 2013, in your press release, when you were talking about MAP 21. I can't resist taking the opportunity to ask if you want to give us an early indication on what you think next year might look like. Whether it's for infrastructure as a result of that, or just broadly speaking.","Ward Nye","Well, you can't resist, I probably can resist, Todd. Actually Todd, I do think the highway bill, is clearly going to be something that's helpful to this industry. When Secretary LaHood came out with his announcement around much of that, he said that he thought this was going to give some degree of interest, to an area that truly has [inaudible] and I don't disagree with that. As you recall, for the last couple of years, about the only sector of our business that we said we thought had [inaudible] demand, was in ag-line. I do think there is [pinup] demand around the larger multi-year projects, and I think what we have in MAP 21, at least giving a clear two year snapshot of what we have, is going to be helpful. Keep in mind, I didn't think we would see a highway bill, so I think this is a better place than I thought we would be. I think that in addition to the flat funding, I would suggest to you Todd, that it's pretty good. I think if you look at the reform provisions that are in it, those are going to matter, I think, quite a bit as we go through. I would particularly encourage people to look at the TIFIA program. Because that's going to end up, I think, putting a considerable amount of money out there, that people will be able to use. You can look at the projects that have been bid in the TIFIA program since 1998, they're simply going to be much more robust, going forward. In fact, again, I think it was last Friday, LaHood announced that there would be immediately available $17 billion of TIFIA loans. So by the time you end up putting the leverage amount to that, you can have something coming out of TIFIA, I believe, that can be much more important to the industry, than for example, the prior stimulus bill was.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","That's great. Thanks for that.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Todd.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee"," ","You had talked about the possibility of medium price increases this year. Are you seeing that come through the way you anticipated? ","Ward Nye","You know what? We have certainly seen mid-year price increases. They have not been across the board as much as they would have been last year, at least by market. We've seen increases in certain markets in the east, primarily for ready-mix stone. We have seen mid-year price increases as you would expect in portions of the southwest. We've seen price increases in San Antonio, we've seen fine and course aggregate pricing go up, in some places as much as $1.00 a ton. In Houston, we've seen mid-year price increases on aggregates anywhere form $1.00 to9 $1.50 a ton, we've seen sand and gravel go up in that market as well. We've seen similar price increases in south Texas. The one area in Texas that we have not seen the mid-year price increases stick, is in DFW. As you recall, we're not really the market leader in DFW, but we've certainly seen what we believe, is productive mid-year price increases in San Antonio, Houston and south Texas.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Great. Final question from me. In the inventory reductions, can you just talk about what drove your decision to make that? Was it particular product and market driven? Going forward, are you looking to produce in line with shipments, or are there further productions to come? Thanks.","Ward Nye","It was not driven by any single product, Todd. It was really across the spectrum. What I would suggest to you, is as volumes come through next year, particularly after MAP 21, I think you'll see more of a draw down in base products. This is simply the way we run our business, this is not unusual for us to go and adjust the inventories down. We'll continue to watch what we thin shipments are going to be, and we'll try to manage that in a way that we think is responsible. So, I don't want to sit here at this moment and tell you exactly what our plan will be, because we will watch that as the year unfolds.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thanks, very much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rodny Nacier, with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, good afternoon everyone.","Ward Nye","What's up Rodny.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","You had highlighted in your prepared remarks [inaudible] during the second quarter, and as I'm thinking about your guidance of 4% to 5% for the full year, could you perhaps break out on a regional basis, your outlook for the segments?","Ward Nye","I'll try to break it out on an end use basis. Really, if we look at the way the trends are going right now Rodney, clearly I think we can all say the west is going to be a more robust area for the country, for the rest of this year, than the east is going to be. I think, at the same time, if we come back and look at our mid-east group, the deferrals that we saw of some volume in the mid-east, particularly in north Carolina, is fairly notable. If we took a look at some rather large projects, there's a fairly large project on I-5 crossing the Yadkin river, that was delayed. We've seen some lining projects on I-85 around Charlotte delayed. We've seen some delays on highway 311, which is going through the middle of the state, really, in Randolph County. Even as we get to the eastern part of the state, there were some delays on the Welmington Bypass, and of course, we've had good military work throughout our enterprise, because of our different locations, and we saw some delays at Camp Lejeune. So if I come back and say to you, broadly, we do anticipate volumes to be stronger in the west, we do anticipate seeing a stronger second half, clearly in the mid-east, and I think the area that's simply going to lag is what we're seeing in the south-east right now. I think that's driven by a number of different factors. I think the economic factors in the southeast are pretty powerful. ","If we just take a look at what employment situations are like right now in Florida, Georgia and in south Carolina; looking back where they were at peak, and where they are today. They're 55% below peak today. In Georgia it's down 37%, north Carolina 34%, south Carolina is down 40%. At the same time, housing, which is driving a lot of the activity in many parts of the country. Let's celebrate the fact that it's up 28% right now, but at the same time, on a seasonally adjusted rate, that's 780,000 units; versus a norm of 1.4 to 1.5 per annum. I think if we look at the southeast, and here's a factoid for you, I think we can tie it back in, very directly, apply it to our southeastern lag. If we look at 1,000 homes in the US, what you can assume is around 4.3 of those homes are in some degree of foreclosure. That's not a very heartwarming statistic, and it gets even uglier when we talk about Georgia and Florida, because Georgia has got 8.3 of them in some degree of foreclosure, out of 1,000, and Florida at 8.6. So, I try to give you at least some data, that I think comes back to underscore what we said in the west, and the mid-east, and the southeast, Rodny. The one thing that I would say is this. It's been remarkably dry in portions of the west,  this year, and in particular parts of Iowa. I think that may end up putting some degree of duress on the agriculture community there, if they don't get some rain soon. Of course, what that can actually do is impact your AG line volume at the end of the year. So, Rodny I hope that was helpful.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","That was very helpful. Not to focus on the laggard here, but looking at the southeast segment, with volumes down 10%, just looking at the restated volumes that you have, it was on a pretty similar comp to the first quarter. So, the first quarter was up 5%, and this quarter was down 10%. Was there anything specific, that happened this quarter, that really drove that market to just deteriorate, at a faster pace? ","Ward Nye","I don't think there was anything horribly specific. I think there were several things that are rather general, and I think one of the issues that we need to watch, is what happens today in the state of Georgia; because that is when we're going to see what the full results are, on the 1% sales tax that Georgia is trying to put in, in [inaudible] districts. I think, clearly not having a good viable funding mechanism in the Georgia DOP, is something that does cause them some concern. The other issue I would mention, and we didn't put in the press release, and I didn't put it in my prepared remarks because it's an outdoor sport. I mean, you did have a tropical storm that came through, Debbie did come through in June; and to say that Florida and Georgia escaped that without any effect, would be entirely right. When storms come through, you just deal with them.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","All right. Thank you. That's very helpful.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Rodny.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T. Your line is open.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Good afternoon, Ward.","Ward Nye","","How are you doing, Jack?","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","","I'm doing all right. Thanks. What do you think happened in June? I mean, seems like declines were fairly widespread and was it something you guys saw coming or did it catch the industry a bit by surprise?","Ward Nye","","I think perhaps the degree to which there was a decline. I think it caught the industry by surprise. I think when you're looking at double-digit numbers down in Georgia and you're looking at double-digits down in part of North Carolina and double-digits down in South Carolina, I think those are bigger numbers than what people would have expected.","At the same time, when I remember that we're talking about North Carolina and South Carolina and Georgia, those aren't states that you would expect to stay down. These are states that have broad, good, solid economies. But I think to answer  your question directly, Jack, it was a deeper fall in June, but I think people would have expected.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","And with regard to the residential piece where are expecting not quite a gain in volume in the second half versus the first. When I look at the housing starts in single-family starts, there, right now anyway, at the highest level of the year. So as your guidance there reflects some of those market specific factors or just more of some conservatism, even given that housing has gained a little momentum lately?","Ward Nye","I think that's a fair point, Jack and I think that the comments will filter around that in the earlier Q&A was. I think if there's a place here that we probably benefit punitive to ourselves, it may well be on the res side. I was out in San Antonio here a few weeks ago and I was in Florida for part of the other week, as well, and, Jack, what I'm seeing is I'm seeing activity in the field that feels like, in some respects, that I'm back in 2006.","We're seeing people cutting in new subdivisions. It's not just that they're building homes, they're paving streets, they're building sidewalks, they're putting in curb and gutter. So I do think the housing piece is a very good story right now and I don't want to soft sell that. I think that is good and it's clearly more important to this industry than I think people would have believed.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Sure. Well, it's been a while since we've seen it, obviously. And I'm pricing, you mentioned some of the markets where pricing has been good and you're getting some mid-year price increases, but you've also said on this call, as well as for, I think, a few quarters at least, that it is choppy, I guess, maybe is the word or sporadic in terms of the ability to get pricing. There still some important markets out there where pricing is somewhat competitive and that's, if it happened in the wrong market, it can really affect margin. I mean is that something that you're dealing with?","Ward Nye","","No, and I wouldn't say that it's hard to get price. I think what I'm more saying is in some markets it's not as easy to get a mid-year price right now, Jack.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Okay.","Ward Nye","","If I'm looking at our pricing again in a very tepid volume environment, realistically this is still the way I measure it, a pretty good story.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T Capital","Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Jack.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","","Thank you. I just have a follow-up question with respect to the inventory control measures you took in the second quarter. I was wondering if you could break out, perhaps, by reason how much of $8 million was spread across where?","Ward Nye","You know, well, Garik, I could probably go back and take a look at that. I can't break that out for you right now and give you a good spread of exactly where that was. I don't think there was any particular area that really drove. I think we pretty much did that across the portfolio. I think there might have been a little bit more east of the Mississippi, but as a practical matter we also had better business west of the Mississippi, but I think that's probably as good as I can give you right.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. And then, I guess, as we think about the close margin in back half of the year, looking for a mid single-digit volume growth, some pricing lift. All things being equal, especially with diesel tapering off, could we expect gross margin expansion year-over-year in the back half of the year, meaning some of these revenue growth opportunities will more than offset some of the negative mixed issues that you're seeing geographically?","Ward Nye","Garik, I don't think that's something that you should dismiss at all. I think that primary driver is going to be volume and where the volume is. I think those are going to be the two issues that, if I were you and it being me, that those are two things that I'm going to watch. How much and where.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. Fair enough. And, I guess, just a question on non-residential demand. The (inaudible) energy has been very strong for you in the first half of the year. I just wondered may be if you could provide some color on what you're seeing in the more traditional and non-res end markets, office and retail, end markets like that?","Ward Nye","It continues to get better, but I will tell you it's getting better from a very, very, very low point right now, Garik, and we're seeing that better in a number of markets. I'm seeing that better in Ohio. I'm seeing it better in Indiana. I'm seeing good warehousing distribution. I'm seeing portions of that in the Mid-Atlantic and we're clearly seeing good activity along those lines in places like Kansas City and in the Western U.S.","So, if we come back and really look at what non-res, really more the lighter side of it is doing, we're seeing better activity than we've seen in a long time; Florida probably being one of the few places right now, on that piece, of still not an enormous amount of activity.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. And then, I guess, this question is just housekeeping. I was wondering if you could provide the number of gallons of diesel you consumed in the second quarter?","Ward Nye","I can. It looks like in Q2 we consumed about 7.5 million gallons of diesel fuel. So for half one we were 13.5 million gallons, and, just so you'll know, usually Q3 is our highest diesel fuel consumption period.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Great. Thanks so much.","Ward Nye","Sure, Garik.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","","And I thank you for taking my questions today. I was going to see if you could just give me a little bit more clarity on volumes on apples-to-apples basis just to reconfirm you're gaining about 8 million tons in fiscal '12 from Denver and taking out about 6.5 million from other divested assets and other related assets. And taking those to account, how did the Denver assets perform on a year-to-year basis versus your core asset base volume performance in the quarter?","Ward Nye","Sure, Kathryn. Let me address that. Actually, what we've said before it the 8 million tons that I think you're referencing is not just Denver. That's the cumulative tonnage from the acquisitions last year. So that would include Denver and it would include San Antonio.","But let me do this, let me come back and try to help you a little bit on Denver because I can understand that that's something that you want to try to bring some clarity to it. If we look at it for the quarter, we shipped around 1.6 million tons of aggregates in Denver. It was around 485,000 tons of hot mix and around 230,000 cubic yards of Ready-mix and generated approximately $60 million net sales from the acquired Denver business.","So if we look at that we had something in Denver for the quarter that really getting its lights under it. It was EBITDA positive for the quarter and, again, part of what we're intrigued by like and what we're seeing in Denver, Kathryn, is the rate of growth in highly construction awards in Colorado as ranking among the highest in the country and also looking at what their relative to decreasing construction-related unemployment is pretty impressive. Colorado added jobs at a rate of 4.2% versus the national average of 1.9%. And that's really going back even to the last question. This is one of the markets where we're seeing a nice uptick in non-res and residential construction.","And to give you more of a sense of it, during the quarter we bid on nearly 1,200 different projects in Colorado, up and down the front range. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense of how that market is starting evolve and growing into something that we thought it would, but it also gives you some volume and some revenue metrics around Denver. The other thing that I would point out to you too is if you went back and took a look at the way the TIFIA program has worked, even historically, Colorado's been one of the better states at coming up with projects of a national or regional significance and getting (inaudible) dollars put into those. Is that something to say all you need, Kathryn?","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Yeah, and I was just looking at Denver. How much is that non-res demand is really more energy driven versus your core, kind of, other category in non-res?","Ward Nye","You know what? Actually, not a lot of it is purely energy driven there. I mean, what you'll see coming out of there is really going to a (inaudible) deposit and the type of tonnage that we would see going to (inaudible) compared to anything that we might be seeing in the Barnett, for example, which way down, or the Haynesville, which is down, or even the Marcellus, that we don't have the huge presence in. It's not as much as we would see in any of those other deposits.","So when we're talking about non-res in that market, it truly is what you would think about it. It's the Westin that's going up at the Denver Airport and it's other projects of that nature.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Okay. And doing the pricing, how much does mix account for in the upside in the quarter?","Ward Nye","You know what, it really doesn't count for much of the upside. In fact, mix was clearly a headwind on what we experienced in the Mid-East. The only place that we got really a tailwind that was appreciable on mix was in the Southeast where I want to say we up, what was it 4 and some percent, and I want to say it was around 200 basis of that that was a positive mix effect. Aside from that, it wasn't a great moment for the quarter.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","And then going back to inventory reduction, even if this had been for good or for ill kind of an issue for the industry in general, really since the stimulus program got going and had having to battle through base inventories. Here's my question to you, I think it's great you're EBITDA, focusing on inventories, but, and you talked a little bit about it earlier in the Q&A, but maybe you can help me understand a little bit better inventory, particularly basis, has been an issue for the downturn. Why maybe focus a little bit more in this quarter or is there an opportunity maybe to unload a type of inventory that you hadn't had the opportunity before because of different demand trends?","Ward Nye","No, the demand trends didn't change from our (inaudible) plan and Lord knows the problem with the industry right now is there's not enough opportunities to unload volume anywhere right now, Kathryn. That's the real challenge that we're faced with. And simply recognizing that, to your point, if you're going to be in a mode for much of the last several years that you're producing principally a clean washed stone material. You were going to build some other inventories. You are doing to have to go back and run your plants at times in a different mode and you will build up some inventories and you do  have to manage it.","So there was nothing that was particularly magic about this quarter, it's obviously easier to the extent that you're going to sell out of inventory to do it when you feel like you're in the right season to get much of that done. So that's simply what drove it.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Okay. Great. And, finally, is anything on the impact of the drought on your ag line business?","Ward Nye","It's hard to say that there will or won't be an impact right. That was really just going back to what we've felt like the puts and takes and maybe with respect to volume later in the year. Obviously, we've had a couple of good years of ag line volume. I think the need for ag line in many respects is still there.","At the same time, if the crops end up, in large part, being subject to drought and the farmers find themselves in a more distressed place at the end of the year, then they won't buy as much ag line. That's simply the way that market works. I don't think we're to the point that any of us can say that that's where the farmers are, but at the same time, I think that's something that they are probably watching right now. If they are, we are.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Ward Nye","Sure, Kathryn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Thank you. Hi, guys. How're you doing?","Ward Nye","Good. How are you?","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Great. So I had a quick question. I apologize if I missed, but on specialty products, revenue up 2%, gross profit better at 7%, operating profit down 9%, margins down 420 basis points. You know, so, otherwise, revenue up $2 million, profit down $2 million. You say that higher raw material costs, I think contract services and repairs, I wondered if you could give us a little better sense for what the raw material issue was in the quarter? How to think about? If it's a cyclical issue? If it's something other than... is it natural gas, is it some other raw materials and starting point?","Ward Nye","Well, to tell you the truth, really, Ted, is we went back and looked at that. Some of it was simply in supplies and explosives. Some of it was in repairs. Some of it was just in pure maintenance. We had some issues with respect to lime, but at the same time the issue that we're faced with right now is a few hundred thousand dollars here, a few hundred thousand dollars there, you get up to something that, $1 million, $1.5 million.","I don't think it's anything that's really likely recur or be that notable. At the same time I think you and I both look at those margins and take them every day of the week and that team has done very well.","The one thing I will say to you is that nat gas has been our friend up there. If we look at the way nat gas has worked historically, we had looked at the energy profile for that business, nat gas clearly would have been the single largest component of that and as we sit there today, coal and electricity and nat gas really on a percentage basis are all about the same for that business right now, so.","It wasn't any one thing, Ted, it was just a series of smaller things that, as I've looked at them, and as John Harmon, who runs that business very well for us, looks at them, we're not particularly alarmed by what we saw.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay. So not to nag on it, but I agree. It's a phenomenal business. So it's been extraordinary to the downturn and upturn, but just when it comes back to thinking about the profitability on a go-forward basis, it's a business that's historically put up some really impressive incremental in the 50%, 60% range and you had 220% decremental this quarter. And so just in terms of calibrating our expectations, I know you reaffirmed the $68 million to $70 million of pre-tax profits, but it's still a pretty big swing.","So if you start heading up a couple hundred thousand dollar things here and there, you still come to a $4 million net swing, revenue up 2, profits down 2.","Ward Nye","All right. I understand where you're coming from. If I really was concerned about it, to your point, I would have gone back and changed the guidance. I feel confident that we'll be where we are. Still's running at a 77.8% capacity right. Obviously, the input cost with respect to natural gas are in a very attractive place compared to history.","We're right on time, right on schedule, right on dollars with the kiln project, as well. Ted, I don't see anything there that for the full year is concerning to me. I feel very good about it.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Great. Because I know you mentioned 77.8% capacity (inaudible). Could you just tell us what it was last year? (inaudible)","Ward Nye","Last year the numbers run 74.5.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Oh, wow. Okay. So nice improvement.","Ward Nye","Yeah.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Great. And then I apologize to go back, I just wanted to touch on the incremental margins in aggregates. I know there was mix, there's the inventory issue, and you talked about giving 60% incrementals in April and May. Was that on the business on a reported basis or was that really the underlying aggregates when you strip out the downstream stuff and any other noise?","Ward Nye","Okay.  That was on our aggregates business and the way we report our aggregates business is really if we're looking at... I'm just thinking through it, Ted, there's no downstream, at least appreciably in the east, and, obviously, there is in the west. So what we're talking about on that is the incremental margins with respect to the ags business across the group. So ag rock only.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay. The last thing I just want to ask and then I'll just hand off the baton to somebody else, but the (inaudible) costs, can you just talk about kind of what's driving the upgrade. I think what involved your guys as having kind of best of breed technology. Just wondering what exactly you're doing with the total cost will be and how should we think about payback and the anticipated benefits?","Ward Nye","(audio difficulty)","Can you  hear me?","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Hello?","(audio difficulty)","Ward, I apologize I don't think you can hear me, but I think something is wrong with my line because I can't hear anything. I'm just going to hang up and they can circle up offline. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Security.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Security","Hi. Can you hear me?","(audio difficulty)","Ward Nye","So all told and $8 million upgrade investment, which is simply standard due course and something that we are prepared for and, obviously, we feel like the way we run our business and the importance of our systems is an important and critical investment.","Operator, if you can still hear us, I'd like to go to the next call.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Mike Betts of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","","Yes, hello. Can you hear me, Ward?","Ward Nye","The good news, Mike, is I can hear and I'm sorry for whatever happened there. I'm glad all of you could continue to hear us.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Yeah, I'm not sure we could, Ward. I mean maybe I could ask first just simply because I think you broke up to everybody. If you could just summarize. You came back in on the $8 million upgrade on the IT. Was there anything else crucial that you were saying in that? I think we missed that.","And then my specific questions were the kiln in the (inaudible) products that's opening later on this year, I mean should be we expect any dilution in margin. I mean should we expect any dilution in margin as that kiln ramps up? I mean will it take some time before it comes up to full production?","And, secondly, you've not talked about your lime volume inventory and I know you won't give specific numbers and this stage, but this is basically the trend continued the way it's been in June or is there anything significant that's changed in July in the aggregates business versus June? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Mike, thank you for your questions. Let me go back and try to address the systems question one more time just in case I was cut off and, again, I apologize for whatever technical issues we ran to.","On that, it's simply an upgrade to our JDE system. We're looking at about $1 million a quarter for '12 and for '13. So, in other words, it's about an $8 million investment to upgrade that system. So we'll just leave that there.","With respect to July, what I'll tell  you about July when we're sitting down at our next quarterly call I'll give you a quick update on that, but, obviously, right now that's not a conversation we feel like is appropriate for us to go into.","With respect to the new kiln, obviously, what we feel like we can do there is we can bring capacity into the market and the capacity has already got a home in large part in the market. We feel like we will bring the process online here in the fourth quarter. We think we will go through the debugging process and actually what we would anticipate is coming into 2013 with margins coming out of that kiln that very much marry up to what you've seen come out of that business heretofore.","So, we're not seeing what we believe will be any degration in that business at all from a margin perspective.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","You don't see even in Q4 when it first starts to come on?","Ward Nye","You know, you can certainly have some degree of debugging for a brief period of time. That would not be wholly unusual again. It is a kiln process, but, Mike, based on what we've seen on the project based on the conversations that we're having regularly with our teams and based on the track record that they have I don't want to spread anything that would be material.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And then just one final question, Ward, If I may. I think you also altered the guidance slightly on your heritage (inaudible) production cost from the decline to flat. Was that just the inventory issue or was there anything else behind that?","Ward Nye","No, Mike, it was primarily the inventory issue. You're exactly right.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Thank you very much, Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of DA Davidson. Your line is open.","Brent Thielman \u2013 DA Davidson","","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.","Ward Nye","Sure, Brent.","Brent Thielman \u2013 DA Davidson","First on Texas. You mentioned some of the strength in the energy sector in residential and I'm just wondering, have you seen the public side slow at all in that market or is it just more steady as it goes?","Ward Nye","You know, I'll tell you, the market in Texas just feels pretty good right now. I mean there's just no doubt about that. I mean if we look at the 12-month contract awards, it's around $4.9 billion. What I'm hearing, and obviously that's an August fiscal year state. I mean they have it come out exactly what their budget's going to be, but I'm certainly hearing budgets out of (inaudible) or spending that could be well in excess of anything we've seen the last several years.","So we're looking at something that we think in Texas, for the next 18 to 24 months, just on the public infrastructure side, is likely to be very strong. At the same time, if you're looking at markets like San Antonio, the residential recovery has been really something to see. I mean home values hit a two-year high in June, multi-family continues to be a 93% occupancy rate and if we look at just new projects we added there for the quarter, I count up nearly 11 new projects that we added just in San Antonio.","At the same time we know the Eagle-Ford deposit is booming. I think one component that will likely come out of Texas that I'm not sure everyone completely appreciated, is how many secondary or foreign market roads are being absolutely destroyed by the activity that's going on in the Eagle-Ford shale deposit right now. So by the this process is done it won't just be stone going into the shale fields, it will be stone going into the roads that need considerable repair.","And then even if we look at places like Houston right now, we're looking in the core development that's launching generation part that's a $5 billion development there. Exxon-Mobile is looking to put a new chemical plant in Mont Belvieu and, of course, the Grand Parkway that's going to be a 38-mile project, $1 billion of The Woodlands are all very considerable projects, many of which has strong commercial components to them, as well. So what we're seeing in Texas right now is a beautiful thing. We just wish we saw it in other markets, as well.","Brent Thielman \u2013 DA Davidson","That's really helpful. And then just a clarification in the other big market, North Carolina. Were all the project delays sort of weather associated or were there any issues there?","Ward Nye","I don't think weather had that profound an impact in North Carolina. We did get some rain in June that probably delayed some of them. I think much of it, you look at it and we look at it too in terms of what's it looking like this quarter. I think most owners and most DOTs aren't necessarily looking at it that way. They're looking at it more within the confines of a construction season. So I think to the extent that we saw something or you may see something pushed to the right 45 days, that's a much greater moment to people from the outside looking in than it is to a DOT or an owner. ","So I don't think there was anything fundamentally or structurally that was different. I think we're just seeing the good and sometimes the not so pretty components of the way constructions works.","Brent Thielman \u2013 DA Davidson","Got you. Thanks a lot. Best of luck in the second half.","Ward Nye","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Desi DiPierro of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Desi Dipierro - RBC Capital Markets","","Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned each of the volume rates of April, May and June and it appeared that things kind of got worse as the quarter went along and you said that the 5.5% decline in June reflected project delays and economic uncertainty. Are you able to breakout what portion of that you think is more due to project delays or a deteriorating economic environment.","Ward Nye","You know it's hard break that out. I think as we look at a market that clearly matters a lot to us and that is North Carolina. I think some of the larger projects that we would assuming would go were simply project delays. So I think as we're looking at the East Coast, that the Mid-Atlantic, that's really more of the issue because we're seeing good steady business in Indiana and Ohio, primarily driven by highways. The driver in North Carolina would continue to be highways, although we're seeing much better economic activity around Charlotte than we've seen for a while, as well.","I think back to my earlier comments, I think the issues in much of the pure Southeast, and by that I mean Florida and Georgia, and Georgia, in particular, are more driven not so much by delays, but by what's going on in that economy and I hope that geographic divide was responsive.","Desi Dipierro - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah. That's good. And then also, obviously, you didn't product Southeast would be down 10% this quarter when you issued your previous guidance of plus 4% to 5%. And since you're maintaining that is that assumed that the other areas are doing better you guys initially expected?","Ward Nye","You know I think clearly the west is having a very robust year. I think, again, as we look at what we have in backlogs and it's one reason that I try to go through each end use segment as carefully as I did and speak to the very specific increases or decrease in the infrastructure component, for example, that we thought we might see in the second half to show you how that build would be to get to the bottom end of our range. We're comfortable with where we sit right now.","Desi Dipierro - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Sure. Thank you, Desi.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stanley Elliot of Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Stanley Elliot - Stifel Nicolaus & Company","","Great. Thank you very much. Back to the TIFIA program, it doesn't sound like there's going to be much of an impact this year with your outlook for the back half of the year, but the way that the modifications that they made this program, can you all expect that kind of have sort of the same benefits as the regular (inaudible) 21 program when construction season starts in the first quarter, second quarter or is this more of a longer term type situations because of the partnerships being involved with all that?","Ward Nye","I think anytime its tied to this type of a build its going to be longer term by nature and so I think if we go back and think about it. I would saw we haven't talked much about (inaudible) because it hasn't been that big of a deal, but [TIFIA] has been around, as I understand, originally since 1998.","So, if you go back and take a look at some of the projects that we benefited from, particular with respect to TIFIA, and we'll continue to, I mean, in Denver we're seeing U.S. 36 and managed lanes project. TIFIA was actually some of funding for the Denver Union Station and Texas, it's money behind the 635, which is the LBJ managed lanes projects. Also, the North Triangle Expressway.","And even here in North Carolina on the Triangle Expressway, which was our first modern toll road that had TIFIA dollars in it, as well. I mean clearly we're looking at what, $750 million of TIFIA dollars of '13, $1 billion next year. So $1.7 billion. If the secretary's numbers are right and you put a ten time multiple to that, that's $17 billion of TIFIA loans.","And I think part of what's going to be remarkable as we watch TIFIA, I think this is going to be important to see is the maximum potential TIFIA share of project costs have basically gone from 33% to 49%. So in other words, its possible to take that $17 billion and assume that you might even see a distal leverage put to that and I think if we start looking at a $2.00 to $3.00 form of leverage, even of that $17 billion, that goes back to why I feel like TIFIA in the final analysis may well be more profound than even stimulus was coming into the sector. I think TIFIA is going to be something to watch. I many what LaHood has called it is the largest infrastructure loan program in history and that doesn't sound like a bad right now to me.","Stanley Elliot - Stifel Nicolaus & Company","Nope. Not at all. Great. Thank you very much.","Ward Nye","Sure, Stanley.","","Operator","","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll hand the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.","Ward Nye","Well, thank you again for joining our second quarter 2012 earnings call and your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. We're encouraged by the first half trends, particularly the passage of a new highway bill and anticipate building on this momentum throughout the year into 2013 and beyond.","We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2012 results with you in November. Thanks for your time today and for your support of our company.","Operator","","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today. You may all disconnect.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to your host, Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, we've made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information, which we believe will be helpful. As detailed specifically on slide two, please remember that today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially.","Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Also, as a reminder, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are explained in our supplemental financial information on our website and in our SEC filings.","As detailed in the release we distributed, Martin Marietta delivered record first quarter results, reflecting strong operational performance as we began to reap the benefits of a more favorable, broad-based construction-centric phase of recovery and some geographic areas and expansion in others.","Our impressive first quarter numbers included record net sales, record net earnings, consolidated gross margin expansion of 790 basis points and an increase in earnings per share of nearly nine times the $0.07 reported last quarter.","On a consolidated basis, our operations achieved a nearly 70% incremental gross margin, another notable highlight is our nearly 20% gross margin, mirroring the level attained in the first quarter of 2006, a time when the overall economy was near an all-time highs and annual housing starts in the United States were nearly 2 million units. To deliver a similar performance in 2016, with an economy only in the early stages of construction recovery in many of our key markets, is indicative of the strength and benefit of our geographic positioning and strategic planning.","Against that backdrop, the aggregates product line delivered robust volume and pricing growth of 13% and 8%, respectively. The Mid-America Group lead with a 28% increase in aggregates product line shipments. This performance was driven by the commencement of several large, principally state-funded highway projects across the Carolinas, together with increased residential and non-residential construction activity. The West Group reported a 5% increase in shipments and an 11% increase in average selling price.","Of particular note for the quarter, North Texas aggregates product line shipments and volume and pricing increased 28% and 12%, respectively. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex is the fastest growing area in Texas, and one of the top nationally for both employment growth and residential construction. Additionally, the Texas Department of Transportation has announced construction plans in excess of $8 billion per annum over the next several years. This program, which together with the funding provided by the North Texas and Harris County Tollway Authority, should lead to further growth in customer backlogs, our attractive leading Texas market positions will allow us to capitalize on these opportunities for the balance of the year and indeed for years to come.","In addition to volume growth in the quarter, we benefited from a stronger pricing environment. Simply put, aggregate pricing is up broadly across the company's business. The ready mixed concrete product line enjoyed strong demand and much improved operating conditions in Texas. This two-fold combination drove 31% increase in shipments and a nearly 12% increase in average selling price.","The result, a 46% increase in net sales and an 810 basis point improvement in gross margin. Texas-based ready mixed concrete operations are expected to contribute significantly to full-year profitability, following a profoundly weather-impacted 2015 that effectively masked the potential of this TXI-acquired business. The stated aim and expectation is for profit margins in the Texas ready mixed concrete business to rival that of our Colorado-based business.","We see these early 2016 results as a good start toward the fulfillment of that goal. As a result of the September 2015 sale of our California cement business, comparability of results for the cement segment will be affected throughout the year. The 2015 impact of the California cement operations is detailed on slide five.","Our remaining cement business, which is entirely in Texas, benefited from considerably-better weather, but importantly strong demand, which is forecasted by the Portland Cement Association to continue for the next several years. For the quarter, the business generated nearly $70 million of net sales, and $33 million of gross profit. This translated to a 47% gross margin, which increased over 1,000 basis points as compared to the prior-year period. EBITDA for the cement business was $37.8 million, a 37.5% increase from the prior-year quarter.","Lastly, the Magnesia Specialties business delivered record first quarter net sales of $59.5 million. The Magnesia Specialties team continues to diligently manage the cost profile of the business, and despite U.S. steel capacity utilization being nearly 2.5% lower than the prior-year quarter, our business delivered gross margin expansion of 430 basis points to a first quarter record, 38.6% gross profit margin.","Looking at our entire business, given the strong first quarter performance and increasingly positive outlooks for the Southeast, most of Texas, and our downstream businesses, we have raised our full-year EBITDA guidance. We now anticipate a range of $1 billion to $1.05 billion of EBITDA, with increased profitability and margin expansion expected across nearly every business line.","The broad-based acceleration in construction recovery is visible in all three primary-induced markets. Again, first-quarter growth was driven by large projects in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups with a 25% and 11% increase, respectively, in infrastructure shipments.","Notably, important cities in the Carolinas are enjoying the benefits of this trend. Places like Charlotte are benefiting from the new I-77 HOT lanes P3 project and ongoing work at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Also, Charleston, South Carolina, has significant port growth as well as strong attendant infrastructure development.","Similarly, in the Southeast, the long anticipated I-4 activity in Florida contributed to the positive quarter-over-quarter change. Overall, aggregates product line shipments to the infrastructure end use market accounted for approximately 39% of our shipments and increased 13% over the prior-year quarter.","We're encouraged by solid growth across this end use market, resulting from state-level funding initiatives passed just last year. With the acceleration of projects in North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa, combined with another year of robust Texas Department of Transportation program lettings, we expect continued meaningful demand growth.","The non-residential end-use market comprised of two components, light construction and heavy construction, accounted for 33% of quarterly aggregate shipments and increased 14% as compared with the prior-year quarter. The light component is primarily office and retail, with demand generally tied to employment growth and residential demand.","Consistent with the drivers, light non-residential aggregates volumes increased 20%, led by nearly 26% growth in the Mid-America Group. Following several years of modest recovery in this area of our business, strong employment growth and residential activity in North Carolina is driving increased non-residential construction investment.","The heavy non-residential construction component is primarily industrial building, as well as energy and energy-related activity. These shipments represented 24% of quarterly aggregates product line volumes and increased 12% compared with the first quarter of 2015.","The residential market accounted for 18% of quarterly aggregates product line shipments and reported a 20% increase compared with the prior-year quarter. Strength in housing activity is evident across the United States, as housing permits, starts and completions are each up more than 10% for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016.","Although U.S. housing activity remains well below historic averages, the reacceleration of growth in our key states, particularly in the southeastern portion of the country, is expected to drive increased aggregates demand throughout the year. The chem-rock\/rail market accounted for the remaining 10% of aggregates product line volumes and increased slightly.","Consolidated gross profit margin was nearly 20% and expanded by the previously mentioned 790 basis points over the prior-year first quarter, reflecting margin expansion in all reportable segments. Robust demand and much improved weather conditions drove significant growth for the ready-mixed concrete and cement businesses, which increased gross profit margins by 810 basis points and over 1,000 basis points, respectively.","To summarize the growth in our consolidated results, first-quarter 2016 delivered record net sales of $734 million, an increase of $102 million, or 16%; gross profit of $145 million, an increase of $70 million, or 95%; record earnings from operations of $84 million, an increase of 228%; and EBITDA of $153 million, an increase of 67%. Net earnings growth drove a 91% increase in operating cash flow in the first quarter, to $67 million compared with $35 million in the prior-year quarter.","During the quarter, we repurchased an additional 1 million shares of our common stock, in line with our stated capital allocation strategy, and together with our dividend, we returned $176 million to our shareholders. We have authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our stock. Since the initial share repurchase authorization in February 2015 through the end of the first quarter 2016, we repurchased 4.3 million shares, returning nearly $670 million to shareholders. As a result, 15.7 million shares remain under the current authorization.","Finally, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 2016 was 2.1 times, in compliance with our leverage covenant and in line with our targeted leverage of 2 times. As we also noted in today's earnings release, we have upwardly revised our 2016 guidance for aggregates volume and EBITDA. Our improved outlook reflects additional strength in underlying demand and increased margin expansion from our original projections.","We're confident that continued positive employment growth in our key markets, strong contractor backlogs, and normal weather patterns will drive more than $1 billion of EBITDA in 2016, a new milestone for Martin Marietta. You will also note that we increased our expectations for public sector growth from mid-single digits to mid-to-high single digit volume growth in 2016.","The growth reflects continued state and\/or municipal-level funding initiatives that are positively impacting several of our key states, including Texas, North Carolina, Colorado, Iowa, Georgia, and Florida. To conclude, we are very pleased with our first-quarter performance and improved expectations for the balance of the year.","We're positioned to deliver record results as we continue to recognize the considerable benefits of our unwavering focus on our leading positions and economically-diverse, high-growth markets. We remain committed to the diligent execution of our strategic plan, steadfast to our core foundational pillars, and dedicated to delivering increased shareholder value.","If the operator will now give the necessary instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. The first is going to focus on margin, excuse me, the guidance that you gave for quarter, first on end-market growth projections and then shifting to margins. But in light of Q1 results and infrastructure non-res growth rates that you outlined in your guidance, and granted you did bump up your infrastructure end-market guidance, but the projections seem to be \u2013 could potentially be conservative in our view. What is your best estimate as to the pull-forward in demand from Q1 from just easy comps and extremely warm weather throughout the U.S.? Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Kathryn, thanks for your question. I think, as we look at Q1 and we look at the rest of the year, and I think the primary things that I would say to you, it's Q1. So really we're not going to look at Q1 and let that necessarily dictate the way the entire rest of the year looks. To answer your question very directly relative to what we saw as pull forward, as you recall when we ended the year last year, we thought we had probably 3.5 million to 4 million tons of aggregates that we felt like had some form of deferral because of the remarkably wet weather that we experienced in 2015.","Our best estimate is we saw about a 1 million ton pull-forward in Q1. Our guess as we are looking forward is that's probably not a bad number for you to think about relative to Q2 and Q3 with the number then getting marginally smaller as we go into Q4. So again, from a timing perspective, based on what we see on infrastructure, we just feel like it's the first quarter, again trying to address the other piece of your question, what did we see pull forward, trying to address very specifically what we saw in the quarter and what we anticipate in the quarters going forward.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. And sticking to the theme of infrastructure, and in particular, visibility, this is something you know that we've been focusing on for quite some time in certain states, some of which you noted on the call including Georgia, North Carolina, past changes in how states fund \u2013 approach funding infrastructure projects. Are you yet seeing the impact of those dollars flowing through? Or realistically is this something that you'll start see flowing through later this year or even into next year?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I think the answer is, yes, Kathryn. I think it depends on the states. I mean, here's the way for you to think about it. North Carolina has put forward a budget that could add up to $1.1 billion through the biennium. And what we saw after North Carolina did that last fall was the acceleration of about 90 projects in North Carolina, some of those were going out as far as 2025 and even beyond.","So, we are seeing that type of pull forward, not just here in our home state. We're seeing that to a degree in Georgia as well. Governor Deal came forward with his series of projects that he would like to see accelerated. So I think we will see some of that this year. If you recall, last year, we had seen the gas price \u2013 the gas tax go up in Iowa that was going to add about 30% of what that state DOT could do.","We've also seen some near-term initiatives in Nebraska that'll clearly be more profoundly felt next year. We've also seen good activity, not just at the state level in Colorado, but we've also seen it at the municipal level in Colorado. Colorado Springs has put some very specific plans in place that would help drive volumes we feel like in Southern Colorado to a degree even this year.","So, Kathryn, what I would say our state and local initiatives helping in some places now? Yes. Will that continue, I think, to be even more profound as we go into next year? I think the answer to that is yes as well. Remember, to the extent that we get benefit from the FAST Act that's going to principally be a 2017-and-after event. We will likely feel some of that in some discrete markets this year. But we will likely feel more state impact in those markets and then probably the one-two impact of that beginning more in earnest in 2017.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","And I'd assume that's the same for Texas Prop 7 which dollars hit in September this year so it will more be a 2017 impact...","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","If you recall, that's actually next year, Kathryn. So you're going to have a Prop 1 effect that will go through this year. Prop 7 is actually coming in really beginning September 1 of 2017. So that's how you're going to see that transition there.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Okay. Great. And final question is on margin guidance. Was a little ahead of our expectations, which is all a good thing. Maybe if you or Anne could go through the levers that drive the upside to your margin guidance. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You know, Kathryn, it's just a couple things. One, volume always helps and more volume in the East always helps, too. So if we come and take a look at really what had happened if we're just looking at margin guidance in the Eastern United States in particular, if we're seeing volumes obviously moving in a better direction, in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, that's an awfully nice help.","The fact is, if you look at incrementals for the business, we were right on target or ahead of target if you look at the numbers that we put forward. But interestingly, if you take a look at Mid-America, that group had margin improvement to 46% versus 37% in the first quarter of last year, but here's the trick to it, Kathryn. The Mid-Atlantic division was almost 70%, Mideast was 42% and the Midwest, really this time of year doesn't make any money because they're caught up in winter.","So again, as we're looking at the type of improvement that we think we can see, where that's going to come from is going to matter. The other piece of it that matters is we were able to operate remarkably more efficiently in Texas, simply because it was dry. So if you pull together two different things, one, more normalized or friendly weather, which helps, and then a certain degree of geographic mix that helps as well. The simple fact is, Kathryn, we could do something this quarter we haven't been able to do in a while.","We had a dry track to run on and we just put the rings down and let the horse go and when you do that, those are the types of results that we think we can see.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Kathryn, it's Anne. I think the supplement that you'd \u2013 we saw good profitability coming out of the ready mixed concrete business, and so that business line margin expanded as well as out of the cement business. So it really was across the board and I would say Magnesia Specialties delivered a strong quarter and probably slightly ahead of our expectations for the year. Principally, energy, our steel demand at about 70% utilization, which is a critical factor, favorable natural gas costs, and then incredible cost control by that group of managers.","Kathryn Ingram Thompson - Thompson Research Group LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Timna.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello. I wanted to get a little bit more color on the timing of the diesel tailwinds that have been helping and assuming more flattish prices going forward, is that a factor? And maybe margins tailing off a little bit, if you could elaborate on what you're seeing in diesel?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I guess a couple of things, if we look at diesel, Timna, we used just about 10 million gallons of diesel for the quarter. And if we're looking at the prices, about $1.84 a gallon and keep in mind that does include the cost of the fixed price hedge if we have in that. So really if we look at it and think of it in our numbers, the hedge actually gave us about $4.5 million headwind as we are going through the quarter.","As a reminder, the hedge wraps up at the end of this year. But if we also look ahead, I can give you a good sense of what gallons looked like last year. We did 9.9 million gallons Q1 this year versus 9.2 million gallons Q1 last year, and Q2 last year, we did a little bit more than 11 million gallons; in Q3, it was almost 12 million gallons; in Q4, it was a little bit over 10.1 million gallons for a total of almost 42.5 million gallons.","So that'll give you a sense of it. The other thing that I would say is if we're looking back to Q1 last year, diesel was at $2.04 versus $1.84 this year, and if somebody had told us last year in Q1 that we would still have energy as a tailwind and a friend overall, I'm not sure I would've believed it, but here we are.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for that. On the specialty \u2013 on the Magnesia segment, I was a little confused by the comments because steel demand is pretty low as you've mentioned and then you had pretty solid results. So just wondering is that a structural changes, have you done some cost-cutting? Or does this mean that you can have higher profitability at a lower steel utilization going forward?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","If you think about it, Timna, the primary thing that we said are two things really drive that business, if you've got steel utilization at 70% or better, and if you've got natural gas prices that are well behaved, those two things will help that business pretty considerably.","If we're looking at what the cost of nat gas was, that was down about 32% for the quarter. So nat gas was giving that a tailwind, but even while steel was down 2.5% versus where it was last quarter, it was still at that 70% number that Anne referenced in the last conversation that we were just having with Kathryn. And candidly 70% isn't an overheated number. I mean we've built that business with that very capable team recognizing that 70% was probably a pretty safe number to have out there.","And look, are we awfully proud of seeing margins at 38% when you've got steel at 70%? I think those are tremendous numbers and I think that team really should take a bow. So were we pleased with those results? I would say, very pleased. Have we changed anything structurally? The answer is no, we really built it to make sure that those levels would operate very well with where we wanted to take the business.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Well, just to supplement that, Timna, dolomitic lime really is the principal product that goes into the steel industry. The mag\/chem business is actually seeing some good solid demand across really all the geographies that we serve, which is, as a reminder that is an international business.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. If I could get one last in. I just wanted to know if you could characterize what you're seeing in M&A, because there's been some small deals and obviously your cash position is great. So just wanted to \u2013 or your balance sheet position in general \u2013 wanted to just get a sense of how are you are seeing the M&A environment for now. Thanks.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Timna. We have a very busy team in strategy in development, so they are looking at a number of different transactions today. I think what you saw us announce at the end of last year and what you've seen us announce early this year, are the types of bolt-on transactions that you should expect us to continue to look at. Specifically, I'm talking about what we did in Southern Colorado simply as an example. Those are markets that we feel like are going to be attractive near term and long term.","So you should expect us to be active, looking for though importantly the right deals, because I think we're in a coveted space. I think we're in a spot that we can participate in deals. We can add synergy to those deals, but we're also in a space that we can buy back our shares as well. And there are not a lot of companies who can do that one-two punch that we can offer right now. So that's our take on M&A as it pertains to third parties and M&A as it pertains to ourselves.","Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Timna.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Thank you. Congratulations on a nice quarter.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Garik.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Sure. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on the gross profit guidance within the aggregates product line. If I could, you raised your volume guidance by about 1.5 million tons, kept the pricing guidance the same, but the profit guidance was raised by about $55 million. So if you take the volume increase and apply the full drop-through, it would be about $20 million. So I was just wondering if you can maybe provide a little bit of color. You talked about efficiencies. You talked about geographic mix. But how should we think about the maybe the $35 million bridge from the growth in revenues versus the growth in profits that you are expecting?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Garik, I think you've hit the two drivers, very candidly. I think we anticipate if we have normal weather, the efficiencies will be much better, and that's a powerful lever. I don't want to undersell that lever. I think candidly the more powerful lever right now is what's going on in Georgia, what's going on in Florida, what's going on in South Carolina and what's going on in North Carolina. And keep in mind what you haven't really seen in any significant material way yet is what we feel like is going to be a pretty busy year in Indianapolis, in our Mideast business, and it's likely to be a very busy year in our Midwest business as well.","Garik, as I sit here and really just think about our aggregates business and take a measure of it, what I would say to you is, it wouldn't surprise me at the end of the year to have a record year in the Rocky Mountain division. It wouldn't surprise me to have a record year in our Midwest division. I think we're going to have a record year in our Southwest division. We're going to have a remarkably better year in our Southeast division and we're going to have a remarkably better year in our Mid-Atlantic division, and candidly it's possible to have a record year in our Mideast division. So if you're thinking about those different divisions, which ones of those are pure aggregates and the sheer number of those that are now transitioning to the eastern half of the United States, I think that type of activity both from an infrastructure perspective and frankly other perspectives combined with higher efficiencies really drives that delta that you're seeing in profitability.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Garik, just to add a little color to that, our first quarter margins of 20% and then drilling down into the aggregates business even more, we actually had some acceleration of stripping cost and repair and maintenance cost in the first quarter, as our teams in the field are prepping for what they think, for the backlog that's out there for the balance of the year. So, part of that margin expansion and efficiency too comes from a lot of those costs that have been incurred, and like Ward said, ready to let the horse run.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. That sounds good. Thanks for the detail. Just wanted to follow up on cement. It seems like you won back market share in the first quarter. I'm just wondering how you feel your market share is positioned right now as you look at the Texas cement market through the remainder of the year. And then also you did reduce your cement pricing guidance, so I just wanted to see how you are anticipating the April price increases to go and what that means with respect to the market share question that I asked previously.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I guess a couple of things, Garik. If we go back to the conversation that we had in February, and I think in large part the first quarter, I think the term we used was shaking out. It's probably shaking out about the way that we thought that it would. I think we said we thought it would be an easier or better pricing environment in North Texas than it was going to be in South Texas, I think that's been entirely true. The Comptroller is very helpful in putting out the different numbers that the marketplace can see. That 21% market share or in that ZIP code is not a place that we think is a bad place for our business to be.","I've also referenced the fact that we, I believe, can be a remarkably efficient producer of cement in that marketplace as well. I think one reason that you saw a modest pull-back perhaps in the pricing is, we've seen relatively good activity on volumes, as you saw. And what we've also done is we've had some wholesale sales, particularly in that North Texas market to other producers that are in that marketplace, and the wholesale prices clearly go at a different number.","So, if I'm looking at probably about 40,000 tons that we sold in the quarter that were wholesale tons, and then take a look at really what were some product mix issues, simply really selling more customers pick-me-up product, FOB the plant, and I would say that was more driven in South Texas than it was driven in North Texas. And then back to, as we discussed in February, there are some competitive dynamics there that we're sensitive to. I think when you tally those together, it brings you to the point that you see in the full results. What I believe is, if we have the weather in Texas that I think we're going to have, I think we're likely to have a very active year in Texas. I like the way I'm seeing our ready mixed business run. Frankly, I like the way I'm seeing other ready mixed businesses run in Texas right now.","I think the fact is, it's pretty conceivable that you could have cement shortages in Texas as we get to the main part of the year. And I'll let you draw your own conclusions on what that may mean relative to cement pricing going forward. Again, as we're looking at this business from an efficiency perspective, on pricing, and really running it for profitability, I'm very comfortable with where that is. The other thing that's interesting to me, Garik, is to see what's going on with cement pricing in other parts of the United States as well.","So, if I'm looking in places like Colorado or the Carolinas or otherwise, I'm seeing cement prices in those markets that are at times $25 or more a ton of where we sit in Texas right now, which gives me a sense we've got some nice runway ahead of us on this. But keep in mind, as we take a look at where we sit on pricing in cement in Texas today, we're 20% up in South Texas from where the prices were when we combined with TXI, and we're 30% up in North Texas, from where prices were. So, I've tried to give you some context. I apologize for the length of my response. But I think the context is important.","Garik S. Shmois - Longbow Research LLC","I appreciate the color and congratulations and we'll see you next week in Dallas.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Garik. Look forward to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good afternoon, Ward and Anne.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jerry.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm wondering if you could talk about how you expect the pricing cadence to play out over the course of this year. Last year you opted for a major price increase on January 1, and I'm wondering if you see potential for sequential price increases this year as we go through the year.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","And then we're talking aggregates, Jerry?","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In aggregates, yeah.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As I look at aggregates pricing, here's what I would say. We've got 17 out of 20 districts where it's just remarkably positive. We've got almost half of those where it's up at least $1 a ton and several districts where we're up $2 a ton.","So, we're seeing nice price movement in really important markets. The only markets where we're not seeing remarkable price movement, it's fascinating to me we got some freight adjustments that we had to deal with in some and we simply have some mix issues in others. So, I'm looking quarry-by-quarry, product-by-product. I'm seeing good price increases in all of those.","What I would say, too, Jerry, is we're in a marketplace where volumes continue to go up. So pricing, as you know having watched us go through the cycle behaved exceptionally well even in a down market.","From where I'm sitting right now, Jerry, I think trying to measure it going forward, if FW Dodge is a good indicator. Dodge right now is looking at three good years ahead of us right now. We probably would've said the same thing last year and that was before we ended up with a five-year highway bill.","So, as we're sitting here, Jerry, I think the rhythm and cadence, the price increases this year won't be dramatically different than they were last year, for example. I think they've been very strong so far. I think you're going to have a geographic mix that's going to give a tailwind to the way pricing is looking.","But I also think that what we said for the last couple of years is entirely true and that is the Western United States on a percentage basis has more price power ahead of it than does the East, simply because the East is the more mature market, prices are higher, so your percentages up won't be as great.","But, again, as North Carolina continues to recover, as Georgia continues to recover, as Florida continues to recover, and as places like Dallas-Fort Worth, as I referenced in my opening comments, have the type of volume growth and pricing growth that they are experiencing. The pricing story we think will continue to be a very good one, not just for a matter of quarters, probably for a matter of years.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And Ward, you've commented in the past that based on the reserve position in Colorado and Dallas markets, where you participate, you would look for aggregates pricing to approach company average pricing over time. Can you just give us an update on where that stands today and how much do you think that gap could narrow in 2017?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, absolutely. If you recall, when we were looking at the transactions in Texas, particularly in North Texas, I want to say at the day and the hour, those prices were about 60% of the corporate average.","As we look at it today, it's about 75% of the corporate average and what we'd spoken of at the time, Jerry, is we thought it would probably take about three years for that to build to something that felt more like a corporate average. I think that's still not a bad place for us to be as we look at it.","The other thing that I would tell you is really it was starting last year that we saw aggregate pricing in Colorado start to move on percentages that were really better than what we're seeing across the corporate average. Now, do I think Colorado is going to be there from a time perspective, at the same time as Texas is? No, I don't. It's going to move a little bit more slowly than Texas. But I still think probably over a five-year period, basically over what we look at as our strategic planning period, Colorado should be closing in on it. Texas very much should be there. Is that responsive, Jerry?","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","You also saw obviously the West Group pricing dynamics, and that's where the Dallas market and the Colorado market would be reported. And I think you can continue to expect those areas \u2013 that area of that country or that segment to report pricing at a higher rate than the balance of the country or the corporate average.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's super helpful. And, lastly, I'm wondering if you could talk about what proportion of your sales were out of your long-haul network within aggregates this quarter compared to last year and how do you expect the full year mix to look like the long-haul versus trucks or markets for you?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You know, what, Jerry, I'd rather not go into specific percentages on that. But I'll tell you, for example, though, is the yards that we have in Florida right now are really some of the best businesses that we have in the East.","So if you think about what's going on in Florida and if you think about what's going on in South Texas, coming out of that new Medina Rock & Rail facility, those businesses to us look better than they did last year. And when we come back and take a look at the full year, my guess is those are probably going to be somewhere in the teens overall from a volume perspective.","Keep in mind, what we move by rail in the United States all by itself, ignoring everything else that's shipped by truck or otherwise, is a top 10 aggregates producer in the United States. So it's a considerable piece of the business. But the areas that we have that business, it's performing exactly as we would have thought, maybe, modestly ahead.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Jerry. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Armstrong with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon and congrats to a good start on the year.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you so much, James.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","My first question, you've talked about weather a little bit and if the weather holds up. What are you seeing in Texas and in the South, in general, following the storms? Did that have any impact on the first quarter at all? And do you think it will impact the second quarter any on a volume basis?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You know what the first quarter was relatively benign and I would tell you not that negatively weather impacted. Now in fairness, April is pretty wet. You saw pretty massive flooding in places like Houston. And does that slow work down for a while? Yeah, it does. And at the same time, you're close enough to the Gulf in areas like Houston that you tend to have areas that can dry out relatively well, particularly if they have a windy circumstance.","So I'll put it this way, James. May is an important month. It always has been. The two months in the aggregates business that tend to be disproportionately important are May and October. May, because it's the first time across the geographic footprint that you have every bit of your business usually really hitting on almost all cylinders and October because that's the last month that, A, is usually dry and a lot of contractors feel like by the time they get to Thanksgiving, in many respects, they'll be packing up their equipment for the year.","So, was April a wet month? Yes, it was. Does May need to be a relatively dry month for the industry? Yes, I would say that it does.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Extremely helpful. Thank you. And then just coming back to ancient history, hopefully at this point, any leftovers from fracing falling off or was that pretty much completely gone at this level and what are you seeing in that market?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. And again, thank you for the question on that. I want to be really clear because really what we sell in the marketplace to the different shale energy players, just to be clear, is not frac material, so we're selling materials to the shale energy players who are building roads or building their pads. So I want to make sure we're clear on that. What we had indicated, we thought, is that we would see relatively maintenance levels of stone going to these different shale plays in the United States.","And what we said is for the year we thought that would probably be in the ZIP code of 2 million tons or about 0.5 million tons a quarter. That's what we viewed as maintenance. So actually as we come back and take a look at exactly where we are in Q1, you know what? It's good to be right and we were right on that. So, it will \u2013 I guess we'll take that, we'll take being right, I'm sorry it's 500,000 tons, but I'd love to see three times that because that's where we were last year.","James H. Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Perfect. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, James.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Hey, good afternoon.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Adam.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Kind of following up on that, the heavy non-res you had some nice growth in the quarter and I think that's a change from previously. Was that due to some of the awards you talked about earlier this year?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","It's not that much of a change for us because a lot of what we're seeing is driven by work that we're seeing, not just in South Texas and that's where a lot of it is, but we are seeing good, nice, non-res and portions of South Carolina. In fact, I called out South Carolina specifically on some infrastructure in our prepared remarks, but we're seeing good non-res in that market. We're also seeing good non-res in Dallas, in Denver, in Orlando, in College Station in Texas as well. So the non-res that we're seeing looks pretty good. I think one data point that's probably worth knowing is six of the Martin Marietta states rank in the top 10 for growth in non-res starts. And two of the states include Florida and Colorado. I think a lot of it, Adam, really comes back to this notion that we discussed I think a lot over the last couple of years, because we were hoping that it would come to fruition the way that it has. Where you are matters. As we're looking at the states in which we have leading positions and keep in mind those leading positions today, one or two, are in 85% versus 65% of our markets five years ago. We've tried to position ourselves in states that have near-term and long-term growth and that tend to have multiple economic drivers in them as well. So again, I don't think the non-res story is dramatically different, but we are seeing some of those very large projects, for example, in South Texas firm up. And we're sticking those backlogs even more capably in our hip pocket right now.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","So are you still seeing projects to bid on, on the heavy side or?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. I mean, what I would tell you is our teams both in Martin Marietta as well as our customer base probably feel as optimistic right now as I've seen people feel in about 10 years. And I think a lot of that's driven by the fact that the eastern United States lagged the west, not by a matter of months, but really by a matter of years, in coming back with some degree of non-res projects in particular.","And keep in mind, a lot of times we said those projects will follow varying degrees of housing recovery with a 9 to 18 month lag, and if we continue to see permits, starts and completions on housing, all in those double digits, and we also continue to see single-family housing ramp up, that's going to be more aggregate intensive and we're going to see the non-res both light and heavy, I think continue to follow that in a very constructive manner.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think, Adam, one of the things that we've seen pretty consistently across the footprint is a lot of distribution activity. Distribution centers and channels like that, I would say uniformly across the footprint. That's been at accelerated level of activity over the past several months or at least reported activity that's on its way down the pipe.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, that makes sense. And just lastly on the, and Ward, I don't know how fair this question is, but can you compare at all the FAST Act to these state-level initiatives? Just trying to get a sense for what's coming in 2017 from the FAST Act versus what we've gotten in 2016 from the state-level initiatives.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","What I would say is this. I don't want to go into 2017 volumes yet as we look at it, but what I would say is you are going to see states continue to let more long-term aggregate-intensive projects over the next several years than they have over the last several years. And I do think the FAST Act will give states who have not been coming out with very specific state initiatives a lot more runway than they've had for a while.","I think the real blessing we're going to have, though, if you really pause and reflect on the key states for us, that we'll have both. I mean think of it in these terms. Colorado is going to have both, separate and distinct from what's going on in Colorado Springs. Iowa has both. Nebraska has both. Texas has both. Remember, the extra funding that comes into Texas just from Prop 7 by the time we get to September 2017 is more money than the increase on a per annum basis than you see even in the FAST Act.","So the FAST Act is nice because it does put dollars there. But the primary component of the FAST Act that's going to be helpful is time. So what's going to happen, you're going to take extra state dollars and combine that with extra time from the fed. It's going to be the confluence of those two factors that will be more profound, particularly beginning in 2017 and then in the out years.","Adam R. Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks so much. See you Monday.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you. See you then.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Betts with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Yes, thank you very much. My two questions, please. You sounded pretty positive on aggregate prices, Ward, but they averaged $13.04 in Q1, but the guidance for the year is only $12.75 to $13.00, so pretty flat. Is there some change going on that you'd expect to offset some of the maybe underlying growth later in the year or am I just being maybe too picky by comparing those numbers? And then secondly, I don't think we talked much about the asphalt business. I mean could you remind me was there a major divestment that impacted that volume number? And secondly, your old firm was commenting yesterday, it's just going to be much more difficult business this year because the escalator clauses were going to kick it, or the adjustment clauses, which would mean that the lower bitumen price would feed through and therefore there would be less pricing power. Does that impact you at all?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, Mike, I would never call you being too picky for asking the questions. That's not a problem. What I would say is this. When you look at Q1, don't ever take Q1 in a vacuum. It's really a good litmus test on exactly what's going on in pricing. Going back to the conversation that we had a few minutes ago, the Midwest is not cranking during Q1. The Mideast is not cranking in Q1. So what you're seeing in Q1 is a lot of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, all of which and the eastern U.S. are pretty high-priced markets.","And then you're obviously seeing pricing in Texas, particularly in North Texas, move at very nice percentages. So what I would tell you is you're going to continue to see good robust pricing but what's going to happen is when Mideast, which is principally Indiana and Ohio, in the Midwest which is principally Iowa and Minnesota and Nebraska, come in, those tend to be more corporate average-y on pricing. So again I think we feel very comfortable with the percentages that we put out there.","To your question on asphalt, here's the way I would think of it. If we look at asphalt, we did about 2.1 million tons of asphalt last year in the Rocky Mountain division. As you really look at it now, that's the only asphalt that we have left. So we did sell frankly a pretty modest asphalt position that we had around the San Antonio marketplace. So the fact that we don't have that business anymore is not going to be a dramatic driver or not on what we're seeing relative to our business.","With respect to liquid asphalt or bitumen and where it is, Mike, my guess is that story is going to change a lot back to what I said before, depending on where you are in the marketplace. Here's the circumstance up and down the front range in Colorado, and when I speak of the front range, I'm really talking about the I-25 corridor. That's where 80% of the people who live in Colorado reside. That market is very, very busy right now on public. It's very, very busy on private res and non-res and in large part you've got a good asphalt market, particularly on the subdivision side, and on the infrastructure side.","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","Okay.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","And a lot of the work in Colorado, particularly a year, a year and a half ago was having to be let a couple sometimes more times, because they weren't having enough bidders who were available. That's going to be a tight market relative to aggregate. It's going to be a tight market relative to contractors who are able to do much of that work. And again, I think it's \u2013 we are looking at our asphalt business that is principally a Colorado asphalt business, we feel pretty good about it. Now, relative to your question on how did it do in the first quarter? It didn't really do much in the first quarter and we don't expect it to do much in the first quarter, again because you are there in the Rocky Mountains. If we're looking at what asphalt sales were for us both internally and externally in the first quarter, it was 134,000 tons versus 147,000 tons in the prior year and the 147,000 tons in the prior-year had the Texas business in it as well.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, no, the 147,000 tons excludes the Texas business, so, Mike, from an asphalt tonnage perspective it was about 123,000 tons in the first quarter of 2015 related to that divested business.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Did that help, Mike?","Mike F. Betts - Jefferies International Ltd.","It does. It helps greatly. Thank you very much.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities. Your line is open.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Hi, Ward, and thanks for taking my questions. Your ready-mixed, 31% increase in volume was outstanding relative to the rest of the industry. Could you maybe give us a little more color on what's going on there and what are the stronger end markets?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","No, Craig, I think the big issue that was going on there is we got rained on all last year. I mean the ready mixed business that really you're looking at when you look at these numbers is what's going on in Texas, and Texas just really never had the ability to show last year what it can do. So again, as you're looking at volume up \u2013 volumes up 31%, the pricing's up 12%, you can see what's happened with gross profit, again, I think this is really more of a story that candidly we're not that surprised by.","We think we've got a very good position in ready mixed both in Texas and in Colorado. I'm particularly pleased to see what we're doing in Texas though relative to the EBITDA, because part of what we'd said before, we would like to see those margins in Texas approach what we see in margins in Colorado.","So if we're looking at EBITDA-ish this year in the Southwest of $38 million, if we are able to do in the southwest on margins what we've been seeing ourselves do in Colorado, that could translate at the right day and the right hour to about $75 million in gross margins, so one, it was a very good story in the first quarter; two, we expect it to be a good story for the rest of the year, but we also expect to see that Texas business continue to do better.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And you've got another easy weather compare coming in Texas. But I guess you're going to have more Colorado in the mix. So stay close to that number in terms of volume growth later in the year?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, we'll have to talk about that when we get together on the next call. I did reference early in my comments that April was wet, and I think you're hearing that from all the players in that marketplace. But again, if you think about where the vast majority of our ready mixed is in Texas, it's in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex that you and a host of others will see next week and I think you'll come away with that with a sense that that's a busy market today and it's going to be a busy market for a while.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then last one, relative \u2013 in the context of this quarter your cement volume increase was modest relative to everything else but your gross margin increase was incredible. So was there something going on there that drove such a large gross margin increase?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","It was seeing volume going through. It was seeing really the plant capacities working in large part in the 80%-ish. We did have some modest change in the way that some of the kiln maintenance worked, but it wasn't dramatic. So really, I'm not surprised with what we saw in cement. I think everything is working there in large part the way that we thought that it would. I think we certainly anticipated that we would expect margin percentages in that business that rivaled what we see in the aggregates business. And so again, you will see Midlothian here when we're together on Tuesday, and I think again you'll get a great sense of what that's going to look like.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay. And the spiky shipments of cement within the quarter that was because of the wholesale sales that you were making?","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","I certainly mentioned the wholesale sales. I just think again the marketplace was healthy. There was some activity that the ready mixed businesses were able to take and run with that they hadn't, and, yes, I did mention the wholesale sales to some other players in the marketplace, but I just think it was the healthier marketplace.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And Craig, I do think there was some not from our perspective, but it's my understanding some of the Texas cement reporting had some \u2013 perhaps some corrections that needed to be made to it that maybe they weren't \u2013 it wasn't counted appropriately.","Craig Bibb - CJS Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. I look forward to seeing you guys on Monday.","Anne H. Lloyd - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","C. Howard Nye - Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Craig. We'll see you then.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Ward Nye for closing remarks.","C.

My name is Crystal, and I'll be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.","Suzanne Osberg","Good morning and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Howard Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, Q3 2019 supplemental information, that summarizes our quarterly results and trends.","As detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Unless otherwise noted, all financial and operating results discussed today are for the third quarter 2019, any comparisons are versus the prior year third quarter, and all margin references are based on revenues. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our Q3 2019 supplemental information and SEC filings. We will begin today's earnings call with Howard Nye, who will discuss our third quarter operating performance as well as market trends as we conclude 2019 and head into 2020. Jim Nickolas will then review our financial results. A question-and-answer session will follow up.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Howard.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. This morning, we released record setting third quarter results. Martin Marietta's disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan together with our commitment to operational excellence provides a foundation for our Company to consistently deliver industry-leading performance. We were able to once again establish new quarterly company records for revenues and profits and year-to-date records for safety. We expect that trend will continue for the remainder of 2019 keeping us on track to announce record full-year results when we report next quarter. In short, Martin Marietta is safer and more profitable than ever.","Driven by widespread improvements in shipments, pricing and profitability across most of our Building Materials business, we delivered outstanding third quarter performance. Consolidated total revenues increased 16% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Consolidated gross profit increased 34% to $421 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA increased 27% to $439 million, and fully diluted earnings per share was $3.96, a 39% improvement.","Supported by the strong performance and encouraging trends, we raised the midpoint of our full-year 2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.275 billion. We've consistently observed that attractive market fundamentals including employment gains, favorable population trends and superior state fiscal health promote sustainable and long-term construction growth. Mindful of these vital attributes, we have purposefully positioned our business geographically and otherwise to be aggregates led in high growth markets. We've also aligned our product offerings to leverage our strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. This proven strategy combined with our pricing discipline underscores our continued ability to capitalize on the robust underlying demand in our key states. That's why we remain confident that increased infrastructure activity from state and local transportation funding initiatives together with continued strength in private sector activity will support steady, sustainable construction growth in our top 10 states, that outpaces the nation as a whole for the foreseeable future.","With that as a backdrop, let's review our third quarter operating results in more detail. Robust product demand and favorable weather led to a 12% increase in aggregates shipments. Notably, all divisions and primary end-use markets contributed to this growth, demonstrating strong underlying demand and our ability to capitalize on it. Aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market increased 7%. As anticipated, shipments for transportation-related projects meaningfully accelerated in our key states of North Carolina, Iowa and Maryland supported by funding provided by the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act and numerous state and local transportation initiatives.","We anticipate public construction, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets to continue to benefiting from the acceleration of state lettings and contract awards in our key states and ongoing federal and state funding. While a successor infrastructure bill has yet to be fully agreed upon by our elected representatives, all indications are that federal transportation funding will continue at a minimum at status quo levels even if the FAST Act expires by its own terms in September 2020 without the immediate passage of multi-year follow-on legislation.","We see little appetite for recurrence of the series of short-term continuing resolutions seen prior to the enactment of the FAST Act in December of 2015. This sentiment is evident and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee's July 2019 draft of a highway authorization bill. This bipartisan effort backed both Republican Chairman, John Barrasso of Wyoming and ranking member Democrat Tom Carper of Delaware, proposes authorizing federal highway funding at $287 billion over the next five years, a 28% increase over the previous authorization's funding levels. Further, the expectation is that the United States House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will propose investment levels even higher than those offered from the Senate.","Accordingly, we believe the necessary confidence and funding securities in place for states to continue to move forward on planned and future construction projects. Furthermore, particularly in the near term, state level funding should continue to grow at a faster rate than federal funding leading to additional infrastructure investment benefiting Martin Marietta. As a reminder, our top 10 states, which accounted for 85% of total building materials revenues in 2018, have all introduced incremental transportation funding measures within the last five years. The infrastructure market represented 38% of our third quarter aggregates shipments, which was below the Company's most recent 10-year annual average of 46%. Since infrastructure is Martin Marietta's most aggregates-intensive end use, the public works growth we're seeing and expecting is encouraging. Aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market increased 19%, with broad-based strength in distribution center, warehouse, data center and wind energy projects in Texas, the Carolinas, Iowa and Maryland. Additionally, we benefited from the reemergence of several large energy sector projects along the Texas Gulf Coast which accounted for nearly 500,000 tons of aggregates shipments during the quarter.","Looking ahead, we believe continued employment and population gains will provide the impetus for sustainable commercial construction activity, particularly in our Southeastern and Southwestern regions. The nonresidential market represented 34% of our third quarter aggregates shipments.","Aggregates shipments to the residential market increased 16%, led by attractive homebuilding activity in Texas, Colorado, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Among other things, homebuilders are now noting improved demand from first-time buyers. We expect continued residential construction growth for both single- and multi-family housing across our geographic footprint, driven by favorable population demographics, job growth, land availability, attractive mortgage rates and efficient permitting. Currently, permit growth, which in our view is the best indicator of future housing construction activity, is outpacing the national average for both multi-family and single-family housing units in our top 10 states. The residential market accounted for 22% of our third quarter aggregates shipments.","To conclude our discussion on end-use markets, the ChemRock\/Rail market accounted for the remaining 6% of aggregates shipments. Volumes increased 4% driven by improved ballast shipments to the Class 1 railroads for continued repair projects from the flooding in the Midwest earlier this year. Based on recent trends and our year-to-date volume growth, we raised our full-year 2019 aggregates shipment guidance from an increase of 8% to 10% to an increase of 11% to 12%. Aggregates pricing improved 5%, reflecting our disciplined pricing strategy and the comparative strength of our markets.","By region, the West Group posted aggregates pricing growth of 9%, which reflects favorable geographic mix and product mix. The Southeast Group achieved pricing growth of nearly 6%, driven by market strength and a higher percentage of long-haul shipments from our higher priced distribution terminals. Our focus on pricing led to a 3.5% improvement for the Mid America Group. Full-year 2019 aggregates pricing is anticipated to increase 4% to 5%. We expect continued pricing momentum in 2020.","Our cement shipments increased 21% to a new quarterly volume record of 1.1 million tons, driven by healthy Texas demand as well as weather-deferred projects from earlier in the year. Cement pricing improved nearly 2% despite unfavorable product mix from a lower percentage of oil well cement shipments. with a robust bidding pipeline, we believe our cement operations will continue to benefit from the tight supply and healthy demand in Texas as well as our recently announced price increase effective April 2020.","Turning to our downstream businesses; ready mixed concrete shipments increased 9% led by double-digit growth in the Southwest Division. Our Rocky Mountain Division experienced project delays which tempered shipment growth. Pricing declined 2% overall as unfavorable product mix and a shift in Texas customer segmentation affected pricing and offset solid pricing gains in Colorado. Our asphalt and paving business, which operates solely in Colorado, benefited from strong customer backlogs and favorable weather conditions resulting in a 34% increase in asphalt shipments. Asphalt pricing, improved 3%.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our third quarter financial results. Jim?","Jim Nickolas","Thank you, Howard. The Building Materials business achieved record quarterly products and services revenues of $1.3 billion, an 18% increase and record product gross profit of $396 million, a 37% increase. Notably, all the Building Materials product lines contributed to this broad-based growth. Aggregates product gross margin increased 480 basis points to 35.1%. This margin expansion was driven by higher prices as well as improved operating leverage from increased shipment and production levels enabled by strong demand and improved weather. The absence of the negative impact from selling acquired inventory burdened by acquisition accounting in 2018 as part of our purchase of Bluegrass Materials was an additional tailwind.","As Howard mentioned, our cement operations benefited from both volume and pricing growth resulting in product revenues of $120 million and gross profit of $49 million, both all-time records. Top line improvement coupled with production efficiencies and lower fuel and maintenance costs led to a 750-basis point expansion of product gross margin to 40.6%.","Magnesia Specialties product revenues decreased 13% to $59 million as chemicals and lime customers reduced inventory levels to align with current demand. However, despite the low revenues, enhanced cost control measures contributed to the 120-basis point improvement in product gross margin to 40.4%. We lowered full-year product revenues and gross profit guidance for the Magnesia Specialties business to reflect current customer activity.","Our business is generating significant cash. Operating cash flow for the nine months ended September 30 increased nearly 50% over the comparable prior-year period. This improvement was driven by growth in earnings and lower contributions to our already well-funded pension plan. We will continue with the balanced and disciplined capital allocation priorities we have long followed to further enhance shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility. Those priorities remain value-enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment, and the opportunistic return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating profile.","Building on my comments about our very strong cash flows, we are pleased to report that less than 18 months after the second largest acquisition in the Company's history, we have de-levered from the Bluegrass Materials transaction and returned, as we said we would, to our target leverage ratio range of 2 times to 2.5 times. For the trailing 12 months ended September 2019, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our applicable credit agreement, was 2.3 times. In addition, we remain appropriately focused on returning cash to our shareholders through a combination of meaningful and sustainable dividends and share repurchases.","Based on our confidence in the outlook for our business and our significant cash generation, our Board of Directors recently approved a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend paid in September, one of the large increases in the Company's history. Our annualized cash dividend rate is now $2.20. Together with our ongoing share repurchase program, we have returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders since February 2015, while at the same time growing our business profitably and responsibly.","Based on recent trends and our strong performance to-date, we have raised our full-year 2019 outlook. As detailed in today's release, we now expect consolidated total revenues in the range of $4.660 billion to $4.770 billion, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.245 billion to $1.305 billion.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Howard.","Howard Nye","Jim, thank you. To conclude, we are proud of the results we posted in the third quarter. And while we're pleased with the numbers, we don't see the performance as surprising. That's because, in nearly every respect, we have thoughtfully developed and consistently executed on our strategic plans, positioning our business as an aggregate\u2019s leader in attractive, high-growth geographies.","We didn't get here by accident. Over the past several years, through our steadfast and proven strategy and stability to the world-class attributes of our business, safety, ethics, cost discipline, and operational excellence. Martin Marietta has positioned itself to outperform. With this in mind, we look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020. Supported by attractive underlying market fundamentals across our geographic footprint, and region-specific third-party forecasts, we believe the current construction cycle will continue for the foreseeable future and expand at a steady pace in 2020. Our outlook is positive across each of our primary construction end-use markets. Our preliminary view anticipates low- to mid-single digit growth in aggregates shipments and mid-single digit growth in aggregates pricing in 2020. Martin Marietta remains committed to the steadfast and proven strategy we developed and executed during our 25 years as a public company. We will drive continued improvement and excellence as we responsibly manage and grow our business to create long-term value for our shareholders.","If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. First, following up on 2020 guidance. Could you flesh out the drivers for the high level of volume and pricing guidance for aggregates? Particularly on the volume side, just to what extent is it dictated by real demand versus just difficulty getting work done because of the tight labor market? And then also any thoughts on cement in Texas would be helpful. In particular, what type of color of energy end-market projects that have been driving the demand now and into 2020? Thank you.","Howard Nye","Sure, Kathryn. Good morning and thank you. As we look at next year, one of the key drivers in our mind, Kathryn, is simply taking a look at where our customer backlogs are at this time of year versus where they were last year. So to give you a good sense of that, if we're looking at Q3 2019 backlog in Mid-Atlantic, our customers, it looks like were up about 57% versus where they were last year in backlog. If we're looking in the Midwest, major project backlog, looks like it's up around 11%. Similarly, if we look in places like the Southwest, and ready mixed backlogs were up 12% driven by market growth in both the North and the South, and then to your point, cement backlog from what we can tell is us up over 65% driven by major project work, and that includes large DOT projects, Kathryn. So as we look at what our customers are telling us, that's giving us the confidence going into the new year, it's the same type of thing we're seeing in Colorado right now, Rocky Mountain customers are saying their backlogs are up around 12%.","So as we look at where the growth is coming, as we indicated we see infrastructure better, we see non-res better, we see residential better next year as well. Specifically, with respect to cement, as I indicated, a lot of it is major project driven. That's very healthy both in North Texas and in Central Texas. As you recall, the two cement plants we have are in Midlothian in North Texas and Hunter in Central Texas. Part of what I think is important in that marketplace too is what we're seeing relative to pricing in 2020. We have put out our pricing letter for next year. We're anticipating an $8 a ton increase in Texas, that's going to be effective April 1. So again, if we look at volume across the aggregates business, we see it being widespread and we see it nice and steady, and we see good customer backlogs. We see the same thing in cement. And again, this is going to be more driven by public works we believe in Texas. And again, we think the pricing environment as we go into 2020, as I indicated in the prepared remarks, both in aggregates and cement looks better going into '20 than it did coming into '19, and it looked better coming into '19 than it did coming into '18.","So a long answer, but I think you need that color on where the volumes coming from and how we see pricing as well.","Kathryn Thompson","Perfect, that's helpful. One follow-up on North Carolina, in particular, we understand that the North Carolina legislature is working on a $600 million transfer to DOT from the general fund to make up for really transitory issues related to storm damage and lawsuits. Our work is showing that this is more a transitory issue and not necessarily impacting revenue generation for new construction. Could you clarify this is accurate and thoughts on the likelihood of closing this gap? Thank you.","Howard Nye","Kathryn, thank you for the question. I can confirm that that's the way that we see it too. The thing to keep in mind, Kathryn, NCDOT has incurred more disaster-related spending in the last three years than in the previous 12 years combined. So if you look at the business that we had last year and the flooding that we had in East and North Carolina, that's Exhibit A to it. The issue is simply this, the theme of reimbursements are taking four years or five years to come in and the legislature understands that.","So to your point, have we seen the North Carolina House already come forward with the $600 million proposed bill? We have. Do we anticipate that the North Carolina Senate will come up with its own formula? We believe that they will, and we think they're going to address that before they leave town. To your point, this is really just approaching something from late this year to early next year, we do view it as transitory. We do believe that the legislature understands this is something that they need to remedy. And we believe that they're committed to remedying it. So, I think your word transitory is indeed the right word.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is open.","Trey Grooms","Thanks for it. So I guess my main question, first question I guess is on ARTBA, you know, some of the contract award data that we've been seeing there has been weakening a bit lately and I think it has created some concern with some folks over the health of the infrastructure market looking into next year, but it sounds like your customer backlogs look very good. You continue to expect public demand to continue to improve in the next year. And I understand this data can be choppy and I think some of your states are lapping tough comps, but can you help us bridge the gap here with what the ARTBA contract award data has been telling us over the last few months and kind of what you're expecting on the public side going forward?","Jim Nickolas","Yes, sure. Trey, thanks for the question. And really, I'm going to try to bridge it for you using some data that pertains directly to bridges, because I think that will help get you there. Look, first of all, when you look at the ARTBA data, I think one thing that you can do is look at it into vacuum because you missed the longer run dynamics of what's happening with marketplace. So to your point, you can see some issues on a month-to-month basis that can cause swings that actually belie the longer-term trends.","So look -- if you look in September of 2018, Colorado had $1.5 billion of awards versus an average of $40 million. So if you've got just a number in a month like that, it can move things around pretty considerably. So I think what you're referring to is when ARTBA came out and said, look, we're looking at trailing 12 months of highways, bridges and tunnels, and at the end of September, they said, it's down 4.5%-ish. What's happening within that is this, if you look at bridges and tunnels and that's back to my note, my observation with you on really bridging this, bridging and tunnels -- bridges and tunnels are down almost 13%, trailing 12 months of highways down 2.1%. But more importantly, if we look at current highway awards, they're 13% above 2017 levels and one of the things that I think it's important to remember is if you're sitting where we sit and that's as part of an aggregates-led company, you're going to be much more focused on what's happening with highways, than you are relative to what's happening with bridges. Equally, if you're coming out of a downturn, and you feel like you may have some safety issues with bridges, you're going to repair those bridges early on and then back off of that and pivot to the highways.","So again, if we're looking at the pivot from bridges to highways, in my view, that's totally accepted, and then more importantly, if you look at what the trend has been, I think you'll actually be very comfortable with the trend, and I would encourage people please don't overreact to just monthly swings because that type of lumpiness can just occur and it's nothing in our view to be alarmed over. The long-term trend is quite positive. And as I indicated, the backlogs that our customers are speaking up on the public side is really very attractive.","Trey Grooms","All right, thanks for that. That is helpful. As from a follow-up, you gave us the backdrop here with your expectation of kind of mid- to high-single digit volume, mid-single digit pricing in aggregates next year. So can you talk about your expectations for cost inflation or maybe any geographic trends that you might be expecting that can impact pricing and margins and maybe how you're thinking about profitability and incremental flow-through in that environment?","Howard Nye","Look, obviously, we will give you a much more granular look-see in 2020 when we come out in February. One note I would make Trey is, on the volume, we're saying, low- to mid-single. I think you misspoke on the percentages that you speaking of in the premise of your question. That's better off. Part of what I would say is, look, do we see any components of our cost structure that we're troubled by? We're not. I mean, we are very focused on costs every day in our business. The single biggest cost drag what we have is labor and we believe we have labor well controlled. So we don't see inflationary actions are occurring there that we think it could be disruptive. Equally, we see energy is really quite well behaved. If you look at the investments that we've made both in plant and in rolling stock over the last several years, we should continue to see nice trends relative to maintenance and repair, and remember, Trey, we have about five areas, labor, maintenance and repair, supplies, DD&A, and energy that are really the drivers of what's going to happen from a cost perspective in our business. So do we see things in that a way that cause us any concern? We do not.","Equally, going back to the commentary that I offered just a few minutes ago, we believe the pricing environment continues to be attractive, and I think it's getting more attractive. One of the metrics that we've long spoken of is that while we tend to be in a position because of an array of factors including the reserves that you just have to take good care of, we tend to get pricing all the way through cycles, we do better after big volume years too, and this is a volume year where we think we're going to be able to come in in 2020 and actually do better on pricing in '20 than we have in '19. So again, our cost profile looks very attractive from our perspective, pricing looks increasingly attractive going into '20. We'll give you a more definitive view of how that's going to translate to EBITDA and gross profit etcetera when we speak again in February.","Trey Grooms","Okay, thank you very much. And just a housekeeping, since you brought up repair and maintenance. Is there anything kind of looking into 4Q that we need to be aware of from a repair and maintenance or stripping costs or timing of anything that can swing around in the 4Q that we should be talking about?","Howard Nye","You know, I think we tried to capture it in the guidance that we've given. One thing that we will be doing, obviously we have sold considerable amount of tonnage this year. And when you're selling tonnage, one of the high-class problems you have from that is you do have more stripping that you need to do and we're going to try to do some of that in Q4 to stay ahead of it and to have us where we need to be as we enter 2020.","Trey Grooms","Got it. Thanks for all the color.","Howard Nye","You're welcome. Thank you, Trey.","Trey Grooms","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your line is open.","Stanley Elliott","Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you all for fitting me in and congrats on nice quarter. Jim, this is more for you, you guys are 2.3 times right now. The commentary from the field that we are hearing is very encouraging into next year, should be another year of good incrementals and another good year of cash flow. What -- how are you all thinking about uses of that cash, especially with opportunities for M&A, it's been fairly quiet year recently, but I would love to get your thoughts on that. What do you want to run at a lower leverage level or if you're more interested in putting it to work? And just kind of how you're conceptually thinking about the capital structure. At this point?","Howard Nye","Well, Stanley, thank you for the question. As you've noted, we've got a high-class worry because this business is delevering exactly the way that we thought it would as we bought Bluegrass. Let me turn that specifically over to Jim to talk through what our capital priorities are because what you'll hear is they haven't changed.","Jim Nickolas","Yes, Stanley, thank you for the question. Our first call on capital is the right acquisition. I want to make sure we've got the dry powder to be in a position to take advantage of strategic and value-enhancing acquisitions. Of course, the next priority for us is investing in our business. Beyond that you'll see -- you'll continue to see a balanced approach. We meaningfully delivered this year as planned. I would expect some further delevering to continue next year but not to the same extent we saw this year. Returning capital to our shareholders beyond that in the form of higher dividend and share repurchases will likely play a larger role in 2020, assuming our leverage remains at the low end of our targeted range 2 times to 2.5 times.","Howard Nye","And Stanley, obviously, as Jim said, the first call on capital is doing the right deals. And I have to brag on our team. I think our team is very good at identifying the transactions. I think they do a superb job going through the contracting piece of it when we really paper the deal and part of what we've been able to do very successfully is synergize deals as well. So again, our priorities have not changed and we're very pleased to be sitting here at this leverage ratio within the relatively short period of time since we closed on Bluegrass.","Stanley Elliott","Absolutely. With the higher volumes, some of the higher repair and maintenance costs, does that mean CapEx will stay elevated in next year or is that something that can kind of be a further contributor to free cash?","Jim Nickolas","Stanley, I think CapEx would be relatively constant as a percent of the size of the business. So I wouldn't view today's elevated. I think it's the right level and next year it will be consistently sized vis-a-vis the business size as well. So you can think about in terms of percent of sales, we wouldn't expect it to change terribly next year.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect, thank you very much for the time. Thanks a lot.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Stanley.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Roger from Exane. Your line is open.","Paul Roger","Hi, good morning guys, congratulations on the strong results. So I just have a question. First off, going back to the cement business. You talked about the demand outlook and what you're going to see it in there. Maybe you could comment a bit more on the margin. Obviously, you had a very strong margin performance in Q3. Was there anything the sort of specific in that time to maintenance costs or something like that? I just don't have any reason why the sort of high 30% to low 40% isn't sustainable going into 2020 for the cement division.","Howard Nye","First of all, good morning, for us and good afternoon to you. So most of your voice, Paul, you know, but there was nothing particularly extraordinary in the quarter. I mean obviously volume was really quite good. If we look at year-to-date pricing, that was up 3.3%. One of the big things that our team is focused on in cement right now is reliability and just making sure that those kilns keep running [Technical Difficulty] Sorry about that. I'm not sure what that was. Are you still with us, Paul?","Paul Roger","Yes, I am. Yes, I can hear you.","Howard Nye","Okay, very good. We had some bad feedback here in the room. So we're focused on making sure we have reliability where it needs to be and we're focused on making sure that we can take care of our customers, and one of our biggest customers in that market happens to be us. So again, I think the cement business is having a very good business -- very good year this year. I think it's going to have a very good year next year. When we bought this business, we anticipated that the cement business that we refer to as strategic cement could have margins that are very similar to the types of margins that we see in our very attractive aggregates business, and I'm pleased to say that's exactly what we're seeing.","Paul Roger","That's good. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the big energy projects you're seeing on the Gulf Coast. Clearly, I think you said they accounted for about 0.5 million tons of shipments in Q3. So at the minute, they're obviously a relatively small driver. Do you expect that to change as these schemes of lump up and sort of how meaningful could this type of work be in the medium term?","Howard Nye","No, you're exactly right. As we look at the quarter, there were nearly 500,000 shipments in Q3 and that's a little bit over a 1 million shipments year-to-date at least through September, at the end of the quarter. Part of what I like looking at, Paul, is it had a nice build throughout the year. So about 240,000 tons in Q1, about 450,000 tons in Q2, we're getting close to 500,000 tons obviously in Q3. We think we're going to continue to see good steady energy work in South Texas for a while. I can tell you, we were down there with the team several weeks ago, these are mammoth projects and these are mammoth projects in wonderfully swampy wet land that's going to take a lot of aggregates to have it into condition that needs to build. To give you a sense of what the scope can be if we're looking at a series of projects that we're working on now, but more importantly if we look at projects into the future, that we should be good candidates for including Driftwood LNG, continued work at Golden Pass, what we think is probably coming at Port Arthur. Those three combined with others would demonstrate to us that there is still about 17 million tons worth of projects along the Gulf Coast, that we should be well positioned to get our share out. So we think that's going to be busy workforce.","The other thing that's going to be worth watching is what happens with high-speed rail in Texas because they're clearly very interested in putting in around the 240-mile lane of dedicated track high speed between Dallas and Houston with the stop ash in College Station. This would be a very large project, it's not going to be 2020 issue, but again, if we look at these large energy projects, they are 2020 issues and beyond 2020. If we look at this type rail -- high-speed rail that could be coming to Texas, those are good attractive long-term projects as well and upward, people say that there could be upwards of 30 million tons of aggregates need on those types of projects. So we feel like non-res in our footprint, it will continue to be really attractive, and we think the Texas market in particular has been good and we think it's going to stay very good.","Paul Roger","That's great, thank you very much. It's nice to participate today.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Ng from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Phil Ng","Hi guys, congrats on a strong quarter.","Howard Nye","Thanks, Phil.","Phil Ng","You're welcome. You're obviously lapping a very tough comp this year just given the strength you've put up on volumes. Could you comment on backlogs sound quite good for next year. Could there be some upside on your low- to mid-single digit volume outlook for 2020? And if you had to rank the level of confidence between the three different end markets you're exposed to, how do you think about it for 2020?","Howard Nye","So you slide that well trying to get me talk more about 2020. We will give you some really good color on that when we get into February. If I'm thinking about the three, obviously, the commentary said that we think, well, of all three of them going into 2020, which is true. And I think what we will continue to see though is that good, steady build in infrastructure. So if you go back to the commentary that we offered in the prepared remarks, we spoke about the percentage of infrastructure in our business today and what a 10-year average looks like. I'm not suggesting it's going to both back up to 10-year averages, I'm suggesting it's going to be a nice slow, steady climb back to some numbers that have a consistent form in front of them. We think that makes good sense.","If we look at the year and really think about where non-res has been, non-res has been somewhere in the mid-30s this year. I mean those are at least on a historical perspective pretty high percentages. At the same time, we go back to the conversation I was having with Paul just a minute ago and you think about what some of those non-res projects can be, it's pretty big tonnage. And the other thing that I think, so that's making the world difference for us, particularly non-res since one reason we have such confidence in that going into the new year, is the way we have built our businesses around corridors.","So if we're in Colorado, we're talking about I-25. If we're in Texas, we're talking about I-35. If we're in the Southeast, we're talking about I-85. And these are major commerce corridors and we think will continue to see good residential activity and those markets and we think will continue to see good non-res activity in those markets. I'll tell you, it was comforting to look at best year-on-year increases in homebuilding in student markets like Orlando, where we have a presence, in Charlotte, where we have a presence, and in Houston, where we have a presence.","So that's my way of saying, looking at the end users, they all look reasonably healthy to me, they do not look in any respect overbuilt to me. And if there is one place that I would tell you to watch in particular, that's one that works because we think that's going to continue to expand.","Phil Ng","That's great color. What I mean if there was any pocket that should be a little more cautious on would be non-res, and it sounds like you are quite bullish on that backdrop. And I guess for 2020, I think implicit in your full-year guidance for aggregates volumes implies 4Q volumes would track closer to low-single digit growth. Did you see any pull forward in 3Q or anything notable that could be a drag on the fourth quarter?","Howard Nye","Let me turn that to Jim. We did see some modest, but the other thing that we're doing, just before I turn it over to Jim is, we said coming into the year, we thought it'd be a wetter than usual year, we're betting on a normal to early winter as well. So with that backdrop, let me turn it to Jim.","Jim Nickolas","Yes, I think we've got anecdotal evidence that while the customers are trying to rush to beat winter and so particularly in our more northern districts and divisions. So we do have some anecdotal views evidence that that's happening, they pulled some work into Q3 from Q4.","Phil Ng","Okay, but there is nothing outside of that, that would kind of bog you down in the fourth quarter because your comps, I think was not terrible, but it's probably fair to kind of bake in some conservatism because your shorter months are always tough to predict. Is that a good way to think about it?","Howard Nye","If you think about it, the two businesses, in particular in the third quarter, that really did 1% aggregates volumes were the Mideast in the Midwest. So we're talking in those contexts, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, and Nebraska and those are all parts of the country that can seasonally be much more impacted by an early winter. So we're just mindful of what that could be.","Phil Ng","Okay, thanks for the color. Really appreciate it.","Howard Nye","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adrian Huerta from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Adrian Huerta","Thank you and congrats on the results. My question was somewhat related to the previous one. So you kind of answered that one. So, my other question was just on cash taxes. If you're still expecting cash taxes to be somewhere around $90 million for the year and where they were so far in the first nine months of the year? Thank you, Howard.","Howard Nye","You bet. I'll turn to Jim over the cash taxes. He has got a tax background about that.","Jim Nickolas","Yes, I think you're pretty close to spot on, Adrian. So I think that's the right number, low to mid-90s for 2019.","Adrian Huerta","Perfect.","Jim Nickolas","The second question -- I couldn't remember\u2026","Adrian Huerta","No, that was -- that was basically the first one was also on potentially conservative guidance in 4Q. But given what you have just said that they were probably projects that that were advanced into 3Q and that's what is going for the conservative fourth quarter. So, thank you.","Jim Nickolas","You're welcome.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Adrian.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute. And we will move on to our next question from Michael Wood from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Michael Wood","Hi, good morning. First, I just wanted to ask about our cement and asphalt prices being down sequentially if you could give us more color on that?","Howard Nye","Well, actually, what I would say is, cement pricing was really, it was down sequentially only because of mix issues because we actually sold less into West Texas in oil well this quarter than we did previously, and one thing that I would call out and this is something, Michael, that I'm really happy to see, pricing actually did quite well in the South, meaning that the central part of Texas for us if we look over that period of time that we've owned these assets, Midlothian pricing has always frankly outperformed Hunter, and again, I feel very good about what we see in North Texas. What I liked in this particular quarter is I'm seeing good solid performance in the South as well. So I think that's notable. With respect to -- were you talking about hot mix or were you talking about ready mix pricing? I want to make sure I'm addressing your next question appropriately, Michael.","Michael Wood","I was talking about ready mix.","Howard Nye","Okay. I thought so. You said -- I think you've said hot mix, but I thought you meant ready mix. Here's the deal on ready mix and it's easy to sort out, our volume was nicely up for the quarter, our volume is up for the quarter 12% in the Southwest and it was up about 1.5% in the Rocky Mountains, and here's what that means. You've got a fairly notable geographic mix difference between the Southwest ready mix and the Rocky Mountain ready mix and by that, I mean about $30 per cubic yard difference and Rocky Mountain ready mix is simply a higher priced product. So when we're selling more ready mix in Texas as we were in this instance, the geographic mix that we've experienced will just give you frankly optically a lower ASP, that's the primary driver of what you're seeing.","There was a modest mix relative to where we were selling as well. If you go back to the beginning of the year, Michael, you'll recall that we've said we were going to plan for a wetter than usual year and part of what our team looked at is if we're going to plan for a wetter than usual year, what are the different end uses particularly in ready mix that we can be more aligned with, that are not as sensitive to rain? And frankly, homebuilding is one of those. So we ended up pushing modestly more ready mix to homebuilding in Texas and that tends to have a little bit lower ASP as well. So if we look at what's going on, was it driven by the fact that there was simply more ready mix in Texas than there was in Colorado? Yes. Was it driven by the fact that we pivoted modestly to having more residential? Yes. But here's the important thing, at the end of the day, Michael, we made more money, and that's really what all those moves were about for us. So I wanted to give you the underlying specifics on what was happening with ASP. But I also wanted to say, at the end of the day, this is about creating higher returns for shareholders and stakeholders and that's what we did.","Michael Wood","Great, that's helpful. And then on the Magnesia Specialties business, is the inventory destock ended? Is that a multi-quarter destock? If you can give us more color on that. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Yes, I think it is. It's winding its way down. I think we anticipate that will continue in full up and that's in large part what we tried to do with the take-down in the guidance. So it's not an issue that we have long-term concerns about. As you will see, the team in Magnesia, really when they saw a modest slowdown, adjusted their cost profile very, very quickly. So to see that type of movement and actually see margins go up in that business is really a wonderful sign. So I would encourage you if you have running lights on anything, certainly don't have them on Magnesia Specialties, that business is sitting in a good place, it just has to work through some of the inventory issues that we do not see as long term at all.","Michael Wood","Great, thank you.","Howard Nye","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes, hi, good morning. I'm wondering if you could talk about how pricing cadence played out over the course of the quarter. I think we typically see you folks later on price increases over the course of the third quarter. Is that how it played out this year? Or was it more front-end loaded? Any color that you can share with us on the cadence would be helpful.","Howard Nye","No, sure Jerry, you know, what -- they're really, as we've talked over the course of the year, they're willing enough, then that'd be mid-year price increases. So, I think much of it was just driven by more volume and where some of the volume is coming from and the normal price increases that we would have. Now clearly, I'm not encouraging you to go and bake in a consistent 9% increase in the West. If you could, I mean that was the very impressive pricing performance in those driven by a couple of things. One, we do have good pricing in Colorado, and as we've discussed over the last several years, that's a marketplace that as we look at our overall footprint tends to have lower aggregates pricing and we think we should get good value for that product than we are. If we look at what's happening in the Southwest, we did move more stone by rail and moving them into higher priced sales yards and what I would say is, I think that's actually a good sign. I think it's a good sign for a number of reasons. One, that tells you the Central Texas is getting healthier, number one, but you see other thing that it says that the railroads are performing better too.","I mean, one thing that I think is notably different this year versus last is we would have had a series of conversations last year around rail performance and how that was looking and you have not heard that this year and as we look at the year, we're probably going to send something in the range of mid-30 million tons by rail in the United States this year and I think that's probably 2x our next closest competitor. So, that clearly helped on the pricing side of it as well. And we did see some reasonable yard activity in Florida. So I would tell you those were the primary issues that I would call out for you with respect to pricing, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Okay, I appreciate the color. And then any mix difference versus normal seasonality? So if we look at over the past 10 years, your heritage pricing is typically up $0.20 sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter. So if that dynamic plays out this year, your pricing cadence exiting the year will be up 6%, just the way the math works out. Is that something that you expect to play out under normal seasonality? Or are there any moving pieces from, I think that we should keep in mind?","Howard Nye","I guess what I would say, is this, if you're trying to just look at Q3 ASP and you're trying to sort through what all the mix issues, are instead of being modestly over five, it probably would have been modestly over four, that's probably just a pure straight up same on same type comparison Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then in terms of the 2020 pricing conversations, we're hearing from a couple of your competitors that those discussions for some are happening earlier in the season, where considering as you pointed out earlier on the call how strong volume growth has been this year. So within the mid-single digit range obviously that you spoke about for '20, that could be a really wide range. It does sound like pricing is accelerating into '20 and I'm just wondering if you can comment on what have been the magnitude of price increases that you've announced so far and obviously, we'll see what they'll stick, but it sounds like the price ask is higher in '20 than what it's been over the past couple of years in terms of percent increase.","Howard Nye","No. Jerry, I think that's probably right. The only one that I'm really willing to talk to in specific dollar terms is what I've spoken to relative to cement at the $8. Obviously, the aggregates can move pretty considerably depending on where you are and what the product mix is going to be. So again, we'll give you more specifics on that as we come into the new year, but if your premise is more people are having more conversations earlier and the numbers sound generally higher, I would agree with all of those basic premises.","Jerry Revich","Okay, thank you. And Howard, lastly, maybe we can talk about cement pricing, specifically you folks have done much better than the market over the past couple of years. But for the market as a whole, it's been really disappointing pricing actions, I'd say for the past really two-plus years. Are you more optimistic that the market will be more disciplined in cement overall heading into next year? And any data points that drive the confidence around the price increase that you had mentioned you had announced in cement?","Howard Nye","Well, I again -- I think when I go back and refer you back to the backlog numbers that I gave you before on where cement sits today versus where it sat last year, I think that certainly gives us confidence around it. If we look at the sheer quantum of infrastructure work in Texas, that gives us confidence around it as well. And the other thing to keep in mind is we're not a nationwide cement player, we're Texas cement player and we're the largest producer of cement in a market that will likely have more need for cement than it can produce in Texas. And we think that's a fine recipe for success in that state.","Jerry Revich","Okay, I appreciate the discussion. Thank you.","Howard Nye","You bet. Take care, Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute.","Garik Shmois","Can you hear me? I'm sorry.","Howard Nye","Garik, we hear you now. Yes.","Garik Shmois","Okay, I'm sorry about that. So I was wondering on nonresidential looking out to 2020, you talked about energy projects being potential source of acceleration, but you saw really good growth this year in data warehouses and I'm understanding that you've set up your asset footprint along some of these high-growth non-res corridors. So I was wondering if you could speak to that end market in particular into next year and maybe a little bit more broadly, if you're expecting any change in the non-res composition of growth into 2020 by end market?","Howard Nye","Garik, thanks for the question. I think it can move around a little bit and I think it can vary. We've seen all through attractive wind farm activity this year in Iowa. I think we might start seeing more of that type of activity farther south next year. I think what we continue to see warehousing will be very, very healthy, and I think the warehouse and in particular is what's going to drive a good number of our volumes in those markets, Garik. I mean what you've seen relative to warehousing in places like Indianapolis and even in areas such as the [indiscernible] has been really pretty impactful to our business and we think it will continue to be, it goes back to the observation you made at the premise of your question, and that is if you build your business along these high corridors, you're going to see good non-res growth, and again, Garik, we think that's going to be very healthy in 2020.","Garik Shmois","Okay, thanks. And then just lastly on the outlook. It's tough to handicap. But if you think about infrastructure, we get that a lot of the visibility that you have is based on the awards that have occurred really over the last several years, but we're getting some more questions just on recession threat and what would happen if there is not a timely extension or passage of a new highway bill. So is there any contemplation about any potential disruptions on the federal side and how that might impact infrastructure demand etcetera?","Howard Nye","I will tell you; I hear very little to nothing about a recession threat from the federal side at all. I don't see it. And I think the other thing that everyone that I speak to in Washington, not only representatives of people to trade associations come away with the view that the notion of short-term CRs is not a place that anyone wants to be, and everyone understands that this is a much needed area of consistent investment. So we're not seeing things in our dialogs, and we stay very close to us -- very close to it. That gives us a sense of that's going to end up being an issue next year, Garik.","Garik Shmois","Great, thanks so much.","Howard Nye","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Timna Tanners","Hey, good morning, guys and thanks Howard for all that great color. And only things I had left that I was hoping for a little bit more detail on was since you mentioned that M&A is your top priority for use of cash, if you could characterize the environment and the opportunities that you might have this?","Howard Nye","Timna, thanks for the question. It is always a very active dialog. I mean, the question is how far is to go beyond the dialog and what does the acquisition look like in a relative state because different acquisitions are going to have different levels of attractiveness to us. What I will tell you is the dialog that is underway with businesses directly and in some instances the dialog is underway with people who are representing businesses tends to be a very active dialog and where that leads, I can't predict right now, but it has continued to be a very consistent positive thoughtful dialog and part of what I like Timna is, as Jim indicated, through our deleveraging, we're in a very good place today and I think from the perspective of, what we believe we can do from a regulatory perspective, we're in a very attractive place as well, and we like to think that's from a competitive viewpoint something that actually works in our favor.","Timna Tanners","Okay, super. And then the only other question I had was on SG&A, you raised the guidance. Just wondering if you could just give us some color on that to help us think about the future.","Jim Nickolas","Yes, hey, Timna, it's Jim. That's predominantly personnel expense, made up of a few things, like going labor inflation standard, some incentive compensation given the outperformance of the business and a few IT initiatives as well.","Timna Tanners","Okay, super. Thanks again.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Timna.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Rohit Seth","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just on the infrastructure, you said the volumes dropped 7% [ph] in non-transportation projects and reconstruction in the Midwest. Just tell us where you're seeing the strength in the transportation side? And then if you can talk about, what's actually happening in the Midwest with the reconstruction efforts?","Howard Nye","Rohit, I think part of what you run into the Midwest is every year when they go through bad freestyle [ph], you still have more roads in the Midwest that tend to be far-to-market type roads, that tend to be gravel roads, and so what you'll see after winter is a fairly significant need to repair those roads. What's happened this year is you had the freestyle, you had winter, you had repair needs, and then you actually had repair needs that were so acute also driven by the flooding that it tended to go much more deeply into the year than it typically does. So what I would say is, you've got traditional paving projects in that part of the world that you would expect to see year-in and year-out. And then we've seen considerably more just raw maintenance activity in that part of the United States because of some of the flooding situations that we saw last year, and by the way, that plays into part of what we've seen in the ChemRock\/Rail piece of the business as well.","I mean if you look at that, you will also see that I talked about the fact that ChemRock\/Rail shipments were up 4% for the quarter and that was really led by ballast shipments, I didn't say it in my prepared comments, but the fact is, it's really into the Western United States and that ties very directly back into that part of the country that you're asking about right now.","Rohit Seth","Okay. And then on the transportation projects, what states we're seeing strength?","Howard Nye","The fact is, we're seeing strength in almost all of our top 10 states. And if you go back to it and you think about what we discussed relative to those state DOT budgets and what they have done with their spending or investment levels over the last several years, it's been pretty considerable. I mean. Texas is 37% of our revenue. And if we look at what their project awards have looked like and where Prop [ph] 7 is kicking in and Prop [ph] 1, and these are big numbers and then the other thing that we're seeing there is the return of a very significant design build projects. Colorado, as I indicated before, has had very active bidding activity in that state. We're actually seeing a proposition. It's called Proposition CC in that state, it could actually raise more than $10 billion for transportation over the next 15 years. Georgia DOT has lettings at $2 billion, which is 2x where it was in 2014. So these are all the types of initiatives that we've seen in our top 10 states that I think has these states outperforming the nation as a whole right now, and probably for the foreseeable future.","Rohit Seth","Okay. And then, just building on that ARTBA question earlier. Does it surprise you that the project flow has been more -- has been very lumpy and perhaps there's been less large projects coming to the market than we've seen in the past?","Howard Nye","No, it doesn't. Because I think if you look at the nature of some of these jobs, you're going to have that degree of lumpiness and one of the things that I think is important is, as I indicated in response to the earlier question, what does the trend look like on a multiyear basis? And the other thing is, if you talk to the people at ARTBA, they too would tell you we're not surprised by this. This is the type of activity that we would expect and it's the type of longer term dynamics that we're looking for that we actually think are helpful on as well.","Rohit Seth","Got you. So you have the view that maybe 2020 the ARTBA awards probably move back in a positive direction?","Howard Nye","Well, again, if I'm looking at where awards are, and I'm looking at about where they are from 2017 levels and I'm thinking about the business over multiple years, again, they're 13% above 2017 levels. I mean, I think if you go back and charted Seth, what you'll find is something that's not going to be [indiscernible] to you, again, I think breaking down what's highways and what's bridges and then sorting out aggregates intensity is an important part of that conversation.","Rohit Seth","All right. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please check that your line is not on mute. Thank you. And we will move on to our next question from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your line is open.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Howard Nye","And we hear you.","Adam Thalhimer","Great. I wanted to ask first and sorry if I missed this, I hopped on late, but the Southeast Group with volumes up 1%, what would that have been ex the hurricane. And then just some high-level thoughts on just core demand in the Southeast.","Howard Nye","Yes, really the Southeast had a relatively tough comp, that's your bigger issue there. I would not put too much stock into what happened this quarter with Dorian in the Southeast or Imelda, I mean Dorian interrupted a few days. It obviously shut down production in the Bahamas, and we've been working with our team there to make sure their lives are in order, and oddly enough Dorian the same storm that knocked around the Bahamas actually found its way before it was done up to Nova Scotia as well. But -- and I would look at the Southeast and say that was really more driven by a tough comp than anything else going on. I wouldn't describe significant Dorian effect to that.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. And then, on high level on private construction Howard, does it feel like private is still good everywhere or do you think it's -- are we at a point where some geographies are really, really good and some geographies have started to slow?","Howard Nye","Yes, I guess I'm going back to my earlier commentary, I don't see places that are overbuilt and I think that's a really important place to start. I think the other thing that I would point you to is if you're looking at the Dodge Momentum Index or the ABI, I mean part of what you'll see is for example in the ABI, the South and the South in the ABI is a big swath of territory, that's going from the Atlantic Coast to Texas. So you think about the ABI's South region, that's going to be a big piece of our business, it has consistently been a leader in the way the ABI has looked at. It's also been a leader in the way we looked at it through the DMI. So I think your point is a good one Adam and that is not all markets are created equal and some markets are better than others. And part of what we have tried to do and we outlined it in the prepared remarks is put ourselves very intentionally in markets that we feel like in every cycle will outperform and I think that's what we've done and I think that's what we're seeing in the volume numbers. And I think that's one reason that we have such confidence in non-res and [indiscernible] population trends are moving in those directions; we see big projects coming and we see steady medium projects ahead of us as well.","Adam Thalhimer","Great.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Ward Nye, President and CEO. Please go ahead.","Ward Nye","Good afternoon and thank you for joining Martin Marietta Materials\u2019 quarterly earnings call. With me is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019re grateful for your time today and the opportunity to share our first quarter 2012 results.","As an initial matter, let me remind you that this discussion may include forward-looking statements in connection with future events or future operating or future financial performance. Forward-looking statements in this discussion are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.","Except to the extent required by applicable law, Martin Marietta undertakes no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise. Martin Marietta refers you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our first quarter 2012 results and to Martin Marietta\u2019s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be found on the SEC\u2019s website.","Our first quarter results reflect positive trends in both our aggregates and magnesia specialties businesses, leading us to increase our full-year guidance. Our aggregates business achieved volume and pricing improvements that resulted in expansion of heritage aggregates business gross margin by 250 basis points excluding freight and delivery revenues. Volume growth in each of our end-use markets led to a 9.6% increase in heritage aggregates product line shipments over the prior-year quarter.","As expected, our pricing momentum continued and it exceeded our forecast, achieving a 2.8% improvement in average selling price for our heritage aggregates product line over the prior-year quarter.","We\u2019re also pleased with first quarter results in our recently acquired operations in the Denver, Colorado area, which benefited from heightened construction activity in the Denver market.","Additionally, our Specialty Products business continues to perform well and has again established new records for both quarterly net sales and first quarter earnings from operations.","Consolidated first quarter results were predictably hampered by the seasonality of our new Rocky Mountain division. This division\u2019s better than expected performance was achieved despite almost 55 inches of Denver area snowfall this past winter. Whereas the operations along the Mississippi River that we exchanged last December are less susceptible to winter weather, the acquired Denver operations will tend to have weaker first quarter results and realize stronger earnings and cash flows later in the year. For the full year 2012, we expect this River for Rocky Mountain asset exchange to be neutral to our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. Importantly, we expect this acquisition to be accretive in 2013.","Our quarterly earnings also reflect expenses related to our proposed business combination with Vulcan Materials Company. Excluding the $0.34 per diluted share effect of these expenses and the $0.17 loss per diluted share of the newly acquired operations, our adjusted loss per diluted share improved 23% to $0.30 versus the first quarter of 2011\u2019s loss per diluted share of $0.39.","Our heritage aggregates product line volume growth reflects improvement in each of our reportable groups, led by a nearly 12% increase in our West Group. While our aggregates business benefited from mild winter weather in most heritage operating regions, we also saw indications of economic growth bolstering demand. As an example, our Midwest division, which primarily serves Iowa and Nebraska, reported a 34% increase in heritage aggregates product line volumes. Mild weather contributed to a nearly 100% increase in this market\u2019s agricultural lime shipments over the prior-year quarter. Similarly, as counties and municipalities accumulated unspent snow removal funds, this money sometimes is used for roads resurfacing projects, reflecting construction activity that should be incremental for the full year. This division also experienced heightened non-residential shipments, a usually reliable sign of economic growth.","As I mentioned, earlier each of our heritage end-use markets grew. The heritage non-residential end-use market led with a 17% increase in aggregates product line shipments over the prior-year quarter. This growth reflected increased shipments for repair and maintenance projects as well as energy sector activity.","Heritage aggregate shipments for our residential end-use market increased 8% over the prior-year quarter, led by single-family housing activity. Growth was noteworthy in the San Antonio, Texas area, partially attributable to military base realignment and closure activity. San Antonio data also reveals that multi-family housing is currently at a 93% occupancy rate. There are also encouraging signs in markets such as Charlotte, North Carolina, where a customer who has not bid on any subdivision work in three years now has the opportunity to bid on at least five new projects.","Our heritage infrastructure end-use market increased 7% over the prior-year quarter. We are very encouraged by this growth, as this market remains constrained by uncertainties surrounding long-term federal highway funding. Recently, Congress again extended federal funding through June 30. This is the ninth short-term continuing resolution since the long-term federal transportation bill expired in September 2009. During this interim period, states have been pressed to further supplement the funding of infrastructure investment. To that end, we were gratified when the State of Texas announced plans to leverage an additional $2 billion to fund high-priority projects for the next two years.","Additionally, in North Carolina, the Garden Park toll road near Charlotte is expected to be bid later this year. Also, the State of North Carolina recently received permission to collect tolls on Interstate 95 as a funding mechanism for plans to overhaul the state\u2019s entire 182 miles of this highway. Our significant presence throughout Texas and North Carolina makes us well positioned to serve these aggregates intensive projects in both the near and longer term.","In concluding our comments on heritage end-use markets, ChemRock and rail shipments increased 4% over the prior-year quarter.","Heritage aggregates pricing improvement was lead by a nearly 8% improvement in our West Group. In addition to pricing increases implemented during 2011, first quarter pricing benefited by increased sales from distribution yards in South Texas. As you may recall, we developed a new rail located sales yard in South Texas, principally designed to serve Eagle Ford Shale activity.","Our Southeast Group reported a pricing increase of 2%, whereas our Mideast average selling price declined nearly 2%. Pricing in our Mideast Group is typically more sensitive to job type. And for the quarter this fluctuation was driven by product mix as we served a certain project with lower priced sand.","As expected, the increase in our overall aggregates product line average selling price was less than the increase in our heritage locations. This is due to our newly acquired Denver-based business, which as a reminder is a truck-served market with lower overall average selling prices. Additionally for the quarter, these locations had a higher percentage of sales attributable to base stone versus clean stone when compared with our heritage aggregates business.","During the quarter, in response to increased shipments, heritage product line production rose by more than 8%. Although we gain efficiencies with higher production levels, certain direct production costs, including supplies and repairs, are typically negatively affected by unplanned increases early in the year.","We also continued to experience higher energy costs in the quarter, led by increased diesel fuel expense. For the quarter, we paid an average of $3.24 per gallon for diesel fuel, 15% more than the prior-year quarter. Overall, energy expenses increased 18% over the prior-year quarter. Despite these cost headwinds, we reduced heritage aggregates production cost per ton slightly compared with the prior-year quarter. On a consolidated basis, cost of sales increased proportionally to the increase in net sales.","We continue to focus on controlling our selling, general, and administrative, or SG&A expenses. We reduced these cost by 50 basis points as a percentage of net sales even after adding nearly 500 employees with our three acquisitions completed in 2011. We achieved this result by implementing certain organizational changes in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. This reorganization included the early retirement of several senior executives as well as the realignment of our operating divisions and personnel to better match current business levels. While on an absolute basis SG&A expenses increased $4.4 million, primarily related to our acquisitions, as a percentage of net sales, we believe our SG&A is industry leading.","Our operating performance continues to benefit greatly from our Specialty Products segment, which again set new records for both quarterly net sales and first quarter earnings from operations. Net sales of $51.7 million show a 5% increase over the prior-year quarter, reflecting growth in both dolomitic lime and chemicals product lines. Increased sales along with effective cost management resulted in a 440 basis point improvement in the business operating margin over the prior-year quarter excluding freight and delivery revenues.","Earnings from operations for the quarter were $18.2 million. To demonstrate the long-term growth of this business, earnings from operations are nearly three times the level achieved in the first quarter of 2009.","We continue to invest in the new lime kiln being constructed at our Specialty Products Woodville, Ohio facility. We expect this project to be substantially completed by the end of the year and thereafter generate annual net sales ranging from $22 million to $25 million, with margins comparable to current levels.","While focusing on operating our business, we also continue to pursue a business combination with Vulcan Materials. Accordingly, several related developments are ongoing. First, we\u2019re working with the Department of Justice on its regulatory review and to narrow the issues remaining to be discussed. To date, we\u2019re pleased with the progress in this aspect of the proposed transaction and are optimistic that we will resolve the outstanding issues around mid-May.","Additionally, we\u2019ve completed a bench trial in the Delaware Chancery Court related to certain aspects of the exchange offer and are awaiting the Chancellor\u2019s ruling. We\u2019re also proceeding with our nomination of four independent directors to the Vulcan Board at its Annual Meeting scheduled for June 1.","We believe Vulcan shareholders deserve committed directors that act in their best interest, viewing our offer through an independent lens. As expected, our multiple efforts have financial ramifications. And for the quarter, we incurred $26 million in business development expenses. We continue to believe the combination of our company with Vulcan provides a compelling opportunity to enhance value for shareholders of both companies and are steadfastly committed to making this transaction a reality.","During the quarter, we used $4 million for operating activities compared with $21 million provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2011. As expected, the Denver-based operations were a significant factor, as we used approximately $22 million for operating activities at these newly acquired locations. Operating cash flow for the year also reflects the impact of business development costs. Our days sales outstanding was 45 days, unchanged from 2011.","We invested $38 million in organic growth capital during the quarter and maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share.","At March 31, 2012, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.53 times, in compliance with the limits under our amended debt covenant.","We are increasingly optimistic for the rest of the year. And based on first quarter trends, we revised our heritage aggregates product line volume guidance. We now expect infrastructure end-use market volume to range from flat to down slightly. We anticipate double-digit growth in non-residential shipments, driven by increased energy sector demand.","Residential shipments are expected to increase at a higher rate compared with the level of improvement in 2011. Finally, we expect ChemRock and rail volume to be consistent with 2011. Overall, we now expect heritage aggregates product line volume to increase from 4% to 5%. We also expect overall heritage aggregates product line pricing to increase from 2% to 4%. A variety of factors beyond our direct control may exert pressure on our volumes, and our pricing increase is not expected to be uniform across our company.","Politically, we are encouraged that the President continues to advocate rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure. We\u2019re also pleased to continue to see bipartisan Congressional agreement that infrastructure is an essential government priority. Still, since this is an election year, our expectation is that the current federal highway program will be extended only by more continuing resolutions until the end of the year.","Our heritage aggregates direct production cost per ton is expected to decline slightly, with increased production generating operating efficiencies. This expectation assumes that production efficiencies will offset increases in energy prices.","SG&A expenses exclusive of the incremental expense at our new Denver operations are expected to decline slightly. We expect improvement in SG&A expenses related to the Denver operations as we continue to integrate them into our disciplined cost structure.","Earnings for our Specialty Product segment are now expected to range from $68 million to $70 million. We expect interest expense to remain flat this year. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22%, and capital expenditures are forecast at $155 million. This estimate includes the remaining capital for the new kiln at our Specialty Products business.","As a reminder, our expectations for 2012 assume Martin Marietta Materials on a standalone basis and do not consider any effects that would flow from the proposed combination of Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials.","This is an exciting time for Martin Marietta and we remain focused on operating our business and delivering results that enhance long-term shareholder value.","Thank you for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. At the end of today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll offer some additional closing comments. However, if the operator will now give the required instructions, we\u2019d be happy to address your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities. Please go ahead.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Good afternoon, Ward. Good afternoon, Anne. What gives you the confidence to raise your volume expectation for the year? What are the factors you\u2019re focused on?","Ward Nye","Arnie, if we go back and take a look at the different buckets where the volumes are coming from, we\u2019ve seen even up in infrastructure in the first quarter. I know that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing for the full year across the entire business or the entire country. But if you look at where Texas is and what their DOT spending is likely to be, if you look at where North Carolina is, if you look at a state like Iowa that has the largest DOT program in its state\u2019s history this year, those are all important states for us.","I think more importantly though is we come back and look at some of the other buckets. If we look at non-res, clearly the activity we\u2019ve seen in energy last year coming into this year continues to be good. But I think what really gives us some confidence is we\u2019re seeing movement beyond just energy in non-res. We\u2019re seeing new data centers. We\u2019re seeing distribution centers being built.","And then even as we go into the residential market, what we\u2019re seeing with respect to housing is a pretty good story. We talked a little bit about what we were seeing in San Antonio in the prepared remarks, but we\u2019re seeing good single-family activity in a number of markets across our business. We also continue to see a lot of multi-family activity as well. We\u2019re seeing that in places like Wilmington, North Carolina. The coastal areas of the Carolinas have been pretty hard hit the last couple of years.","And when we\u2019re seeing new apartment complexes going up, that\u2019s giving us a lot of confidence. And then finally, even what we have in ChemRock and Rail where callings were to be relatively flat for the year, clearly what we\u2019ve seen in Ag lime in the first part of the year tells us there continues to be pent up demand in that sector. So, Arnie, as I picked and marched through those buckets, that\u2019s a quick snapshot that I\u2019m seeing, and I think that does give us confidence that the volume growth is going to be there.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","That\u2019s very thorough and thank you. And just as a follow-up, the 250 basis points improvement you had in margin, can you go through some of the factors that are in your view of the sustainability of the margin improvement?","Ward Nye","Clearly this is something we\u2019ve been doing for a while, so we are not newbies to taking out cost and we continue to look at it. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve done with the costs in this quarter, particularly given the fact that we\u2019ve been doing this for a while now. I\u2019ll tell you what really gave me some even greater appreciation of what our operating teams did.","We actually moved considerably more material by rail this quarter than we have in previous Q1s. My last number in my mind tells me that we moved around 38% more material by rail this quarter going from operating locations to new yards or other yards than we did in the prior quarter. If we take a look at that, it would even put more even behind the 260 basis points. So as we look at what we came in with and what it really would have been more on a same-on-same, we\u2019re pretty encouraged by that.","The other thing I\u2019ll remind you too, Arnie, is we all get excited when we talk about volumes being up 9.6%. That sounds like a great number, but that\u2019s still 23.8 million tons. When I go back and compare that to history, that\u2019s a little bit less than we did in 2009 when we were at about 24.5 million tons. And last time I checked, 2009 wasn\u2019t a great year in our economy either. So when we see that type of margin on that type of volume, particularly in a Q1, I feel pretty good about it, and I do feel like it is sustainable, and I think we can continue to do quite well with it.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Terrific, thank you very much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Arnie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thanks. Good afternoon, Ward and Anne.","Ward Nye","How are you doing, Todd?","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Doing well, thanks. Looking at your guidance, you\u2019ve given the volume and price guidance on a heritage basis. Can you translate that to an absolute nominal basis for us?","Ward Nye","Really what I would do \u2013 let me approach it this way, Todd. Let\u2019s go back and talk about the acquisition effect because I think that can probably help you. If we just looked at total heritage volume, I want to say that was probably up seven points, total volume up about 7.3%, pricing up around 1.1%. I think if you go back and take a look at really what the big chunk of the acquisition is, it\u2019s really going to be Denver, although we clearly did buy a business in San Antonio midyear last year. So if you come back with that and assume, we\u2019re probably looking at an incremental 8 million tons on those acquisitions on the stone side, probably an incremental 800,000 cubic yards on the ready-mix side, and around 1.5 million on the hot mix side. I think that will probably get you where you want to be, Todd.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Got it, thank you. That helps a lot. Thinking about the Colorado assets, you provided us with a pre-tax and after-tax impact of that operation. Could you tell us what gross profit was?","Ward Nye","You can see that it cost us $0.17 for the quarter. And what I would encourage you to do, just assume that that\u2019s going to be tough to make up to the full year. And keep in mind what we said is that\u2019s a business that\u2019s going to be accretive to us in 2013. What we like is the timing in which we\u2019ve come into that market.","Let me give you some facts to think about relative to Denver as we look at the business, Todd. I was reading AGC America the other week. It stated that Denver leads the nation in new construction jobs. And if you look at the 12 months ended in February, it added around 6,300 jobs. With respect to homes in the Denver market from really when the trough hit, we\u2019ve seen inventory down around 42%. Multifamily is up 21%, and we\u2019re seeing new subdivisions come into that market as well. So even if we look at our ready-mix business there and our hot-mix business there, we\u2019re seeing nice levels of bidding activity, not just on subdivisions, but we\u2019re seeing work at the University of Colorado student housing. We\u2019re seeing work at the VA hospital. We\u2019re seeing Denver Museum of Sciences work. And even when we look at HMA, we\u2019re seeing good municipal work, and bidding has accelerated pretty considerably. We\u2019ve actually bid on in excess of 500 projects in that market. So you\u2019ll recall the strategic reasons that we thought moving into Denver was a nice move and a good time for Martin Marietta to have a one or two position in Denver, so hopefully with that volume data that I\u2019ve given you and at least some of the market detail that I\u2019ve provided, that can help you some more in Denver.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","That does help. Given the diesel has risen as I believe it had this time last year, you guys ended up going for around a midyear price increase in a lot of your markets. Is anything like that in the offing this year, do you think?","Ward Nye","Todd, I think it is. Clearly, the midyear pricing that we went out with last year did give us some tailwind coming into this year. And you\u2019ll recall last year when we came to about this time of the year, diesel was up I want to say 30% at that time as well. So as we continue to watch it march up, it is our intention to go back to a number of markets across the United States and look for midyear price increases. It\u2019s simply time to try to share some of this. We have a lot of input issues that people simply understand, and this is a real one. And if you\u2019re looking at first quarter, we burned 6.1 million gallons of diesel fuel. And if you look at the full year last year, we were somewhere around 28.5 million gallons. So diesel fuel is not an insignificant expense. Now energy around 12% of our cost of goods, diesel is around 8% of that 12%. So it\u2019s not something that\u2019s actually going to just push you to the edge, but it is something that you need to come back and address, and we do intend to do that midyear.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Excellent, and then final one for me. If we think about the Vulcan bid and the conversations that you\u2019re having with them, you gave us an update and some timing on that. I appreciate that. I think this is one of the bigger issues that that people see around the deal. Can you talk about how that\u2019s going relative to expectations, or is it just too soon for that?","Ward Nye","You know what, Todd, it\u2019s probably too soon for that. I do think we\u2019ll have resolution to that here in the not too distant future. And of course, part of what you look for is to see if you feel like you\u2019re running into any remarkable surprises. We\u2019ve done our homework on this. We feel like we understand it very well. And again, we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re. I know people want an answer to that. And we want to give you that and we\u2019re working hard on it right now.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Perfect, thanks a lot.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Todd.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. Just in terms of weather obviously has been a good benefit for the past two quarters. To the best of your ability, how much do you think weather helped overall demand in the quarter? And along with that, what are you seeing now in terms of the demand; in other words, what you see now may be an indication that demand may not have been pulled forward?","Ward Nye","I tell you what, Kathryn, I\u2019ll do this. I\u2019ll tell you about now in August. The two months that I think are important during the course of the year, I think May is the critically important month. I think that really gives you good sense of what kind of rhythm contractors have. October is an important month too, but I\u2019ll tell you about April and May when we get together for the Q2.","Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell you though. I think weather clearly helped. When we talk, for example, about our Midwest business, and clearly you would not have doubled agricultural lime shipments but for the good weather. At the same time, that isn\u2019t just tremendous volume. You\u2019re going from probably 250,000 tons to 400,000 and some tons. It\u2019s not necessarily going to move the needle. One reason that I would actually downplay to a degree what was happening with the weather is you\u2019ve still got half of this business that\u2019s driven by infrastructure. And most of these markets that are driven by infrastructure are going to have a fairly refined time in which you can do infrastructure work. And most DOTs are going to have that period of time from December 15 to March 15 as a point in time that really you\u2019re not going to be able to lay, for example, spec asphalt. So that\u2019s where your contractors are typically going to come back until mid-March under any of that.","So to the extent that you\u2019re seeing some pickup there, I think what that\u2019s evidence of is a much stronger housing circumstance and a much stronger non-res area as well. Now keep in mind when we say much stronger, all things are relative because it\u2019s coming back from such a remarkably low base. So do I think weather helped, Kathryn? Yes, I do. Do I think it really just changed things dramatically? Not particularly.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Great. In your prepared comments, you had some commentary about mix benefiting the quarter for certain regions. On a whole, would you say, how much was the benefit of mix versus price or price increases as a whole for the regions where you did have improvement in pricing?","Ward Nye","As a whole, I wouldn\u2019t say it was that profound. If we looked at the Mideast, pricing was down in the Mideast. But the fact that it was down was truly driven by one project in the Mid-Atlantic that was simply a cheap sand product. We went back and looked and said if we had taken that out and had the same mix this year that we had last year, we actually would have seen pricing up a very small percentage in the Mideast. If we go to the Southeast, I don\u2019t think mix was very remarkable there at all. To the extent that mix mattered in the West, again, it would have been simply sending some material in South Texas to a yard in particular in South Texas. But at this time of year, again, I don\u2019t think it moved the needle that much either. So I think what you\u2019re seeing is really more really what\u2019s going on as opposed to simply a shell game with mix.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Okay. I think you guys \u2013 you said that at one point in time you might have a DOJ update by the end of April. Is there any color you can pass on that today?","Ward Nye","No. Kathryn, I think what I said in my prepared remarks is really where I need to be on that, and that is we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making going through DOJ. We continue to have dialogue with them. And when we said we thought we\u2019d have something around mid-May, it\u2019s May 1, so we\u2019re talking couple of weeks at this time.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Okay, all right. Great, thanks so much for taking my questions today.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC","Good afternoon. I\u2019m just following up on Kathryn\u2019s question. You guys had issued a press release saying that \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to make sure I got my facts right, looking for some clarification. I think you guys had stated that you were looking to get in the second half of April from the DOJ investigating staff a consent order. And barring that consent order, you wouldn\u2019t seek to close the Vulcan transaction prior to mid-August. So are you telling us that hasn\u2019t happened, so you\u2019re looking to close the deal after August?","Ward Nye","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we\u2019re saying at all. I think what we\u2019re trying to say in the timing agreement is clearly we are working with DOJ on what I think with most of you is a very expedited basis. And I think DOJ and we continue to approach it in that fashion. And I guess what we\u2019re saying now is we think we might be a couple of weeks later than we thought we would have been before. I think that\u2019s really it, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC","So same trajectory in terms of your original objectives.","Ward Nye","That is certainly our aim, correct.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Just switching gears from an operational standpoint, you got a big surge in sales in the West Group, and at the same time a couple million dollars of loss, minus $5 million versus minus $3 million last year. I\u2019m trying to get through in my head the math in the sense that I recognize that it\u2019s a tremendous sales growth number. I thought the margin would follow a little bit better due to operating leveraging in the business. Can you help me understand what\u2019s going on there?","Ward Nye","It was really all the acquisitions and just bringing that in and really doing what we need to do to make those look like a part of our usual heritage business. So I think that\u2019s the moving parts that you\u2019re seeing, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC","So that\u2019s the 8 million tons and that\u2019s the Denver and Texas impact going into 1Q?","Ward Nye","That\u2019s exactly right.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC","And just to clarify a little bit further, and let me know if I\u2019m getting too granular. You have reverse seasonality in Denver in the sense that you\u2019re expecting Denver to be less profitable versus the other shipments in the first quarter typically?","Ward Nye","I think that\u2019s exactly right. Denver, unlike a lot of the rest of the United States, really had a real winter this past year, and it\u2019s always will in the Rockies. We joked a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but we were right when we said it. If you go to the aggregate purchasing handbook, you probably don\u2019t buy Rocky Mountain business in the middle of December, and we knew we would simply have to weather that though Q1. So you\u2019re entirely right; it\u2019s going to have a different trajectory there.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC","That\u2019s helpful, and just one final one, if I could sneak it in. Would it be \u2013 maybe this is for Anne. Does $125 million for SG&A spend this year sound like the right number. And is there any leverage in that going forward? Thanks for the questions.","Anne Lloyd","Yes, I think, Bob, it\u2019s in the ballpark. The big leverage there is going to be, obviously, with the Denver acquisition, we\u2019ve got some incremental overhead that we\u2019ll be incurring there this year. And as we continue to synergize that business through the course of the year, get the acquisition fully integrated, we should be able to bring that down in 2013 and beyond.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC","Any guess of magnitude what you can take off that? I\u2019m just trying to figure out...","Anne Lloyd","Not at this point. We\u2019re probably still a little premature in that regard, but we should be able to give you some color on that later this year.","Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC","Got it, thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rodny Nacier of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi, Ward.","Ward Nye","Good afternoon, Rodny.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","My first question is on pricing and the guidance for 2012. With the upward but choppy recovery that we\u2019re starting to see by end market mix, product mix, and regional mix, does the 2% to 4% pricing guide account for all these factors, or are you more assuming an apples-to-apples comparison excluding those factors?","Ward Nye","Yes, we\u2019ve done our best to go out and piece together what we think is going on out there, Rodny. I think we\u2019ve tried to capture as many of those factors as we can in the 2% to 4%. Now keep in mind, the 2% to 4% does not take into account anything that we may be able to do on midyear price increases. But as you\u2019ve heard me say before, even if you put in a midyear price increase, you only capture about a quarter of the benefit of that during the year in which it\u2019s put in. It gives you a better bar going in to the following year. But did that answer your question on the ASPs?","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","I guess I\u2019m where I need to be. And my second question is on the adjustments for Denver. Was the adjustment for the profit in this quarter, was that tied to the seasonal weakness, or should we be expecting going forward each quarter be adjusting the lumpiness in the Denver profits and losses by quarter?","Ward Nye","Clearly, this is going to \u2013 given the first quarter and the pure seasonality of it, I think what we\u2019re saying is you\u2019ve seen the toughest quarter that Denver would have. And we\u2019re saying for this year in many respects you can just take that and carry it through. I think that\u2019s probably what we\u2019re saying right now, Rodny.","Rodny Nacier \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, all right. Thank you very much, and I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Rodny.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Hi, guys. How are you doing?","Ward Nye","Good, Ted. How are you?","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Great. So I was hoping to come to aggregate margins, and I apologize if I\u2019m just a little slow figuring this out. But in the last five quarters, by our account you\u2019ve had very strong pricing. So when we look at the incrementals, and I know that there are a lot of moving variables that have influenced the last four quarters on the margin side.","But they just look a lot weaker than I think we would have expected given the pricing you\u2019ve gotten, including 1Q, where call it underlying operating margins \u2013 incrementals, excuse me, look like mid-teens. Historically, we\u2019ve talked about normalized as call it something in the 60% range. I know you\u2019ve talked about diesel being up 15%. You\u2019ve talked about energy being up 18%. That\u2019s 12% of your cost structure. But you had better pricing probably than we would have expected.","Maybe others were more optimistic. And weather certainly the last couple of quarters would have been a productivity benefit. Could we just review? Is there anything that has changed? Are there issues that I\u2019m just forgetting about that would help me understand why the incrementals have been so far below what we\u2019d look for in this kind of environment where you\u2019re getting some growth?","Ward Nye","Ted, I think the issues are probably twofold. And I think the issues are purely the level of volume that you\u2019re seeing in Q1, again relatively low volumes. And I think the other is simply going back and I know it\u2019s hard to see from where you\u2019re sitting. It\u2019s tied into how much we\u2019re sending from producing locations to yards right now. In the first quarter, we simply needed to build some inventories at some of our yards.","And that cost was going to be a very different number simply as we\u2019re trying to build some inventories here in the first quarter. I can tell you that as we look at the business and we contemplate what margins and incremental margins will look like as volumes come back, we continue to be very comfortable and very committed to the types of numbers that we\u2019ve given you and the others as well.","Anne Lloyd","And, Ted, if I could just add some more color to that, the real issue is that you\u2019ve got, if you look at the segment information, you\u2019ve got acquisitions buried in there. So if you think the heritage business same-on-same, so to speak, same-store sales, look at the incremental gross margins there.","If you look at a couple of the impacts of energy as well as the impact of restocking the yards, which will be sales that come in the future but those costs get taken today, our incrementals are in excess of 50% on our heritage business, a little bit shy of the 60% target that we have on average, not too far out of the ballpark. Part of that is addressed by some of the supplies, repair, and maintenance costs that we\u2019ve had to accelerate into the quarter because we did get started just a little bit earlier. I think there is just so much noise around the comparability of margins, it\u2019s difficult to tell on the face of the financials.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","That\u2019s very helpful. And just so I\u2019m somewhat calibrated for the second quarter, I know you did point out that you had absorbed some excess costs in the first quarter due to better than expected production, and that\u2019s a supply cost problem. Should we look for second quarter to have the reverse of that and a benefit on the incremental side, or is that a trend that you think is going to continue to build up for a couple quarters anyway?","Ward Nye","I think you can certainly look for a degree of benefit from that going through. I think when you do come back and you start earlier, you can simply take a look at the M&R and supply line. Our supply line was up around 19% for the first quarter, and really that\u2019s going to explosives. It\u2019s going to belting. It\u2019s going to fuel. It\u2019s going to a number of different items. And on a percentage basis, that\u2019s a big pop. And I think as we come into Q2, you\u2019ll certainly see the appropriate moderation there.","Anne Lloyd","Essentially Ted, your startup costs, if you think about it, you had facilities somewhat not deliver for a period of time. You\u2019re going to have some startup costs. Those have gotten moved into the first quarter and shouldn\u2019t repeat themselves. So we\u2019re expecting to see that trend reverse.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. The second thing I was hoping to ask is, I know Ward made some specific comments about initiatives with the DOTs in Texas and Iowa. But if we look at the contract awards for your top ten states in the first quarter, they are down something on the order of 40%, which is not insignificant. And the last three months have been pretty bad trends for the whole industry. So it\u2019s not just your states; there are certainly states that are worse. But I know you made some comments in your prepared remarks. But I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us some sense of how to think about this data, just given that at least through the first quarter the awards are looking pretty bearish, for a lack of a better word.","Ward Nye","I\u2019ll let you know a lot of that was twofold, in fact. It\u2019s simply where people are or not on the highway bill. And I think you\u2019re seeing a certain degree of the stimulus come out as well. Keep in mind, a very different stimulus circumstance this year. When we came into 2011, there was around 22% of stimulus that was left. When we came into this year, around 14% was left. And by our math, around 2% of it went already this year, so there is only about 12% of that left. I think you\u2019re still seeing a lot of timing issues there, Ted.","And back to my point earlier, if we take a look at really where NC DOT is and I look at their five-year work plan, they\u2019re looking at a 2012 \u2013 2013 work plan of $3.8 billion, a 2013 and 2014 work plan of $3.9 billion. At the same time, if we look at Texas, keep in mind they\u2019re an August 31 fiscal year; $4.4 billion this year, $4.5 billion in 2013, and that doesn\u2019t take into account the additional $2 billion that we identified in my prepared remarks as well. So I think you have a timing issue. I think you have highway bill issue, and I think you have the stimulus issue describing the numbers that you\u2019re seeing. As we go back and take a look at the DOTs and where they are and what we think their spending will be, it does give us a good sense of confidence there.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","All right. That\u2019s very helpful, guys; best of luck this quarter.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Ted.","Anne Lloyd","Thanks, Ted.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, good afternoon.","Ward Nye","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Ward, can you talk about the extent of cost cutting that you expect on the Denver assets, taking out of the equation any volume recovery over the next couple of years just in terms of running the business operationally, as you do at your other sites? What are your targets perhaps on a percent of sales basis or whatever you think is the right way to frame that?","Ward Nye","I think it\u2019s probably too early be come out and give specific targets on that. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll tell you, Jerry, and this is what I\u2019m pleased with in Denver. We\u2019ve given you an overview of really how that market is behaving right now. I think the one thing that we haven\u2019t spoken much about is the team that we put in place. And what we have in Denver is a team, a, that has a lot of history in Denver, and b, a team that has some history with us; and we think those two things are incredibly important.","And we have a business, we have a team, and we have a culture that we\u2019re confident that\u2019s extremely well with where we are. And we\u2019re obviously going through a first quarter and second quarter process of integrating that business into our normal operating processes systems-wise and otherwise. So to come back and give you very specific numbers right now I think would be premature. But I\u2019d come back and reaffirm what we said before. This is a transaction that we believe puts us in a great market. We\u2019re excited about what we bought. We\u2019re excited about who is with us, and we feel like that\u2019s going to be a nicely accretive business for us as we go into 2013.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And as we take a look at the margin structure of the business today relative to your overall aggregates segment, the lower margins here, is that a function of business mix with the ready-mix business in there, or is this business at a different point in the cycle and the recovery in margins in this business in 2013, how much of that is in your mind volume versus cost measures?","Ward Nye","We know we can control costs. It\u2019s tougher to control volume, so we\u2019re going to go after it appropriately on the cost side. I think at the same time, if you come back and look at the numbers that I talked about earlier and you assume it\u2019s going to be 800,000 cubic yards of ready-mix and 1.5 million tons of hot mix, that\u2019s basically taking the hot mix exposure we had wholly before and doubling it. So we had around \u2013 I want to say 1.4 million tons last year.","This is about 1.5 million that came in with this. I think at the same time, if we had gone back last year and looked at our heritage ready-mix business, it was probably somewhere around, just call it 450,000 cubic yards. So coming back with this is also a pretty big chunk. It\u2019s different than we would have had in the past, but that\u2019s how that Denver market is built, and that\u2019s how you have to be structured to compete there.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And on the pricing side, very good price increases for your businesses. Can you talk about what kind of price increases you\u2019re seeing out of ready-mix and asphalt mix customers in areas where you\u2019re not vertically integrated? How aggressive are they being about pricing over the past couple of months?","Ward Nye","We\u2019re clearly seeing a better trend on that. The toughest area that we had seen in trying to get price increases has been in the ready-mix community. And I think that\u2019s a business that in part has come to the conclusion that they can no longer save themselves to prosperity, and we\u2019re certainly looking for price increases there. We\u2019re certainly looking for it in liquid \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, in asphalt as well. Keep in mind, liquid asphalt itself is moving around. And as that moves, it can help other aspects of it.","Probably one thing that you\u2019d like to know, Jerry, is if we look at just liquid asphalt prices in the quarter through Q1 2012, they were ranging anywhere from call it $515 up to around $550 a ton. And that\u2019s up year over year from something that was probably closer to the low to mid-$400s last year, and the trend continues to be anywhere from $50 to $100 a ton up. So to answer your question directly, I think ready-mix producers are clearly understanding that they need to handle their cost structure differently and we are seeing price increases there. And we are looking for them and we\u2019re doing the same on asphalt.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Anne, is there a way to frame the range and pricing conditions like you\u2019re seeing by region just to help us get a sense of the variability? Perhaps what portion of your business are you seeing year-over-year pricing increases versus flat to down?","Ward Nye","The best way to look at that, Jerry, is look at the different periods we have ahead of us. I\u2019m seeing pricing up as high as low teens. I\u2019ve seen it down as much as mid-single digit. Where it\u2019s down mid-single digits, that tends to be one of the mix issues that we were talking about in a Mid-Atlantic state. I\u2019m sorry; we\u2019re getting some feedback, Jerry. Can you hear me okay?","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I can hear you okay.","Ward Nye","Okay, did that answer your question?","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s perfect, Ward, thank you.","Ward Nye","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Hi. Thank you, good afternoon. The first question is I was just wondering if we could follow up on a previous question with respect to the M&R costs that were pulled forward into the first quarter. Is it possible to quantify how much in your view was pulled forward into 1Q and that are going to be non-recurring?","Ward Nye","You know what, Garik, if I look at M&R costs, they were up almost 10% for the quarter. So if I really look at the big buckets that had some movement, energy we talked about the fact that it was up pretty considerably. Supplies on a percentage basis were up even more than energy, and M&R was up close to 10%. So as I look at those numbers, I feel like we will certainly get some benefit of those as we move into second quarter. Clearly, as Anne indicated before, when you\u2019re coming out of winter, when you\u2019re starting operations earlier, what\u2019s going to happen is you will have some startup costs that you probably would have incurred in some degree more in Q2, and we clearly had more of that in Q1.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out the order of magnitude. Is this a couple million dollars that won\u2019t be impacting 2Q, or is it $5 million to $10 million on this line?","Ward Nye","Garik, if you look at total production tons, they were up about 7.5% to 8%, and these costs were up in a range of 10%, 15%, 19%. You could make a pretty good case where you would expect those costs to proportionally rise. So I would argue that those pieces that are in excess of our increase in production costs are our pull-forward costs.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thanks for that. And then I guess just to dive in a little bit more in some of these markets which you experienced negative mix, in Denver and in the Mideast, you highlighted one of the projects in the Mideast as dragging down pricing. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide the timeline. Are these projects supposed to be negative to pricing mix through the balance of 2012, or will they be rolling off here sooner than later so you\u2019ll a reversal in the back half of the year?","Ward Nye","I think the issue in the Mideast rolls off actually very easily and very nicely. That was simply a sand job. When volume comes back in that much more seasonally situated business, that will be entirely muted, in my view. At the same time, what we were seeing in Denver is we were simply seeing a higher degree of base in that market compared to what we would see in most of our business. I want to say 50%-some of it was actually based in Q1, but keep in mind Q1 is not going to be a representative quarter for what goes on there. So I would take the noise around mix on those two markets, Garik, and not be particularly concerned about that going forward.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, great, and then just one more question related to the Vulcan bid. You\u2019ve taken on about $40 million of costs associated with business development expenses. I\u2019m just wondering how much more cost do you expect to be incurred. Do you think you\u2019ve seen most of it at just this point? I guess is there a point if costs do continue to accelerate, then your view of the deal would change?","Ward Nye","We obviously watch that very carefully, and this is something that we feel very deeply and feel very strongly about. We\u2019ve been clear about it. We knew it would not be an inexpensive process, and we were right on that.","Here is what I would tell you with respect to the quarter though, Garik. We had a full trial. We had a full trial in Delaware. We had all the discovery that leads up to a full trial in Delaware. We had depositions, and we had a full employment act for lawyers. That\u2019s the best way we can describe it. And I know lawyers have to eat too, but I wish they weren\u2019t eating quite so much right now. So hopefully, we have seen the worst of that for a while.","Garik, this is a deal that needs to happen. It\u2019s a deal that I feel incredibly strongly about, as I\u2019m sure you can tell from the financials and from what I\u2019ve said. I feel good about what we\u2019re trying to do. I don\u2019t feel good about the way that we\u2019re having to do it. The fact is these are two companies that ought to be together. We ought to be working together to do something great. We ought to be finding ways to bring two teams together and take the best of the best and have something that in every respect is world class. That\u2019s what I want to see. I believe that\u2019s what shareholders want to see. I don\u2019t want to spend money this way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s constructive, but we do believe in this transaction. And I know I got a little preachy on you, I apologize for that, but you can tell I feel strongly about it.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Understood, and just I\u2019d like to sneak one more in; any update with respect to potential litigation in the other states outside of Delaware?","Ward Nye","You know what, obviously, we\u2019re waiting for the chancellor in Delaware. There is very little activity underway in the Alabama litigation right now. There is some activity in New Jersey. There\u2019s not an enormous amount of activity in New Jersey. The prime areas of activity that\u2019s going on in New Jersey right now are efforts to stop us from moving forward with our independent nominees. And sadly, we anticipated that would probably be the case. But it\u2019s the level of activity that\u2019s going on there from a comparative basis I would tell you does not touch the process that we went through in Delaware.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Got it, thank you very much.","Ward Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I want to go back to the very first question that was asked regarding and where you responded with talking about all the confidence you have right now. Yet if I look at the guidance, really you went from I think 3% to 4% or 4% to 5%, and that\u2019s pretty minimal volume guidance. So if you could just talk about given the confidence why the change in guidance wasn\u2019t more significant also in light of what you just reported in terms of volume growth this quarter?","Ward Nye","You know what, we\u2019ve been in a bunker here for about four or five years now. And one thing I\u2019ll tell you, Adam, and we\u2019ve said it before, this has never been an industry that has been particularly good at calling the turn either way. And I think one thing we like to be is we like to be incredibly clear and very transparent with people. And if we\u2019re wrong or we\u2019re light on it, we\u2019ll come back and tell you about it when we get to Q2. But at the same time, I just think it\u2019s a nice problem to have to talk about taking volume guidance up. We haven\u2019t been there for a long time, so we like going back in that water.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo","And I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019ll be able to talk about this question or not. But going back to the DOJ, how should investors think about the risk of value destruction associated with a forced asset sale? And what I\u2019m most curious to hear your opinion about is the long-haul networks where quarries and sales yards might be hundreds of miles away, and where the addressable market isn\u2019t going to be just the typical 30-mile truck ship radius where there could be a much more significant addressable market.","Ward Nye","You know what, I guess it\u2019s a practical matter. There is probably not, in this context, a big difference between a local market and a distance market. You\u2019ve clearly got \u2013 that\u2019s simply the way some of these markets work. The thing that I guess I take the most comfort in with respect to it, Adam, is number one, I continue to feel confident in our analysis. Number two, we\u2019ve taken a lot of calls and continue to hear from a lot of people who very much want to have some meaningful dialogue with us on this when we\u2019re successful. So I think the number of buyers who are going to be there will be high. I think their level of interest will be considerable, and I don\u2019t candidly look at the long-haul or a local market in this context remarkably differently.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Ward Nye","Sure. Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc","Hey, good afternoon.","Ward Nye","Hi, Trey.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc","Just a couple of questions. One on you had mentioned a couple times single-family housing. Are you seeing \u2013 is this mostly builders coming into existing neighborhoods and putting down foundations and that kind of thing, or are you actually seeing a pickup in builders coming in, in the developing neighborhoods and laying the streets and sidewalks and that sort of thing?","Ward Nye","We are actually seeing both. Now what I\u2019ll tell you is I think there are probably more sticks and bricks right now than there are new subdivisions going in, Trey. But at least what I\u2019m seeing in a number of our markets is I am seeing more subdivision type work than I thought I would have. And one of the odd things is you\u2019re seeing more of that in some instances on the higher end, which is not necessarily what you would expect.","But if we\u2019re looking at single-family permits right now, the last numbers I saw were around 23% ahead of where they were in 2011. And part of what I think is a plus side at least relative to homes is the inventory of new homes is pretty lean. Again, the last number I saw was only around 150,000 new homes were available for sale across the nation, and multi-family in that continues to take the lead. But one of the big issues that I think is simply there, Trey, is you are going to have the hangover of around 3.5 million distressed homes that are still out there.","So I think you\u2019ve got some pluses on res. You\u2019ve got some minuses on res. What I\u2019m encouraged though is to see the res activity in a market, for example, like Charlotte. Charlotte was a market because of its tie to the banking industry, when that industry really went through its tough times, Charlotte was in a very, very tough spot. And you heard us speak about the customer there who suddenly is bidding on five new projects in that market, and we\u2019re seeing that repeat itself in multiple markets right now.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc","That\u2019s encouraging news. Last question is I guess for Anne. But looking at the cost savings that you guys have identified with this potential Vulcan merger, it started off $200 million to $250 million, and it was pretty detailed what was behind that number. But I think in some of the stuff in Delaware, the number that was kicked around was $300 million or $330 million. Can you talk about what\u2019s behind that bigger number, and is it just each of these boxes or categories are bigger, or is there something else there, if you can just give us a little clarity on that, please?","Anne Lloyd","Trey, I think our view on the synergy value is still that we\u2019re in the $200 million \u2013 $250 million range that we originally came out with, with our proposal. We believe that that is a valid target for us to set out in this combination.","Ward Nye","Trey, the prime \u2013 and that\u2019s the key to that. Anne said it right. It\u2019s all around the notion of the combination. It\u2019s not going through single buckets here or there. It\u2019s taking a look at what SG&A looks like. It\u2019s going through the operating efficiencies, taking a look on what can be done from a purchasing perspective. But it\u2019s all driven by the concept of the combination.","Anne Lloyd","And we\u2019ve always approached it in a range mentality out of those three major buckets, Trey.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens Inc","Okay, thanks a lot and good luck.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Trey.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Olin of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Chris Olin \u2013 Cleveland Research","Hi.","Ward Nye","Hi, Chris.","Chris Olin \u2013 Cleveland Research","With respect to that Specialty Products segment, there have been some indications from the steel industry that the integrated mills will shift toward greater natural gas consumption in order to reduce that coal component, also some focus toward iron substitute plants. I\u2019m just wondering if that could have any impact on your volume going forward.","Ward Nye","As we\u2019re seeing it right now, we\u2019re not hearing or having any material discussion about that having an impact. If we\u2019re looking at steel right now, it\u2019s running around 79% of capacity. The fact is if it\u2019s running anywhere near 70% of capacity, it\u2019s going to work pretty well for us. Chris, I know you follow the steel industry pretty closely. And the last number I saw I think at the end of March, it was running at about 1.9 million tons per week, so it\u2019s running at a pretty healthy clip right now. But we\u2019ve certainly not had any indications from our customers that we\u2019re looking at any degree of degradation based on the issues that you raised.","Chris Olin \u2013 Cleveland Research","Okay, thank you. And then just quickly, did you break out how much of your heritage aggregate volumes are directed into the energy sector right now in terms of a percentage or anything like that?","Ward Nye","What we did talk about what we\u2019re selling into the ChemRock and rail component. A portion of that is going to be basically what we\u2019re using for scrubber. A different portion of it, particularly what we\u2019re selling into the shale fields, will be under the non-res piece.","But I\u2019ll tell you, last year if we took a look at what we were selling relative to energy and shale, it would have been around 4.2 million tons. So I think you can take that and say it\u2019s probably going to be a little bit better than that this year. It\u2019s going to move around in the shale fields. But if you took that 4.2 million and then came back and probably added another, call it maybe a couple million tons for other power related projects and then came back and took a look at the agricultural line, that will give you a pretty good feel for portions of it.","Chris Olin \u2013 Cleveland Research","So there should be no major impact from the natural gas, the cutback in drilling and places like Arkansas slowing down?","Ward Nye","What I think is going to happen is that we\u2019ll move around. And I think that\u2019s a fair observation, Chris, because keep in mind; given our rail construct in particular, we can hit the Marcellus. We can hit the Haynesville. We can hit Barnett. We can hit Eagle Ford. We can hit Niobrara, and we can hit the Bakken. So we have the ability to go into all of those different deposits. Now there is a migration, and you can see it, for example, in Chesapeake\u2019s numbers. Where people are coming more quickly out of places like Haynesville and Barnett, they tend to be going into the Eagle Ford. So clearly, we have felt some degree of volume decline in a place like Arkansas because of that. There is just no...","Anne Lloyd","And we saw that last year, Chris, so we have already experienced that movement. It was that quick.","Chris Olin \u2013 Cleveland Research","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Sure, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Hughes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","Yes, just one question on the highway bill. If we were to get a highway bill, how long would it take \u2013 a long-term highway bill, how long would it take for increased business that that would result in come and to take to get to market?","Ward Nye","You know what, if we got a highway bill, I would tell you to really feel any significant tailwind from it, you\u2019re probably nine months or so out from that...","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","You\u2019ve never seen it. Is that another way to look at it?","Ward Nye","Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair point Keith.","Keith Hughes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson","Okay, that\u2019s all. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Betts of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, Ward and Anne; two areas of questioning from me, first I guess directed at you, Ward. Just back for the Denver distortion there, I think you said you added 8 million tons of rock from the acquisition. What was lost in the full year from the River system? And also just to clarify, I think in the press release, it talks about the overall impact being neutral at the EBITDA level of that transaction. So presumably, we are going to see a reversal of that minus $12.5 million. Maybe I just misheard earlier, but presumably we will see a reversal of that in Q2 \u2013 Q3, just to clarify that.","And then for you Anne, and maybe I misread it, but I think in the press release, it refers to reduction in the tax rate. I think it was previously estimated to be 26% this year, I think it\u2019s now 22%. One, is that correct? And if so, what are the factors behind it? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Okay. Mike, first of all, I don\u2019t think you miss much, so here is what I would come back and say. You\u2019re talking about 8 million tons. Actually if you go back, I think what I\u2019ve said is it was 8 million tons between what we did in the Texas acquisition last year and the Denver acquisition. I didn\u2019t actually break down percentages between Denver and Texas, so that 8 million tons would have been a cumulative between those two different markets.","To your point, Q2 will clearly be better than Q1. Q3 will be better than Q2 or Q1. We do anticipate really keeping about level, all things considered, by the time we\u2019re finished Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 really on where we are in Denver right now as we finish the full year. And again, that\u2019s simply part of the integration process.","Anne Lloyd","And that\u2019s on the earnings line.","Ward Nye","Correct.","Anne Lloyd","Not the EBITDA line.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And on the River system, how much volume went with the assets that went on the River system?","Ward Nye","Yes, I want to go back and look, but I want to say the volumes on the River system were actually pretty consistent, maybe a little bit light from where we are on this 8 million tons we\u2019ve given you. It\u2019s a little bit below that.","Anne Lloyd","I think it was about 6 million tons.","Ward Nye","6.5 million to 7.5 million tons.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, thank you; and on tax?","Anne Lloyd","Yes, you read it right, 23% tax rate. That\u2019s really we reevaluated the tax rate during this quarter that we expect for the year. The majority of that, Mike, principally relates to the impact of the transaction cost on pre-tax income and then that impact on all of the permanent deductions, principally depletion. So essentially, we\u2019re picking up more permanent depletion.","Mike Betts \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, understood. Thank you very much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thielman of DA Davidson. Please go ahead.","Brent Thielman \u2013 DA Davidson","Thanks. My questions have been answered, good luck in the quarter.","Ward Nye","Thank you very much, Brent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Clyde Lewis of Citi. Please go ahead.","Clyde Lewis \u2013 Citi","Good afternoon, Ward and Anne; just one from me, if I may please, on the city of Millett municipality spending, it\u2019s obviously tough to bid on state level activity, particularly in Southern Texas and North Carolina, I\u2019m just wondering if you can maybe just put a little bit more color on the activity levels or the lower level of government at the moment.","Ward Nye","The lower level of government is doing in large part what the higher level government is doing, Clyde, and that is they\u2019re really focused on maintenance and repair. Here is a significant difference, though, and we\u2019re seeing this happen at local level after local level, and that is they are going forward with bond referendums. And when they\u2019re going forward with bond referendums, the nice news is, and we\u2019ll look at here in our backyard. We saw it in Raleigh. We saw it Durham.","Statistics have shown that the bond referendums when you go forward with them, if it\u2019s related to transportation and it\u2019s a local issue, tend to pass around 75% of the time. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing on those. So we\u2019re seeing good, steady, maintenance type work at the city and muni levels. Part of what I referenced in my prepared comments, of course, dealt with more snowbound areas. And they were taking what would typically be snow removal dollars, since they didn\u2019t need to use them this year and simply putting them to maintenance and repair. And that\u2019s why we felt like that would be incremental to our business. Is that responsive to your question, Clyde?","Clyde Lewis \u2013 Citi","Yes, that\u2019s a bit more color. So thank you very much.","Ward Nye","All right. Clyde, thank you very much.","Operator","I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. And I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ward Nye for any closing remarks.","Ward Nye","I\u2019d be remiss not to take this opportunity to thank our employees and their families who put forward remarkable effort every day to allow us to operate safely, control costs, deliver results, and execute toward strategic initiatives. With respect to those initiatives, we know you\u2019re waiting for clarity regarding both the Delaware litigation and the DOJ regulatory review. And in that regard, May should be a busy month as we continue to pursue the business combination with Vulcan. Later today, we will release and file an updated presentation outlining our most current view of the proposed transaction, and we\u2019ll continue to keep you updated as appropriate.","There is undeniable strategic and industrial logic in the combination of Martin Marietta and Vulcan. However, Vulcan seems to continue to fundamentally mischaracterize our proposal, ignore its own inflated trading multiple, and set unrealistic expectations for the relative timing and extent of their recovery.","We do want a make a few points clear. Our stock-for-stock combination proposal does not cash out Vulcan shareholders. Instead, it does provide Vulcan shareholders an approximately 58% continuing ownership in a stronger entity with an immediately derisked balance sheet, meaningful dividend restoration, shared synergies through a more realistic view of near-term economic recovery, and shared upside through the economic cycle. Our stock-for-stock combination proposal does not undervalue Vulcan.","Instead, it does provide a tax-free combination. And in fact, it values Vulcan at approximately 17 times its projected 2012 EBITDA. Finally, our stock-for-stock combination proposal does not exploit cyclical lows. Instead, it does underscore our belief that Vulcan\u2019s share price given its current trading multiple already reflects expected economic recovery.","Martin Marietta continues to outperform Vulcan in nearly every relevant measure. During the quarter, we had stronger aggregate pricing growth, grew net sales at a faster rate, and generated stronger absolute margins than Vulcan. We continue to operate with what we believe are industry leading SG&A levels as a percentage of the net sales and, again, set quarterly records in our Specialty Products business.","It does all come down to value and we believe both Martin Marietta and Vulcan\u2019s shareholders stand to benefit from this powerful combination. Vulcan shareholders have an opportunity to send a strong message to their Board by electing Martin Marietta\u2019s independent nominees to the Vulcan Board and support the transaction for their shareholders. We ask you to please do so.","All that said, thank you again for joining our first quarter 2012 earnings call and for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. Our first quarter trends and initiatives should lead to a successful year. We look forward to discussing our second quarter results in August. Have a very pleasant day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"13750":["Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions].As a reminder this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Mr. Nye, please go ahead.","Ward Nye","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As announced in this morning's release, we reported a first quarter profit for the first time since 2008, another validation of our recent growth initiatives and cost management programs.","Our results reflect aggregates product line volume growth, and a double-digit pricing increase, which we achieved despite severe late winter weather in many markets, and significant rainfall in Texas, which we estimate reduced West Group earnings by $13 million, or $0.12 per diluted share.","The Magnesia Specialties business generated first quarter record net sales and gross profit and the acquired operations provided a significant contribution to our earnings and cash flow.","Before providing specific comments on the quarter, I am pleased to tell you that the foundation, position and momentum within our business should translate into strong growth, as we expect to benefit from an environment of increasing demand for construction materials.","As a preparatory reminder, today's conference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws, in connection with future events, or future operating or financial performance, like other businesses, we're subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially.","Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments, or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our first quarter earnings release, and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","Consistent with recent quarters, I'll discuss the results with the Heritage business separately from those of the acquired operations, which include the legacy TXI business, and two other small aggregates product line operations. While it's currently important to consider the results of Heritage versus acquired operations, so that we're fully transparent with our results and you can analyze and evaluate the quality of our financial performance.","This comparison becomes less meaningful as we complete the integration of the TXI operations into our core business. In addition, to facilitate this discussion we've made available during this webcast and on our website, supplemental financial information that presents details of our performance.","First, as detailed on slide two, the Heritage Martin Marietta business, which includes Magnesia specialties, provides the same-on-same comparison to the prior year first quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on slide four.","And finally, on slide six, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better analyze our current performance.","Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the Heritage business. Slide three provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the Heritage aggregates business. First, we're pleased to report pricing growth across our entire company.","It's important to note that the prior year first quarter includes shipments from three facilities in the West Group that were divested in the third quarter of 2014. Consequently to obtain true comparable volume variances, shipments from these three locations should be excluded from the prior year quarter.","After making this adjustment, West Group volumes were up slightly, while shipments from the Heritage aggregates business increased 7%. Further, and as you're aware, our businesses is an outdoor undertaking, and weather can disproportionately affect quarterly results, particularly so in the first quarter.","On the whole, winter weather was modestly better across our enterprise during the early portion of the quarter, as compared to last year. However, Texas precipitation this year was above average near record levels, according to the National Climatic Data Center. In fact, we estimate approximately 1.4 million tons of aggregates product line shipments were deferred from the first quarter to the remainder of the year.","Heritage West Group aggregate volumes, excluding statements from the divested operations from the prior year quarter would have increased approximately 7.5%, had we not incurred weather delays.","Ready mix concrete shipments were reduced by approximately 200,000 cubic yards, naturally profitability from these product lines was also negatively affected by lower production and efficiency levels.","As previously discussed, we estimate West Group earnings were reduced by up to $13 million during the quarter. Despite these headwinds, our commitment to operational excellence, cost discipline, and continued synergy realization from the acquired businesses enabled us to post a very strong quarter.","Aggregates product line growth was led by the infrastructure end use market, and driven by large projects. Notable growth was experienced in North Carolina and Iowa. This trend coincides with indicators of further recovery in the eastern half of the United States as North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida all now rank in the top five states for job growth, a clear stimulus for construction activity.","Texas is second in the nation in job growth and the State Department of Transportation has the fiscal 2015 letting budget of nearly $9 billion. This amount includes funds provided by Texas' Proposition 1 constitutional amendment, which addresses needed road repairs, including infrastructure work in south Texas.","This amendment is expected to provide over $1 billion per annum for the foreseeable future and in fact over $1 billion has already been allocated to specific districts within Texas. This 2015 activity coupled with an existing backlog should generate robust infrastructure construction activity over the next several years.","Additionally on March 1, 2015, Iowa enacted a $0.10 per gallon increase in the state gas tax, which is expected to increase annual infrastructure funding by approximately $215 million. Several other states, including North Carolina and Georgia are considering additional legislative measures to increase state level funding.","We are pleased to see states continue to prioritize funding infrastructure initiatives while Congress deliberates the long-term Federal Highway bill. The provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, or MAP 21, have been extended through May 31st, and we anticipate another continuing resolution through the fall, while Congress works towards passage of a multi year bill.","Shipments to the non-residential end use market were up slightly, as the economic recovery enters a more construction centric phase. For us, this market is broadly comprised of two components, light and heavy construction. And importantly, we're beginning to see a nascent return to a 50\/50 balance between these two categories, a normal equilibrium.","The light non-residential component is primarily office and retail, and demand of this component is generally tied more directly to residential demand with a 12 to 18-month lag. The heavy component is primarily industrial building and energy, with both direct and energy related shipments serving this area.","The heavy non-residential end use market represented 25% of quarterly Heritage aggregates volumes, and shipments increased 1% over the prior year quarter. Texas leads the country with $39 billion in non-residential starts during the trailing 12-months ended March 2015, and billions more expected to be started.","Further, diversified state economies have generated other non-residential and infrastructure projects to replace direct energy sector shipments, currently displaced by volatile oil prices.","The company expects energy related construction activity to remain strong, supported by more than $100 billion of planned projects along the Gulf Coast, including a significant portion in Texas.","The residential end use market represented 15% of Heritage aggregate shipments and increased 4% compared with the prior year quarter. The overall rate of residential growth has slowed compared with the last few years, in part due to an inventory reduction in the availability of unimproved building lots in our markets.","We were encouraged to see Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina join Colorado, in recording double-digit growth in housing starts for the trailing 12-months through March. This represents yet another sign of recovery in the eastern United States.","Finally, to conclude the discussion of end use markets for the first quarter, the ChemRock and Rail market represented the remaining 11% of our Heritage aggregates volume, and shipments were up slightly compared to the prior year quarter.","A positive trend for this end use is the increasing investment in capacity expansion and maintenance by major railroads, which should lead to higher demand for balanced shipments.","Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 10.5% over the prior year quarter. Led by the West Group, based on what we're expecting for the remainder of the year, we're raising full year aggregates product line pricing guidance from what was a projected increase of 4% to 6%, to now an increase of 7% to 9% over our 2014 results.","Heritage Aggregates product line total production cost per ton shipped remain relatively flat compared with the prior year quarter. We continue to benefit from the decline in diesel prices and on average pay $2.04 per gallon, compared with $3.18 in the prior year quarter.","Heritage aggregates downstream related product lines increased their combined gross profit by $3 million, primarily driven by the ready mix concrete product line, where nearly 11% increase in average selling price, led to a 490 basis point increase in the product line gross margin.","Gross profit for the Heritage Aggregates business increased $27 million and was 9.7% of net sales, an improvement of 730 basis points over the prior year quarter. All reportable segments generated a higher gross margin, led by an increase of 1,040 basis points in the Southeast Group. Continued economic recovery in Georgia, and better performance by our offshore operations contributed to this improvement.","Our Heritage business generated an incremental gross margin of 76%, besting our incremental margin target of 60%. This performance was led by long-awaited recovery in both the Mideast and Southeast divisions. We expect continued economic recovery in other geographic areas hardest hit over the past several years.","The Magnesia Specialties business continues its exceptional performance and generated net sales of $58.8 million, and a gross profit of $20.2 million, both of which represent first quarter records. For the quarter the business achieved a gross margin of 34.3%, an increase of 160 basis points over the prior year quarter.","Slides four and five provide financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the first quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $32 million, on external shipments of 2.5 million tons.","Average selling price was $12.83 per ton, which reflects a product mix skewed towards higher priced sand and gravel and rail yard shipments, compared to our Heritage operations. Despite the negative impact of weather during the quarter, we're pleased to deliver gross margin improvement compared with performance in the second half of 2014.","Our recently acquired Ready Mix concrete business shipped nearly 1 million cubic yards during the quarter, at an average selling price of $88.75. This reflects the $6 per cubic yard increase implemented last August in the north Texas market.","As a reminder, pricing increases typically have a six-month lag before full realization. As indicated earlier, weather constraints during the quarter adversely affected operations, and reduced the profitability of this business by an estimated $6 million.","The cement business is benefiting from continued strength in our Texas markets, where demand is expected to exceed local supply again this year. However, first quarter operating results were negatively affected by wet weather, which delayed some shipments to the balance of the year.","For the first quarter, the business shipped 1 million tons of cement to external customers, at an average selling price of $93.41 per ton, resulting in net sales of more than $96 million. The business achieved a gross margin of nearly 20% after incurring $5.5 million of planned kiln maintenance costs.","We expect to incur $2 million of similar costs in the second quarter, with $11 million and $10 million of such expenses in both the third and fourth quarters respectively. During the first quarter, the company announced a price increase of $10 per ton in the Texas and California markets effective April 1.","Our consolidated selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were 7.8% of net sales, a decline of 120 basis points. This improvement reflects net sales growth outpacing the increase in SG&A, partially offset by higher pension expansion. We also incurred net acquisition related expenses of $1.6 million, which reflects our estimated run rate for the next few quarters.","As detailed on slide six, our reported earnings from operations for the quarter of $25.6 million improved $41.5 million from the prior year quarter loss of $15.9 million. Our synergy expectations are consistent with our most recent guidance, we should complete the systems integration for the cement and Ready Mix concrete businesses during the second quarter, in line with our integration plan.","We recorded a small income tax benefit for the quarter, driven by discrete events. However, excluding the discrete events, our effective income tax rate would have been 31%, in line with our full-year guidance. For the year, we expect to fully utilize allowable net operating loss carry forwards of $363 million, which will reduce cash taxes.","For the quarter, we generated $35 million of operating cash flow compared with $7 million for 2014. The increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid in the first quarter of 2015 for the 2014 tax year.","The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2015, was slightly less than 2.5 times in compliance with our leverage covenant, and within our targeted range.","As a reminder, we have Board authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. We expect to complete the program over the next few years. However the actual time will depend on available cash and the market price of our stock during the time frame.","Moving to our full year guidance, we anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets, both geographically, particularly in areas with stronger employment gains, and construction end use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the western United States to continue, and importantly, the economic recovery in the East to accelerate.","Overall, in our geographies we expect growth in our three largest end use markets. Infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid single digits. Non-residential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits. The residential market is expected to experience a double-digit increase, and the ChemRock\/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat.","Cumulatively, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12%, with 4% to 7% growth in the Heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations.","Again, we expect aggregate's product line pricing to now be up 7% to 9% over 2014. Aggregate's product line production cost per ton shipped is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014.","The aggregates related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales, and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. We expect net sales for the cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million, and gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million.","Magnesia Specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million, generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6%, despite an $18 million increase in Heritage pension costs over 2014.","On a consolidated basis we expect to generate earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense or EBITDA, ranging from $835 million to $875 million. Interest expense should approximate $75 million to $80 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be 31%, excluding discrete events.","Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million, which includes $35 million of synergy related capital, and $80 million for the continued development of the new Medina limestone quarry, outside of San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern and highly efficient rail connected quarry, capable of shipping products to south Texas, including Houston, for generations.","To conclude, we are very excited about the future of Martin Marietta Materials. Our commitment to core foundational pillars, world class safety, operational excellence, cost discipline, ethical conduct, sustainability, and customer satisfaction, along with the growing demand for construction materials, should lead to improved profitability, and allow us to continue to increase shareholder value.","If the operator will now give the required instructions, we'll turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Todd Vencil from Sterne Agee. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Todd Vencil","Good afternoon, guys.","Ward Nye","Hello, Todd.","Todd Vencil","Let's talk about incrementals first. 76% is a pretty good number I would say. I'm guessing strength in the price increase was a big factor in that. Can you talk about what else went into that?","Ward Nye","Yes, part of what you're seeing, Todd, you're just seeing that Southeast part of the United States come back a little bit. But you heard what those incrementals looked like in a state like Georgia, so you're entirely right. Does pricing help, yes it does. Does cost management help, yes it does. Does geographic mix where you're starting to see some business comeback help a lot, it does.","I mean, let's talk a little bit about what we saw relative to our production analysis just on the cost side. I mean, the pricing side I think you can see with greater clarity, but if we're looking at total Heritage aggregates cost per ton, they declined 17%, or 2% after adjusting for increased production volumes.","What we did, Todd, is we were able to fully capture a 36% decline per gallon in diesel costs during the quarter, but we saw Heritage production volume go up 12%, or 2.9 million tons.","So what's happening at the end of the day, is separate and distinct from what's going on in pricing, is each incremental ton was produced at 20% lower than it was in 2014 from an actual cost per ton, so you're seeing it on both sides of the equation.","The pricing I think from the release really jumps out and hits you in the face. But I think what's happening on the cost side, and what's happening geographically is important in that 76%, as well.","Todd Vencil","Got it. That's great. And then one other for me, and I'll give other people a chance to ask questions. But you talked about a pick up in subdivision development. Can you go into that a little more? Is there any quantifying you can do around that or at least talk about places where that\u2019s strengthening up?","Ward Nye","We're clearly seeing better housing in the East than we seen for a while. I mean, housing is completely following the playbook that we thought we would see. Permits were up 5%. Starts were up 10%, completions at 12%. But here are the stats that move me. Permits are ahead of starts, starts are ahead of completions.","And even when we're sitting here with those types of metrics, housing still remains well below historical averages. So I think it gives us a great deal of upside. What we're seeing too is its being fueled by employment gains.","So if you go back to those states that we outlined in my comments, where we're seeing good employment movement, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, that's what's driving a lot of that.","The other thing that I'm moved by, Todd, is the very tepid recovery in housing has really spurred pricing. So we can imagine what a really good market in housing is going to look like, but that's what we're seeing right now, Todd.","Todd Vencil","Just a follow up on that, am I right to think that subdivision development is sort of a lot steadier and longer tailed than the more sort of specifically related to, lot development or what goes on in a house?","Ward Nye","It is. One, it's a good early indicator. Two, it's longer lived. Three, it's more aggregate intensive because remember, Todd, when we talk about res, we are not just talking about the rock going into the lot development. We're talking about the lot going into the subdivision streets, the subdivision sidewalks, the subdivision utilities.","That's part of what drives the comment that I said about moving to a more construction centric phase of recovery, and that clearly is moving towards more subdivision development, yes.","Todd Vencil","Yes. Thanks a lot.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Todd.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. First question I have is around energy in Texas, just for practical purposes, the volumes that were impacted by weather particularly in March, do you view those as delayed or lost?","And then the second tag that's related to Texas, could you give more color on trends that you've seen for shale play specific volumes, and in your opinion has Prop 1, or will Prop 1 be more than enough to offset those volume losses that were going to pad build out? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Sure, Kathryn. Volume lost in Q1 is not gone. It's deferred, and it's deferred to the balance of the year. So I feel comfortable we'll capture all of that. And clearly a lot of that was driven by rain. I mean, I don't want to turn into a weatherman here today, but I looked at something to me that I thought was moving on how weather affected particularly north Texas.","If we look at water reservoirs in north Texas, a year ago they were 68% full. If we look at where they were three months ago, they were 64% full. And if we look at where they are today, they're 94% full. I mean, that's remarkable rain in north Texas. That's what among other things gives me confidence that volume has been pushed to the right, it's not volume that's gone.","What we are seeing in non-res in other parts of Texas continues to be very strong. We feel comfortable that whatever weakness we're seeing in shale energy, yes, will be picked up by housing, and yes will be picked up by other components of non-res.","And to answer your question really directly on what we're seeing relative to shale, it's an uneven story. I mean, here is what I see. I see volumes down in first quarter in Eagle Ford shale 31%. I see volumes up in Haynesville 142%. Now, the short answer is do I think they're going to be down overall just pure shale volumes? Yes, I do.","But here's my take on it, Kathryn. I think they're going to look a lot like they did in 2012. And in 2012, all rolled in we sold about 6 million tons to the different shale plays and when I think back to 2012, number one, everybody liked the way 2012 felt. And nobody really thought they would be that good.","So do we think it will be back in the 2012 level in 2015? We do. Are we seeing uneven movement in some of the plays? We are. Do we think the volume that was lost in Q1 was simply deferred? We do. I think I answered your questions. Is that responsive?","Kathryn Thompson","Yes. Yes. And then my final follow-up question, just around guidance, fantastic growth in pricing. Is the conservatism or the factors driving your decision not to raise EBITDA guidance more, is it driven by you were saying listen we just want to be conservative, or is there any other factor that we should take into consideration for that EBITDA?","Ward Nye","What Kathryn I guess what I would say to is, it's April. And pricing was just so strong, honestly. You just had to come back and adjust that. I talked through on the previous answer what we were look like on the cost profile.","So what I would say to you is the cost profile looks good. The pricing looks good. The geography looks good. And if someone wants to accuse us of being conservative, I'll probably take the accusation.","Anne Lloyd","Kathryn, we did obviously bring up the lower end of that range. So\u2026","Kathryn Thompson","That\u2019s good thing, yes.","Anne Lloyd","We did tighten it a little bit for you.","Kathryn Thompson","Yes, yes, absolutely. That\u2019s a great point, I left that out. But yes, you did title the range. But to your point, just being more conservative than getting over your skis too much?","Ward Nye","Yes, Kathryn, that's it.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions today.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Kathryn.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Timna Tanners","Yes, hello. Good afternoon.","Ward Nye","Good afternoon, Timna.","Timna Tanners","I think along the lines of Kathryn's question, I think I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the aggregate pricing in particular, because if we were to trend the first quarter through the full year, then you would already be on the high end of your guidance, so I know the first quarter can be skewed by low volumes.","But do you think that's a good run rate, or is it just back to that just seeing how it goes kind of approach?","Ward Nye","It's funny, Timna. if I look across our enterprise, prices are up everywhere. And prices are up everywhere, there are some places that pricing is up over 30%. And obviously you don't want see that everywhere, but that gives you a sense of pricing, so it's actually very strong.","And mix in the first quarter did not have a profound effect on what was going on with this. So we do want to let this play out a little bit more. But clearly, when you're seeing volumes ramp up, we're going to see the pricing come behind that.","Timna Tanners","Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. So just switching gears to some item, I'm rusty on the topic, and you announced a price hike you said for April, you mentioned specifically that Texas was tight, so it sounds like that can pass, and usually if I recall it takes a little bit of time to see that flow through like you mentioned in Ready Mix.","Are you as confident on the price increase in California, and is the market tight enough to perhaps warrant a further increase, can you comment on that?","Ward Nye","Yes, we're certainly going to come back and we're going to look at more increases in cement pricing as we get into the year. What I can tell you right now up through Q1, cement pricing in north Texas it was up 11%, and in south Texas it was up 19%. In California it was up 15%.","So to your point those are pretty nice percentage moves that we're seeing in pricing in those markets. And again we have a leading position in the Texas markets, but even where we have the leading positions I think is important.","This is not a west Texas cement play. This is a north Texas and south central Texas cement play. So we continue to feel very confident about where we sit in pricing in those markets.","Timna Tanners","Okay. So just I had to clarify those, California is looking like it sounds like just as strong as Texas. But I wasn't sure if it's not as tight a market, or if it is also looking quite tight?","Ward Nye","It is not as tight a market as Texas is, I'll certainly concede that. And the total pricing isn't right now as attractive as it is in Texas. But from a percentage perspective frankly it's moving somewhere on a percentage perspective, between where it is in south Texas and where it is in north Texas right now.","And I think that's a good sign for a market moving toward in a very steady fashion equilibrium between supply and demand.","Timna Tanners","Super. Thank you so much.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Timna.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Garik Shmois","Thank you. Just a follow-up question on cement pricing. You indicated that you had I think I heard 19% year-over-year growth in north Texas. Just wondering how much of that growth is related to lower price projects coming off backlog and being replaced by market pricing on current jobs?","And also, if you could maybe provide a little bit of color on how to think about some of these low price TXI projects, how should they roll off as you look into 2015, and what the potential mix benefit would look like over the remaining three quarters?","Ward Nye","Yes, here is the way I look at that. The different TXI price projects should roll off by the end of the year. So I think we just have to continue to feather that in throughout the year. I think it's hard to give you a percentage on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but \u2013 so that's going to be something that we will see in varying degrees for 2015. It will be gone at the end of 2015.","If you think back to what was going on on some of those longer haul cement moves, that was really more of a south Texas issue, than it was a north Texas issue. And then if we're going back to the percentages that I spoke of, the increases that we're seeing in south Texas are 19%. So I think that does come back and tie to a degree here.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up question, if there is a nit to pick we think on the quarter it would be on incremental margins in the West Group within the Aggregates business. Just wondering if you maybe can provide a little bit of clarity on specifically what is happening in the West Group, and can we realistically see incrementals in the West Group come up to look a lot like the incrementals that you are showing in your other regions?","Ward Nye","Yes, the short answer is over time you can. Here is the West Group story. It was Colorado in January and February and March, which is winter in the Rockies, and it was really going back to a story in north Texas.","If you think about what we are in Texas today after the TXI transaction, yes, our position in Houston is important, our position in San Antonio is important. Our position in Austin is important.","But the north Texas market is the biggest single market that we have there. And when we're looking at the sheer degree of rain that we had in the days that we could not work in that marketplace, that's the single biggest driver.","Now again we're seeing pricing move on a percentage basis in the West better than we are the East. That's not a surprise. In large part because it just has more room to go. But what I would say is one, dry weather is your friend, pricing is your friend, but increased efficiencies will continue to be as well. And we think we'll see that.","So with the incrementals in the West, be as attractive as the East with immediacy, no. They never really have. Do we think they'll close the gap over time? Yes. And will it close the gap at different speeds and different markets? The answer to that is yes as well.","Anne Lloyd","And Garik, this is Anne. I would remind you that we had about $13 million profit impact of weather on the West Group in the quarter.","Ward Nye","That's really north Texas.","Anne Lloyd","That's really north Texas. If you throw that, or add that back in, and you've got a pretty decent incrementals.","Garik Shmois","Okay. So if we throw that $13 million back in assuming normal weather moving forward, that's a more realistic incremental that we should be thinking about?","Ward Nye","Garik, it should be that\u2026","Anne Lloyd","Directionally, yes.","Garik Shmois","Okay. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Garik.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Trey Grooms from Stephens. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Drew Lipke","Yes, good afternoon, guys. This is Drew Lipke on for Trey.","Ward Nye","Hi, Drew.","Drew Lipke","My first question just kind of goes back to pricing in the West Group, you saw it up 17%, you mentioned volumes there relatively flat. I'm curious you talked about the Eagle Ford volumes being down 30% there, and I understand ASPs on that business are lower.","Can you talk about the mix within that piece and the impact that had on pricing overall?","Ward Nye","I can because we went and looked at mix overall in the business, and actually if anything, mix was a little bit of a headwind for us, not a tailwind for us, oddly enough. I think in part because you are seeing increased infrastructure activity in Texas. You are seeing different types of non-res.","So you're right, sometimes you're just swapping base for base. So if you're scratching there, and I understand why you would, if you're scratching there to try to find out is there some noise and what's going on from a mix perspective, that's either masking or otherwise confusing the pricing story there's really not\u2026","Anne Lloyd","Yes, if you look at the actual numbers Drew, it is like 2 basis points. So it's no impact.","Drew Lipke","Okay. Good to hear. And then on the EBITDA guidance, you raised the lower end, I am curious, you budgeted originally back in October, and you're using October diesel prices at the time, you said diesel was $2.09 in the quarter. So does your current guidance, what kind of diesel impact does that reflect?","Ward Nye","We're capturing some of that, Drew, candidly we're not capturing all of that because none of us are so good to sort out exactly what we think that's going to be for the balance of the year.","So again, perhaps there is an element of conservatism in that, and we're willing to take that. And again we'll come back and talk to you more about it when we're back in half year. But that's really how we're approaching it right now.","Drew Lipke","Okay. Congrats on a great quarter. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Drew, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Jerry Revich","Hey, good afternoon.","Ward Nye","Hi, Jerry.","Anne Lloyd","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could talk about within the West Group is where you saw the most dramatic price increases. How broad-based is that, is that really across the board, any mix contribution within that?","And I guess when were the bulk of the price increases put through, and should we get a bigger tailwind in Q2 in that region?","Ward Nye","If you think back to last year we actually saw mid years in all the markets in Texas, and we came back and had price increases at the beginning of this year as well. And what I would say Jerry, I'd rather not go market-by-market through Texas, but what I'll tell is the lowest one that I'm seeing even in sub-markets is 10%, and others are obviously considerably more attractive than that.","So we're seeing good solid pricing across that entire marketplace, which again I think is indicative of continued momentum there, and a continued positive outlook. If contractors feel like they're seeing something awfully challenging coming their way, I don't think we would see that type of pricing momentum in every corner of our business in that state.","And when we're speaking to West Group, I need to pause on Colorado too. We're seeing good movement on aggregate pricing in the Colorado market. And again, part of what I believe we're going to see, Jerry, is more of a hard rock influence coming into markets north of Denver. Simply because they have alluvial plays they are playing out and again, we've got what I think is the premier hard rock position in that Denver market.","So both in Texas and Colorado, which really define in many respects the West Group on aggs, that's the story I see on pricing right now.","Jerry Revich","Thank you. And then at times you put in price increases in April 1st instead of January 1st, should we look for a bigger price increase on a year-over-year basis as a result in 2Q in the West Group, or were most price increases effective January 1?","Ward Nye","I would say the majority of them were effective January 1. Frankly some did go in April, but remember Jerry, it's not usually, particularly markets like Colorado, not a lot of aggs are moving in January.","And so I'm not sure in this instance, the timing would have made that big a difference. I just still think the overall market and the movement in pricing to me it is really moving. I'll just put it that way.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then philosophically can you talk about pricing in cement? Some folks are talking about an environmental surcharge of $5 per ton in mid-September. What are your thoughts around that topic, are you planning something similar?","Ward Nye","Well, we certainly plan to come back and look at what we feel like the price increases need to be for later in the year. I think coming back at some point and looking at another $10 a ton is not unrealistic, and I think that's the type of conversation that we're going to be having with our customers.","Obviously I feel like, Texas will continue to be a sold out market. I mean, the way that we're seeing Texas, even with bringing on some additional capacity, we talked about that before, we thought that we would come back in 2014 and add some additional capacity in that state.","We're still seeing that Texas is going to be short on domestic supply by almost 3.8 million tons. Keep in mind last year they were short on domestic supply by 3.7 million tons.","So what we're seeing is actually a tighter market in 2015 there than we saw in 2014. I think a tight market probably gives you a sense of what should happen with pricing.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Ward Nye","All right. Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Craig Bibb from CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Craig Bibb","Hi. Just one quick question. Shale aggregate volume in 2012 was 6 million tons. What was it last year?","Ward Nye","Shale aggregate volume last year was about 7.5.","Craig Bibb","I am sorry, that was shale volume was\u2026","Ward Nye","Yes, in 2012, and that's when we say we feel like it will be like this year, we think its around little over 6 million, and for the full year in 2014 pure direct shale volume was 7.4 million.","Craig Bibb","Okay. And feeling like 7.4 million on 2015 so far, but it's early?","Ward Nye","I'm sorry Craig, I missed that.","Craig Bibb","It sounded like from your comments that it's feeling like 7.4 flattish in 2015 per shale volume even with the oil uncertainty?","Ward Nye","That's what I thought I was saying, Craig. I think we'll be back close to 6 million tons.","Craig Bibb","Okay.","Ward Nye","In 2012, 6 million tons felt pretty good.","Craig Bibb","Okay. And the October $10 price increase for cement, how long did it take you to realize that?","Ward Nye","It's obviously going to vary from market-to-market, but give that a quarter to quarter and half usually.","Craig Bibb","And you realize all of it, is just takes a quarter to quarter half?","Ward Nye","It's going to take a quarter to quarter half.","Craig Bibb","Okay. If US steel production turns down does that have an impact on Magnesia Specialty?","Ward Nye","Yes, what we're seeing right now is steel the quarter running modestly over 70%. We're still seeing a very good business there. We're seeing a very good chemicals business in particular. Keep in mind US steel demand grew by 13% in 2014 to 118 million tons, compared to 105 million tons in 2013.","So with this sheer amount of par manufacturing that we're seeing, with the strength that we're seeing in our chemicals business, and with some of the customer relationships that we have, we feel very good about where we're see sitting in mag specialties.","Anne Lloyd","This is a reminder Craig, the dolomitic lime that we produce in mag specialties is the product that really most directly goes in to steel. We are actually a purchaser of dolomitic lime to supply our chemicals business.","So we do believe if there is some dislocation there, we have got room to absorb some of that in our chemicals business.","Ward Nye","Craig, the other element that's important separate and distinct from the steel is what's happening with energy there, and actually much of what we saw was natural gas prices for our kilns come down pretty considerably Q1 last year to Q1 this year.","We saw that come down about 30%, and we feel like that's going to stay at a pretty good steady number for the balance of the year.","Craig Bibb","And the last one, with Ready Mix do you have room to go ahead and take price there coincident with the cement price increase?","Ward Nye","Well again, I think that's going to be a market-by-market phenomenon, because you're going to see very different prices depending on whether you're in Denver or whether you're in Dallas or frankly even if you're in some community relatively close to Dallas, but outside of the Metroplex.","So that\u2019s going to be a sub-market by sub-market decision. But if cement is going up Ready Mix is going to go up.","Craig Bibb","Great. Thanks a lot.","Ward Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Ted Grace from Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Ted Grace","Hey guys, nice quarter.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Ted. How are you?","Ted Grace","I'm great, how are you doing?","Ward Nye","I can't complain.","Ted Grace","Good. As I typically do, Anne, could we go through a bridge on the aggregate operations? I know slide six on your deck gives a couple big pieces. But I was just wondering if we could dig into the kind of like nuances within the volume pricing, and I guess the cost side, as well, which, can we start there?","Anne Lloyd","Well, Ted if you look at slide six, we break it down between the Heritage aggregate product line, the Heritage aggregates related downstream product line, which would be the Ready Mix business and paving, and the acquired businesses. So it's all laid out for you on slide six.","Ted Grace","Could you go through what the cost factors were, that $14.3 million dynamic?","Anne Lloyd","Primarily it's because of increased production volume. As Ward indicated earlier production volume was up about 12% for the quarter. And so you've got costs, you've got costs just increasing from the sheer number of tons you're producing.","Ward Nye","The other issue that's there Ted to be clear, we did pull some maintenance or repair forward and we did have some additional stripping in the quarter, as well, because we're anticipating a heavy volume year. So we accelerated a little bit of that, we believe. But I think those probably are the primary drivers that Anne outlined.","Ted Grace","Okay. And then I guess, on a similar note to some other questions I know you have seen pricing up 29, and that gives you 10.5 points or so year-on-year, and just the way you reflected it looks like that's all true economic capture of pricing.","So I guess I come back to the question, if you flow through an extra 300 basis points, that's $30 million to $45 million of incremental EBITDA. I know there's the conservatism, but I mean, is there anything else we need to be aware of that has led to you.","I mean, just logically if you left all other aspects of your guidance unchanged as you did in the press release, and you flow through $30 million to $45 million of EBITDA, it's just hard to understand why we're keeping the numbers flat or $10 million the low end, excuse me.","Ward Nye","No, Ted, look, I hear you. I mean, the only thing I can say is its still April. And I think just changing a full year EBITDA number, on last time I checked EBITDA numbers the people thought were pretty healthy EBITDA numbers, just didn't feel right in March, April.","And as I said we can come back and revisit that here in the next quarter. But we just felt like until we had one more quarter under our belts, let's just watch this.","Ted Grace","Okay. And on the pricing data you gave us, I think in Texas you said it was up 10% or better, did I hear that correctly, to Jerry's question?","Ward Nye","Yes, what I was saying is that if I was looking across major and minor markets, I think what I was essentially saying is, I wasn't seeing anything that wasn't up at least 10%. So I was really bracketing on the lowest end, just to give you that lowest denominator.","Ted Grace","Yes, that\u2019s rappel [ph] So I guess the question is, you bought a lot of assets in Texas, there is some debate whether they were kind of effectively pricing. Can you talk about at 10%, was that kind of coming up to where the market is, was the whole market moving up at that rate?","Just it would be helpful to get some context o what that 10% was in the broader context of what the markets are doing?","Ward Nye","I guess, Ted, what I would say is you still got in most markets in Texas markets that are below our corporate average. And so what I would tell you is you're seeing higher percentage movement in the West than the East. But you continue in my view to have more room in the West to move at higher percentages.","So if I'm looking at these percentages they're very attractive. If I'm looking at the prices, they're getting candidly to what I feel like is a much more acceptable and appropriate level. But I also still believe in a number of those markets you've got a lot of room ahead of you.","Ted Grace","Sure. That's great to hear. Again, nice quarter and best of luck this future quarter.","Ward Nye","Ted, thanks so much. We'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Adam Thalhimer","Hi, good afternoon. Congrats on a strong quarter.","Ward Nye","Thanks, Adam.","Adam Thalhimer","Ward you brought up the Tx DoT spending budget for this year is $9 billion. Do you have any sense for what that looks like for next year?","Ward Nye","It's going to continue to be strong in large part, because let's think of it two different ways Adam. Number one they continue to have the billion dollars from Prop 17 profile. Let's keep in mind too, Texas is a fiscal year that ends in August, not June.","So it's different than many of our states. We've got an $8 billion or call it $9 billion budget this year that's coming on the tail of a couple of three record DoT budgets in Texas.","So what I would tell you is anybody who tells you what they think Texas is going to be next year and the year after is going to be wrong, because if we looked at Texas, and we went back two or three years and did that same look forward, we too would have been wrong. It\u2019s just consistently been better than anyone would have thought.","And part of what I find moving and what's going on in Texas right now that $1.1 billion that's already been basically dedicated for this year under Prop 1, when we come back and look at what that means it's $85 million in Austin. It's $82 million in Dallas. It's $206 million in Houston, and its $147 million in San Antonio.","So if we think back over the last several years on the part of Texas that was not getting as much infrastructure as some of the others, it was places like San Antonio that now have a toll system, and they didn't before and they're seeing a good slug from Prop 1.","So as we're looking at infrastructure in Texas right now, what our team in Texas would tell me is Ward we've got two, three or four years of good work ahead of us right now.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. Great. And then I wanted to ask about the mix between res and non-res. I think last quarter you said that you expected non-res to grow faster than res, this quarter you are saying res was a little faster than non-res,","I'm just wondering if that's because the res outlook went up, and the non-res outlook came down a little bit?","Ward Nye","Actually if you think about it our outlook is for non-res to be in the high single digits, and for res to be in double-digit growth. So I see from a growth perspective I think what we're saying in our forecast is consistent with it.","What I would tell you too is the mix of business that we have from a pure bucket perspective, would call it 45% infrastructure, 30% non-res, and 15% res is a pretty normalized percentage. They all need to be lifted up, and that's what we're seeing.","But from a pure breakdown of business geographically and end use across our company and our business, we don't feel bad with those percentages. We're just looking forward to more volume. We think more volume continues to create an enduring good pricing story.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. Thanks, Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Brent Thielman","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Ward, your optimism on Texas is crystal clear, but was curious in some of the other energy exposed regions around the country, Oklahoma, around the Marcellus, I know you don't have as much exposure there. But are you seeing any evidence of slowing construction activities or starts?","Ward Nye","No, I mean, we're not. I mean, did we see some pure slow down in pure energy that's going in some of those? Yes, we do. But again, from a pure volume perspective, Texas just so much outweighs those.","And I think the other thing that gives me some optimism about Texas, is most shale plates break even at the $50 to $60 per barrel, and $50 is I think a key threshold of pain for a lot of different areas.","Texas and what's going on in Eagle Ford, is really one of the more competitive areas. So really one of the most competitive areas with the biggest volume for us, is again we think back to the 2012 level that we view relatively attractively.","So could there be some headwinds in Niobrara? Maybe. Could there be some headwinds in Marcellus? Maybe. Do we continue to believe those are offset by other non-res activity and res? We feel very strongly that it will.","Brent Thielman","Yes. Got it. Thank you.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Brent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Betts from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mike Betts","Yes. Thank you very much. I had two or three quick questions if I could, please, Ward and Anne. First one you gave some, I think it was $11 million in Q3, and $10 million in Q4 of expected maintenance spend in cement. Could you remind me what it was last year so I've got some idea in terms of modeling?","Secondly, we have just received a Texas cement data, it was very weak in March. Could you talk \u2013 did that have any impact at all on trying to put the price increases through, because presumably people were pretty disappointed by a double-digit decline in volumes, which appears to be the case in March.","And then thirdly, could you talk about what California volumes did? I don't know if the figures for the quarter a year ago, but some idea of what the trend in terms of shipments is going on there? Thank you.","Ward Nye","Absolutely Mike. What we'll do, let's talk a little bit about what we think happens with kiln maintenance because as you outlined Mike, forecast $5.4 million, actually that is what we spent in Q1, $2 million forecast in Q2, $11.2 million in Q3, and $10.3 million in Q4.","What we had told you that we would do early in the year was around $33.3 million worth of kiln expense for the year. We think we're coming in now at $28.9 million. So it's going to be about a $4.4 million difference, as a practical matter that's just looking at the way the marketplace is moving.","I think the challenge is that you're seeing in cement in those March numbers were more weather and location driven than anything else. I do think west Texas is clearly a very different cement market than the cement markets in which we participate.","So to the extent that those are almost purely energy driven, we are not going to feel that pain. I think we come back to the notion that we discussed Mike, and that is almost under any mathematics we see, Texas is almost $4 million on domestic supply short this year. So from a pricing perspective, I think we're going to be in fine shape. That doesn't concern me.","Mike Betts","Okay. And the $11.2 million and the $10.3 million Q3 and Q4, what did that compare to last year?","Ward Nye","We were at $8.1 million in Q3 last year, and it looks like there was none in four last year, I believe those are the numbers. And then again there would have been spend in Q1 and Q2 last year, but we don't have those.","Mike Betts","Okay. And then some idea if you have what the California volumes are doing? I mean, I know you didn't own the business a year ago, but you have some idea of what they've done in the quarter roughly?","Ward Nye","Well, we feel like from a volume perspective, California volume was up 9%. So again, we're seeing good volume growth in California right now. I think that goes back to the question that Timna asked as well, relative to what are you seeing there, when do you think, what's going to happen with pricing in that market.","And that type of almost double-digit volume number up, is what gives us the continued confidence that market is on its way back to a supply demand equilibrium.","Mike Betts","Last question, what utilization rates are you now running at in California?","Ward Nye","You are Mr. Cement today, Mike. And across what we're seeing across our enterprise right now is probably something in the low to mid-80s, particularly coming out of Q1. So we're obviously looking to ramp those up as you may recall from our Investor Analyst day. We view 90% as a world class number, and our aim is to get it there.","Mike Betts","Understood. And thank you very much.","Ward Nye","All right. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for any further remarks.","Ward Nye","Danielle, thank you. And thank you all for joining our first quarter earnings call. We are excited about the first quarter trends in case you couldn't tell, and we're going to work hard to build on this momentum throughout the year. We look forward to discussing our second quarter results with you in July. Thanks for your time today, and for your continued support at Martin Marietta.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

And welcome to the Martin Marietta Q4 2014 and Full Year Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. Sir, you may begin.","Ward Nye","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining Martin Marietta's quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As announced in this morning's release, we were pleased to complete the transformation year in 2014 from Martin Marietta culminating with the 77% increase in fourth quarter net earnings over the prior year quarter. Our results reflect growth in the Heritage aggregates business, the expanding contribution from the acquired TXI operations and the consistently strong performance by our Magnesia Specialties business. Additionally, we also announced a 20 million share repurchase program on which I'll further elaborate later in the teleconference. In addition to earnings growth, we were pleased to announce positive developments related to the TXI synergies. First, we exceeded our previously announced guidance for 2014 by 53% or nearly $10 million. Second, based on our integration progress to date, we now expect to achieve annual synergies of $100 million by 2016 more than 40% over our previous guidance. This rate of synergy realization made the TXI acquisition modestly accretive to 2014 earnings excluding of course to one-time costs related to the transaction. This accretion should continue into 2015 and beyond based on incremental synergy realization coupled with continued growth in the underlying business. ","These developments confirmed our ability to deliver on our objectives and create additional shareholder value. Before further discussing the quarterly and full year results, as a reminder, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connections with future events or future operating or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter and full year earnings release and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC websites. Also, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales and exclude freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings and on our website.","To continue to provide transparency into our fourth quarter results, we will again discuss the results for the heritage business separately from those of acquired operations. To facilitate this discussion, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information that is consistent with how management analyzes the business. First, as detailed on Slide 2, the Heritage Martin Marietta business which includes Magnesia Specialties provides the same-on-same comparison to the prior fourth year quarter. Next, the results of the acquired operations by product line and in total are provided on Slide 4. And finally on Slide 7, we provide an analysis of the increase in earnings from operations. We believe this approach provides meaningful information to better understand the drivers of our performance. ","Now let's review some of the underlying trends for the Heritage business. Slide 3 provides volume and pricing metrics by product line for the Heritage aggregates business. We are pleased to report volume growth in all product lines and in all reportable groups within the aggregates product line. Additionally, pricing strength was notable in both aggregates and ready mix concrete product lines. Consistent with trends seeing through our 2014, fourth quarter aggregates business growth was led by robust activity in our West Group primarily in Texas and Colorado. Texas continues to benefit from a strong state department of transportation with the cumulative budget of $20 billion over fiscal years 2013 to 2015; Texas has created a sizable project backlog. This public work is naturally separate and distinct from a very healthy private sector in Texas. Thus all the aggregates product line shipping increase in the West Group was approximately 8.5%. The same-on-same comparison reflects growth of more than 15%. This comparison excludes shipments in the prior year quarter from the North Troy Quarry in Oklahoma and two rail yards in the Dallas area, which were divested in the third quarter of 2014. ","This transaction was actually the only required divestiture for the approval of the TXI acquisition by the United States Department of Justice in connection with its Hart-Scott-Rodino review. North Carolina, Georgia and Florida all rank in the top five states for employment growth. A catalyst for construction activity. Consistent with this trend, recovery in the construction market is underway in the Eastern half of the country although currently lagging the west. Heritage aggregates product line volumes in the mid-America group which increase to 7.7% reflects growth throughout North Carolina. The South East Group benefited from activity --increased activity in Florida with the TIFIA funded I-4 project is beginning and the housing market is also improving. ","Heritage aggregates product line shipments reflect growth in all end-use markets. The infrastructure market represented 44% of quarterly volumes and the shipments to this sector increased 12%. This growth reflects double-digit improvement in each reportable group and notably was achieved while the Federal Transportation funding is being provided under a continuing resolution through May 31. During this time, we've seen increase in momentum for a multiyear federal highway bill. The executive and congressional branches of government each recognized the need to invest in the country's aging and deficient infrastructure. Despite bipartisan support for new bill, the main area of debate continues to be the funding source. The nonresidential end use market represented 32% quarterly Heritage volumes and shipments increased 4% over the prior year quarter. Growth was achieved in the commercial and energy sectors. While declining oil prices caused concern about the sustainability of energy related projects, we don't expect the significant impact on our business based on both the backlog and the momentum of committed projects as well as $100 billion of anticipated projects along the Gulf Coast, a significant portion of which are in Texas.","Additionally, late last year Texas voters approved proposition one which authorizes annual disbursements from the state's existing oil and gas production tax collections to the state highway fund. An estimated $1.7 billion will be transferred this fiscal year alone. The residential end use market represented 15% of quarterly Heritage aggregates product line volumes and shipments increased 5% over the prior year quarter. We continue to experience significant residential construction growth in our western markets. By way of example, for the 12 months ending December 31, 2014, residential starts rose 33% in San Antonio, 10% in Houston, and 37% in Austin. This reaffirms our view of the value of the company's strategic growth initiatives made over the last several years which should continue to benefit our future demand. ","Finally to conclude the discussion of end use markets, ChemRock\/Rail represented the remaining 9% of our Heritage aggregates product line volume and shipments increasing 5% versus the prior year quarter. This growth reflects an increase in ballast shipments partially offset by a slowdown in agricultural land shipments. Heritage aggregates product line pricing remains strong and we're pleased to achieve increases in each geographic group. Pricing increased 6% over the prior year quarter led by 9% increase in the West Group.","For the full year, Heritage aggregates product line pricing increased 4% in line with our guidance. Aggregates product line cost per ton shift declined to 2% compared with the prior year quarter. The reduction reflects increased operating leverage and an 11% decline in energy costs driven by lower oil prices. The Heritage aggregates related downstream product lines increased their total gross profit $5 million. The ready mix concrete product line experienced pricing and volume increases of 11% and 2% respectively, which led to an 840 basis points in the product line gross margin. Additionally, the asphalt business reported 16% increase in its net sales. Gross profit for the Heritage aggregates business increased $27 million and was 21.7% of net sales, an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year quarter. Notably the Heritage ready mix concrete business gross margin expanded 570 points.","These are primarily the operations acquired in the Denver market at the end of 2011 which have demonstrated steady improvements since the acquisition. We expect the similar trend in the acquired TXI ready mix business. Our specialty products business posted record fourth quarter net sales of $58.2 million and a gross margin of 39% contributing earnings from operations of $19.8 million.","Slide 4 through 6 provides financial information and key metrics for our acquired operations. For the fourth quarter, the acquired aggregates product line reported net sales of nearly $31 million on shipments of 2.5 million tons. Average selling price was $12.13 per ton helped by increased rail distribution yard and sand and gravel shipments. Performance in the Aggregates business did improve at an accelerated pace given the strength of underlying market demand and synergy realization. The acquired ready mix concrete business shift 1.3 million cubic yards during the quarter at an average selling price of $82.74. ","In the South West, fourth quarter selling prices and production costs are typically lower than in the warmer months when temperature control measures are required during the production process. Such measures are passed on as additive pricing when incurred. A $6 per yard price increase was announced in the North Texas market on August 1st. For realization of the increase will likely take six months as we work through the current backlog. ","As a reminder, the cement business includes a leading position in the Texas markets and the state-of-the-art rail located cement plant in Southern California. The Texas plants continue to operate in markets where demand currently exceeds local available supply. A trend expected to continue for the near future. In the fourth quarter, we shift 1 million tons of cement. Cement pricing of $93.02 per ton is $7.07 or 8.2% higher than the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, the cement business generated $100 million of net sales and $28 million in gross profit. The Texas plants are operating between 75% and 85% utilization and the California plant is operating below 70% utilization reflective of a slower Southern California construction economy recovery.","We continue to anticipate California markets should reach the supply demand equilibrium during 2016. Our cement group leadership is implementing strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies, plant utilization at efficiency thereby creating a roadmap for significantly improved future profitability. ","Our remaining key area of emphasis is to increase and accelerate the synergistic value of the TXI acquisition. We're thus pleased to announce our revised expectations of $100 million of annual synergies by 2016. For the second half of 2014, we achieved synergies of nearly $28 million, 53% above our guidance. These results are not possible without the relentless and effective efforts of our workforce. I'm proud to thank and commend our employees for their stellar progress. We planned to complete the systems integration for the cement and ready mix concrete businesses no later than June of this year, accordingly and as planned certain duplicative corporate overhead costs will continue through that time. ","As previously announced, we acquired over $500 million of TXI's net operating loss of NOL carry forwards. We used $48 million of these benefits to reduce our cash taxes to 17% of our income tax expense. We expect to utilize the remaining NOLs over the next two to three years. For the fourth quarter, consolidated SG&A was 6.4% of net sales, a 120 basis point reduction compared with the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects both lower pension expense as well as net sales growth which outpaced the increase in SG&A. We incurred net acquisition related expense to $1.7 million which reflects our estimated quarterly run rate related TXI going forward. As detailed on Slide 7, our consolidated earnings from operations were $119 million. This compares to $63 million in the prior quarter and represents an improvement of nearly 90%. With the full year we generated $382 million of operating cash flow compared with $309 million for 2013. Importantly though excluding payments for acquisition related expenses, adjusted operating cash flow was $452 million. This increase is due to higher earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and less cash taxes partially offset by cash utilized for working capital. The ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2014, was slightly less than 2.5x in compliance with leverage covenant and in line with our target as of yearend. Our ability cash has provided us the opportunity to increase our return to shareholders in addition to the quarterly dividend. Consistent with this objective, this morning we announced a new share buyback program that includes authorization to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our common stock. To provide context to this number, this represents nearly 30% of our outstanding shares as well as the number of shares issued on our July 1, 2014 acquisition of TXI. We expect to complete the program over three years. However, the actual timing would depend on available cash and the market price for our stock during the timeframe. Our balance sheet strength has allowed us to provide this return to our shareholders while also continuing to invest in our business responsibly. ","Moving to our 2015 guidance. We anticipate growth in nearly all of our markets both geographically particularly areas with strong employment gains and construction end use. Further, we expect economic expansion in the Western United States to continue and the economic recovery in the East to accelerate. Overall, in our geographies we expect growth in our three largest end use markets. The infrastructure market is expected to increase in the mid single digits. Nonresidential construction is expected to increase in the high single digits, the residential market is expected to experience a double digit increase and the ChemRock\/Rail market is expected to remain relatively flat. Geographically, we expect aggregates product line shipments to increase 10% to 12% with a 4% to 7% growth in the heritage business and the remainder coming from a full year of owning the TXI operations. We expect aggregates product line pricing to be up 4% to 6% over 2014. Aggregates product line cost per ton ship is expected to decline slightly compared with 2014. The aggregates related downstream operations are expected to generate between $875 million and $925 million of net sales and $65 million to $70 million of gross profit. ","We expect net sales for the cement business to range from $475 million to $500 million and gross profit to be $120 million to $130 million. Magnesia Specialties net sales are expected to be between $240 million and $250 million generating a gross profit of $85 million to $90 million. SG&A expenses as percentage of net sales are expected to be less than 6%. Despite an $18 million increase heritage pension cost over 2014. On a consolidated basis we expect to generate earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense or EBITDA ranging from $825 million to $875 million. Interest should approximate $75 million to $80 million and the estimated effective income tax rate is expected to be 32% excluding discrete events. Capital expenditures are forecast to be $320 million which includes $35 million of synergy related capital and $80 million for continued development of the Medina limestone quarry outside of San Antonio. This capital project will provide a modern highly efficient rail connected quarry capable of shipping products to South Texas including Houston for generations. ","To conclude, we are grateful to our shareholders for their support throughout an exciting and transformational year. The TXI acquisition strengthened and broadens our foundation and we are well positioned to benefit from the growth demand for building materials and to continue delivering enhanced shareholder value. Additionally, for those of who you registered we look forward to seeing you at our Investor and Analysts Day this week on Thursday, February 12 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. With those of who you cannot attend, the event will be webcast and our website contains more details. Again thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta. The operator will now give the required instructions. We will turn our attention to answering your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson","Thank you for taking my questions today. First couple questions are focused on TXI and in particular for the quarter, what was the switch between Q3 and Q4 in terms of realizing the upside from TXI synergies? And to that and what inning are we in terms of cost take- out for TXI? ","Ward Nye","Kathryn, thank you for question. I guess two components in that. Number one you have to remember when we went into the transaction and closed it on July 1, because of the anti-trust process, our operating teams had really only had about a couple of weeks with that business before we closed. So from a practical matter their time on the ground and their time looking for what we signed or we turn found synergies were really pretty short. So what's happen is as you are seeing really the result of having our teams in therefore in more expanded period of time. That's what really driven the acceleration of these synergies. So I am not that surprised by it. I knew if we could get our good people on the ground they would capture those and we would see them quickly and I do think they did a fantastic job with that. To the next part of question, where we are in the innings. I think we are in the early innings of this game. I mean again we've owned this business for a little bit over half year, you are seeing that type of synergy realization that quickly. You have to assume that we as a combined work force and that's what we are now. We will continue to work very effectively to find more and I think you should expect us to find more. ","Kathryn Thompson","One other follows up question on TXI. What were the -- could remind me the total aggregate volumes for calendar 2014 and what is TXI earnings contributing to 2015 in terms of the guidance you outlined today? ","Ward Nye","I can give you exactly what they were for the -- we are looking at 3.5 million tons of TXI really for the quarter and that's stone side we are looking about 1.3 on the cement side for the quarter casually again. The full year, we had never gone back and talked about that but we have given good guidance on that going forward. ","Kathryn Thompson","Okay, perfect. In terms of the volumes related to energy, in the past you'd it was roughly 7 million tons related to the energy industry are region specifically impacted by that. How much of the volumes two tiers one, what do you think now in terms of trends you alluded to that in your prepared commentary and then the second half is how much of this volumes are more related to directly to the energy industry so for instance building out a pad versus in the other type of construction projects which might be, for instance, building on road in a region that would be building road anyway but happens to be in the oil patch?","Ward Nye","Understood. Here what we saw energy in the fourth quarter, give you sense, we saw fourth quarter sale volumes about 1.7 million tons that was down about 350,000 tons for the quarter. We saw pull back in the Eagle Ford oddly enough or maybe not oddly enough, we saw Haynesville will actually up so what you are seeing is a little bit of play on gas versus gas and oil, Kathryn. If you go back and look at full year is around 7.5 million tons, you just been dead on that, most of that is going to either roads or pass or otherwise but here is the take that we have on it. What are seeing is a strong enough recovery in other areas of nonres that we think that's going to offset whatever bumps there maybe in some elements of the products simply going to the different shale place. So from where we are sitting, the shale play has always been in nonres all by itself. We are just seeing other portions of it. They are growing so rapidly. We think it is likely to offset that. But the other piece of it Kathryn now I that think it is important is the way energy has been moving particularly in the state like Texas to put some metrics to it. We used -- I want to say 17 million gallons of diesel fuel in the South West last year, so as we are watching oil prices come down, can it affect some degree of volume going to shale fields? The answer is yes. Do I think it is going to be horribly dramatic? The answer to that is no. Do I think the cost benefit that we will likely to see from that is much better than the downside on the volume? The answer to that is absolutely. ","Kathryn Thompson","And last question. Touching on lower diesel, what was the benefit in the quarter if you can quantify that? ","Ward Nye","Kathryn, it was round $4 million for the quarter. To give you a sense of what run rate is looking like in Q3 we burned about 11.5 million gallons of diesel fuel. In Q4 about 10.4 and that goes back to heritage numbers. Q1 we were 6.4 and Q2 we were 8.5. So we are looking at a run rate for this combined Martin Marietta at our TXI business, we are probably in that 40 to 44 million gallons of diesel per year. That's not a bad way to think about it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Tray Groom with Stephens Inc. Your line is open.","Tray Groom","Hey, good afternoon, Ward Nye. I am doing well, how about yourself? Good, so just kind of follow up on that, on the last question about energy. So if you look at your Texas business overall, what is the mix -- is the mix of Texas any different than the mix that you have for your overall company that outlined here?","Ward Nye","No. It is not dramatically different. And the one thing that I would say that I think we need to think about is they have got a record letting program in Texas this year tries to the simple fact is if you look at a record infrastructure letting program this year close to $10 billion. And then doesn't include lot of the P3 work that's going on in that state. From an infrastructure perspective it is simply getting larger and keep in mind even the energy cargo road work that started last year about $150 million worth of that work was let but Texas I'd tell you they got $1 billion issue, they are all by themselves, so my point is thus more and more of that work probably for the next two, three years at least in Texas will tend to be infrastructure driven simply because that market is so immense right now. ","Tray Groom","And so the comment that you made about seeing some areas of nonres, seeing them those areas grow rapidly in your expectations for those to offset any slowdown you would see in the energy related demand. Can you talk more specifically about your -- what are you seeing, where are you seeing those that rapid improvement? ","Ward Nye","Here is a quick way to think of it. It continues in some respect to be highly concentrated in Texas because if you are looking at nonresidential start, so these are projects that aren't completed, these are projects that are underway and starting. The change from 2013 to 2014 was nearly $17 billion. So you just got an enormous amount of activity in that market place that's moving in that fashion. At the same time when we come back and take a look at more traditional commercial. In other words what's going on in office? What's going on in retail, what's going in shopping centers? What we are seeing right now Tray is considerably more work in that space and we've seen over the last several years. But you will remember we have seen a lot of heavy work in nonres over last two three years but not a lot on the lighter side of commercial, now we are starting to see that turn. But we are also starting to see that turn in other states is important to us. South Carolina, up 14%, Colorado up 17%, so again very good nonres activity across the board.","Tray Groom","Okay, thanks for that, Ward. And then shifting gears on the share repurchase program. Are you guys expecting to fund the majority of that or all of it or I guess how much of it with free cash flow versus -- are you thinking you may need to lever up some and bring on some debt to fund the buyback? ","Ward Nye","I will take the first part and let Anne come back and give some color to that. But our view is we can do this using our excess free cash flow. So we can go through this, we can take care of the requirements of the business. We can take care of the requirements of the dividend. And as we come down to that targeted range of between 2 and 2.5 and as you heard in my opening remarks, we are now below 2.5. As we get towards that 2 range, Tray, if our projections are right the free cash flow or excess free cash flow to this business is going to kick off, is pretty considerable. And I think that's something that we had a lot of conversation about it. But Anne you want to add some color to that. ","Anne Lloyd","Yes. I mean I think the free cash flow alone could fund the program. Our view however that is you can preserve your leverage as your acquisition firepower, we think today that our ton of leverage is $850 million that can do some pretty good M&A activity funding. So we would target that kind of two times leverage is all of our excess cash flow, similar to capital priorities are there. And preserve our firepower for financial flexibility. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois","Hi, thank you. And congratulation. First question I guess is the follow up to the free cash flow generation that you are expecting over the next several years. Could you maybe talk about the CapEx requirements that you anticipate over the next call two to three years? You identified a large project that you are putting into the budget for 2015. Does that go into 2016 and 2017 or how should we think about CapEx I guess when we are footing that against some pretty strong free cash flow potential? ","Ward Nye","Let's do this. Let me come back and talk about capital spending for this year, Anne will come back and talk a little bit more about CapEx in the out years. I mean if we are looking at $320 million for this year really the way that we are looking that's probably around 184 is an aggregate we are seeing probably around $40 million in cement, as I mentioned in my comments around $35 million on synergy, around $28 million in ready mix concrete and then of course we are buying land and otherwise. Back to your very specific question the Medina quarry project that we have outside of San Antonio, we are looking to put about $80 million into that this year. And we expect that project to be substantially complete this year. So we expect the term to switch and have that process very much underway as we go into 2016.","Anne Lloyd","And the total spends on that Medina project is about $150 million. So we've already acquired the property and done initial work there. As we look at 2016 and beyond from a capital allocation perspective, we could have placed holder in our forecasting of about $350 million annually for the combined business. If you can look back over the pattern of our capital spending, Garik, we generally are counter cyclical. When the markets are rising, recovery is rising, we generally are investing in Martin Marietta, expanding capacity, upgrading facilities. And then generally we do most of our M&A activity as the markets down. ","Ward Nye","Garik, one thing remember there -- as you remember when we are really spending at a maintenance level, at that point we are looking at DD&A numbers closer to 175 to 180 and we are looking at DD&A numbers today closer to 70 just to put some scope to that. ","Garik Shmois","Okay, thanks for the color. I guess switching to cement and cement pricing. You saw a nice sequential increase in the second quarter of ownership of the TXI assets. Just wondering if you can help parse out how much of the sequential price increase was just a low price to legacy projects rolling off so you had favorable project mix as opposed to organic price increases that we are putting in the market throughout the course of calendar 2014?","Ward Nye","Garik, it is tough to parse much of that I can tell you. Obviously the order projects are rolling up now with pretty quick rapidity. Obviously, we came in and put a $10 a ton increase in that market. And Texas is sold out market. And we are going to do more of same and we made that clear to our customers. And we are in very good places in that market place. So I would say the order prices are rolling off and what you are seeing going forward should be just true real sequential movement. ","Garik Shmois","Got it, thank you. And then my last question is respect to your cost guidance. You provided some of the sensitivities around diesel in your consumption. But unit cost guidance is for small decline, just wondering how much of the potential diesel benefits you do have embedded in your formal guidance for a cost in 2015? ","Anne Lloyd","Garik, we have included I would say about $20 million of embedded diesel improvement in our forecast and we actually -- you think about when we do our planning, we do our planning in the October timeframe, so we are going to use energy prices as of that time, so there has been obviously a rapid decline from that point in time to the end of 2014 but we've kept that diesel price in our plan with all but about $20 million of that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman & Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good afternoon. I am doing well, thanks. How are you? I am wondering if you could talk about which chemicals and LNG projects are within your target markets in Texas and maybe you could outline which of them are via truck versus rail, just help us understanding how you are positioned on those.","Ward Nye","I'd tell you what; I don't want to talk specific project by project. What I can tell you is if we are looking in South Texas, there are four major energy projects, is one major DOT project and if I just look at those all by themselves I can see the prospect of 2.5 million tons of aggregates on those. If we look at Houston, I can see a 11 different projects there with well over 2 million tons required, Houston road project separate and distinct from those other private projects, six major road projects over 4 million tons on those. And then back to the conversation we were having around infrastructure and specifically what's going on in North Texas. We are looking at projects in Dallas and Fort Worth in North Texas; they will call for almost 9 million tons of aggregates. So these are big projects all over the state, big tonnage and it makes us feel awfully good about where we are. ","Jerry Revich","And how long are the infrastructure projects I guess we are hearing from some of the REITs around Texas that new activity for them in 2016 will slow and I am wondering do you have enough visibility on the public side to really drive growth into 2016 or for 2016 at least based on what you see even if the private side slows? ","Ward Nye","All right. If I am looking on I-65 and 69 in Houston just starting to supply the project on US- 290 in Houston just starting to supply the project on state highway 288 in Houston, we are just starting to take bids on the Grand Parkway on another leg of it will be coming out again in May. So a lot of these projects, Jerry that I am talking about are projects that have multiple years ahead of them. And they are just starting. So I am not really speaking to jobs that I feel like to be going away in near terms. These are jobs that have likes to them. ","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then I am wondering if you could just talk about the pricing actions in cement and aggregates, and I believe you are planning a significant increase in January 1 for aggregates in Texas and then maybe you can comment on when --did you notify customers about next price increase in Texas, cement I think the general market expectation is for another round of increase around margin, I am wondering is that consistent with your schedule. ","Ward Nye","I mean that's the conversation we certainly going to having with customers. Again going back to the conversation we had a minute ago, these are markets they are in large part sold out. And DFW in particular to market that showed on sand and market that's long on really big projects. So we will certainly continue to push price along in these markets simply because of where they are. And the effect that this would which we can supply them. ","Jerry Revich","And would you care to comment on the magnitude of that price increase in aggregate in cement? ","Ward Nye","Yes. In cement, we are looking another 10 bucks a ton in the Dallas and in Texas markets. And in aggregates in that market place, we came back at a mid year price increase and Dallas we worked last year, we are coming into this year, it is going to vary by product but you could be looking anywhere from on the low end of $0.50 a ton to a high end of close to a ton to a couple of bucks a ton.","Jerry Revich","And then in terms of just a path to get to full utilization in the Texas cement operation. I guess based on the bookings in hand, do you anticipate you will be at full production rate in 2015? Can you just give small color there please? ","Ward Nye","I think we will continue to drive full production rate. Here is what full production rate is going to look like for us, Jerry. We are looking to be at 7 million tons by 2017, so here is the way that I would think about it. We are going to look in 2015 to add probably 250,000 tons in Texas that should be about 200,000 tons at Hunter, and 50,000 at Midlothian, in 2016 looking to come back and add another 300,000 tons probably about 140 at Hunter, ",", 160 at Midlothian and by 2017 looking to add another probably 250,000 tons in Texas. That's going to give you bridge to what we say is 7 in 2017.","Anne Lloyd","And Jerry this is a reminder. You don't just get those efficiencies at a drop of a hat. You have to work through them as you go through planned outages at the various plants and facilities.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And maybe you could just say a bit more on that last point just calibrate us on how we should think about seasonality and for the cement business 2015 versus 2014, you had a very good fourth quarter despite the maintenance work and you just help us understand which are the seasonally weaker versus stronger quarters in 2015 since the TXI reporting was a bit off schedule from yours? ","Ward Nye","It is really going to be more driven plans when the outages are. So if you look at total outages in 2014 we had about $30.5 million spent at the cement operations in 2014. I think you should expect similar cost call it little bit north of $31 million in 2015. So what we are looking at is in Q2 and Q4, we are probably looking at nature outages in Q1 and Q3, we are looking at smaller outages. So the way that I would say major outage defined that is something that's in the zip code of plus $4 million and small outage somewhere being between $1 million and $2 million. ","Anne Lloyd","Yes. If you look at in the $30 million number that we gave you for 2014 was obviously annualized. We didn't incur $30 million in the second half 2014. So the TXI business had $30 million at calendar 2014 outages expect $31 million in 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Hughes, SunTrust. Your line is open.","Keith Hughes","Thank you. You might address this in couple days at the Analysts Day but I was intrigued with your question of using cash flow to fund this repurchase program. If that something you are going to cover, I am not going to make you go over the numbers on the call, but generally how are you going to get there? I'm having a hard time with the math.","Anne Lloyd","Well, I mean I don't have your model in front of me but just based on our view of the cash flow projections of the business, you got to take into consideration the minimal cash taxes that we will be paying over the next two years. We believe that there will be sufficient excess free cash flow to generate the $1 billion to $2 billion over the next three years that we would need to execute against this repurchase. So we can talk more about detailed.","Ward Nye","Keith, remember the other piece of that as well. We did identify excess properties at TXI. ","Anne Lloyd","Good point.","Ward Nye","And as we come through and sold those excess properties too that will play into this. ","Keith Hughes","Okay. Do you have an estimate amount what those are going to be?","Ward Nye","We talked about them at the time of transaction that would be $100 million plus minus.","Keith Hughes","So that as a change, you give as change. ","Ward Nye","Correct. ","Keith Hughes","Okay. Second question when you got some very bullish nonresidential discussion here we talk about one about Gulf Coast and Texas construction, is there any other areas in nonresidential that you feel be improving in 2015 versus what it is on 2014? ","Ward Nye","I think what we are seeing is we are seeing across the enterprise now Keith because what's happened and you have seen it too in Atlanta and other markets, that's going to tend to follow housing with a lag. And in markets that you are seeing good employment dynamics and now you got North Carolina and Georgia and Florida all with good employment dynamics, all with much better housing dynamics and now what we are seeing is we are seeing the change on nonres moving in those states exactly as we would have anticipated. So we continue to see strong momentum and growth in markets like Texas. Good momentum and growth in markets like Colorado, increasing momentum and better growth in markets like Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Florida. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace with Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Ted Grace","Hi, it is Ted, congratulation on a very impressive quarter. I was hoping just talk about kind of the 2015 EBITDA guidance. So they really focused on the quarter aggregates business. Anne or Ward, can you just walk through kind of how you would encourage people to think about the flow through rate just for the aggregates business and maybe you help dimensionalize with diesel dynamics that will be -- from the standpoint of kind of when we normally think about call it 50% to 60% flow through rates for the core business ex pricing, and you said that over normalized, you never said that that's kind of target given here but could you just give us a little hand holding kind of either how people should be thinking about 2015 and to work the key variable that get you between 825 and 875, is that volume depended more than anything, is the synergy dependent more than anything just to the degree you can kind of flesh that out that will be great. ","Ward Nye","But the primary thing I think some of that is I think synergy certainly helps with that. I think the more powerful element of that really is when you are coming back and you are starting to see the Eastern United States perform a little better. I mean here is the way that you can think about it. We actually for the full year in the Mid - Atlantic division so less tonnage in 2014 than we sold in 2013. Now we are seeing then market get much stronger going into 2015, we made more money in Mid Atlantic on last tonnage in 2014 than we did 2013. So our point is simply this with that type of volume momentum now in those markets and with that type of performance in those markets, we feel like that could be awfully powerful to this business. And again what we are seeing particularly in North Texas around infrastructure, we think it is a great story. And again to your point, we are seeing lower occupancy rates in nonres than we've seen in Dallas in close to a decade right now. So when we look at what's going on sold out cement market, what we can do it pricing in that market but to your point what we can do in aggregates with synergies in TXI and an emerging strength in the South East and the Mid Atlantic group is performing more strongly, that's the key to it. That's the part of the country as you know Ted that has been the slowest to come out of this. And that's the part of the country that's the most disproportionately profitable for us particularly in heritage aggregates when it is performing in the more normalized way. ","Anne Lloyd","And if we look at the kind of booking of 825, 875, Ted, I mean obviously where our energy costs wanes for the course of the year, if energy costs were the same exactly as they were at the end of 2014 throughout the course of 2015, that 275 number pretty easily achievable. Pricing up or down one way or other and then really it back to Ward's point, it is improvement that we began to see in the back half of the year in that Southern lower right quartile of the United States. If that continues I think you can see a strong recovery in that EBITDA line. ","Ted Grace","Would you be willing to kind of state --","Anne Lloyd","But I will point, I would point out Ted if you don't mind, one of the challenges I believe that we are going to have as we move through the course of 2015 is the fact that our integration of TXI is progressing very smoothly to the point where it is becoming difficult to discern one operation from the other. ","Anne Lloyd","Which is the way it should be.","Anne Lloyd","Which is the way it should be. So parse now where those synergies are, they are there and you can see them in the results so whether they are coming from the fact that we are using a TXI Bridgeport Quarry or the Martin Marietta Chico Quarry, it is getting tougher and tougher to tell because these operations are becoming more and more seamless. ","Ted Grace","That makes sense. Would you be willing to plant a flag stake kind of like just to give us a mid point this is flow through rate on the aggregate business people should use? ","Anne Lloyd","No. ","Ted Grace","No, okay. Fair enough ","Anne Lloyd","I have got one Ted but that's your job.","Ted Grace","True, true. So my second question would be just following up on a couple others and then we are the second highest estimates on The Street and I understand and appreciate kind of the tax shield related to NOL but cumulatively we had you generating like $1 billion something cash over the next three years which based on your comments sounds too low, I know you talked about $1 billion to $2 billion of free cash but you are talking about kind of $135 of $2.7 billion of buyback. So I think that's what we are trying to struggle with that math, so I guess the question is are you actually implicitly telling us that the mid point, you said $1 billion to $2 billion of free cash is really more like $2.5 billion is what you are thinking of generating? If you can something organically or is that include cost of sales beyond the $100 million and I mean all granted you were to sell that or lever I guess that's what kind of I think people are trying to square up today is you are talking about find back $2.7 billion of stock at today's market price and we outlined is not free cash number that is even close to 2,000 so can you just talk about that little bit more to help us understand it. ","Anne Lloyd","Ted when we do our evaluation of $1 billion to $2 billion of share buyback, if you recall I mean this stock price came happened today so $133 mark got yesterday, right. So we look at $1 billion to $2 billion buyback that we thought could generate that cash flow and at the market price before today that very easily got 20 million shares, right. But obviously we will reassess and evaluate. We have said that it is excess free cash flow that we would generate from the business after organic capital and dividends; we will add back any proceeds from non strategic non operating asset sales through TXI. And that would be what we would deploy for share repurchases. ","Ted Grace","Okay, maybe I was really slow to that but just to be clear, when you are saying when you set the goal of $1 billion to $2 billion that back into like a million share count number to lower stock price. ","Anne Lloyd","I don't know how to answer your question, Ted. I am sorry. But as we look at the free cash flow available for the business that we thought we would generate it would be $1 billion to $2 billion. And that is -- what we have believe that we could allocate to share repurchases over the next two to three years. ","Ted Grace","Well, thanks, I think that's what we are trying to understand. So thank you for that clarity. Good luck. Looking forward to seeing you this week, guys ","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with DA ","Davidson. Your line is open.","Brent Thielman","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Well just back on the quarter the 12% increase from the infrastructure end market in Q4, was the majority of that from Texas or is it kind of evenly distributed among kind of Colorado, Florida and some other markets that you talked about. ","Ward Nye","It was relatively evenly distributed. I mean here is what we got. If you are looking in North Carolina, I mean we are seeing some good projects that are underway and some good projects that are coming. I mean in particular we are seeing some work coming up on Charlotte and work coming up in Greensboro, but again we saw better infrastructure work in North Carolina than we are seeing for a while. Georgia, remember as you well know the T plus program has put $1.8 billion over 10 years since South Georgia primarily, so now that's starting to pull through a degree. The Florida program as you referenced is really very, very strong. I mean it is the largest DOT budget in that state's history. One thing that's important about the state like Florida and I think it is a good model for the rest of the country, less than 30% of their DOT money actually originates from federal coffers which gives that nice staying power all the way through. And of course Colorado as we discussed has a good DOT program supplemented by their rep program, supplemented by a lot of FEMA spending in that marketplace right now. So you've got a series of markets in addition to what's going in Texas that have actually done quite well as you recall when we actually gave guidance last year the same time for 2014, we anticipated that infrastructure would be up and I think really a lot of people has some skepticism about it at the time and we said, where you are really matters on this DOT programs, and that's exactly what happen in 2014, that's what we think is going to happen in 2015 as well. ","Brent Thielman","And on that, so can we look at your kind of mid single digit assumption for infrastructure for 2015 is kind of a base level and then depending on some of these larger projects there maybe upside or timing of these large projects? ","Ward Nye","I think depending on the time of these large projects I think that is probably the case. And the other thing that I would tell you is that we can come through with a multiyear highway bill. I think in some respect that could change everything. Remember, we've been doing this in many respects moving hand to mouth on a DOT program for the better part of a decade. We haven't had a clear run on multiyear bill, and if we get a multiyear bill then I think you are clearly looking at something that we put out that's very, very safe number. And it would likely be popped up and part of what I am encouraged by is right now for you got members of the tea party like Rand Paul looking hard to find way to put a multiyear bill out there, I think that gives us a pretty good sense of where the year maybe going. ","Brent Thielman","Sure, that's interesting. If I just annualize kind of the cement gross profit business this last quarter, I mean you are kind nearing the low end of your 2015 guidance for that segment already. And clearly had some positive near term drivers in front of you for that business. I just wanted to be sure there isn't any sort of unusual expenses or other things we should consider as we are thinking about that for 2015?","Anne Lloyd","Hi, Brent, as you analyzed that you need to consider the fact that in that quarter there were about $10 million of outage cost that would only replicate likely in two of the four quarter in 2015. ","Brent Thielman","Okay ","Anne Lloyd","And that was back to the comment that I gave for Jerry and that was really if you are looking -- you should expect old and summer costs on outages but in 2015 you should look forward Q4 and Q2 to have some major outages in Q1 and Q3 to have smaller outages. Does that help? ","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Bibb with CJS Securities ","Craig Bibb","Good to be with you on the phone. Could you -- your estimate of Texas industry synergy is now 40% above your initial estimate. Can you able to breakdown the $100 million in savings you expect now? ","Ward Nye","I think the primary things that are happening SG&A numbers haven't changed. What's gotten more robust procurement is gotten more robust, operation is gotten more robust. So those primary areas that you would imagine. If you would think about in these terms the two big quarries that we picked up, the Bridgeport that is literally next door to our Chico operation. And their Mill Creek operation and cleverly our Mill Creek operation delivering next door to each other. Those now operates a single quarry and the efficiencies that we are getting from that operationally and otherwise are very significant in addition to procurement. So basically the markers that we put down on SG&A and otherwise that we knew we would be getting, they done exactly as we would have thought, the operation side of it has come through better, is come through faster. ","Craig Bibb","The planned buyback sizable, you gave in -- given some guidance in terms of maintaining your debt to EBITDA, but you are buying back a lot of stock. Do you have a goals kind of across the three years of the planned buyback, are you think in terms of 2% a quarter or any broad strokes of --where you would like to climb up -- ","Ward Nye","We will give you a good readout of it on a quarter by quarter basis. A lot of it is going to depend on how the end line business is performing. A lot of it is going to depend on what opportunities are out there as well because the primary thing that we want to make sure we do is create value and buying share back creates value. Doing the right transaction creates value as well. So it may not be a perfectly linear buyback you should expect it to be. But we will come back and we will tell you quarterly what it looks like.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Ward Nye for any closing remarks. ","Ward Nye","Again thanks for joining our fourth quarter and full year earnings call. We remain committed to what we like to call our pillars of shareholder value, world class safety, ethical conduct, sustainability, operational excellence, and cost discipline and customer satisfaction. We look forward to discussing these and other highlights with you in our first quarter results in April. See you then. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.","Suzanne Osberg","Good morning and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. With me today are Howard Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. To facilitate today's call, we have made available during this webcast and on the Investor Relations section of our website, 2019 supplemental information, that summarizes our financial results and trends.","As detailed on Slide 2, this conference call may include forward-looking statements as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in today's earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on both our own and the SEC websites.","Unless otherwise noted, all financial and operating results discussed today are for the full year 2019, any comparisons are versus the prior year. Furthermore, non-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our 2019 supplemental information and SEC filings. We will begin today's earnings call with Howard Nye, who initially will discuss our full year operating performance. Jim Nickolas will then review our 2019 financial results after which Howard will discuss market trends and 2020 expectations. A question-and-answer session will follow.","I will now turn the call over to Howard.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today's teleconference. Martin Marietta marked 25 years as a public company in 2019. Throughout our history we positioned our business to outperform through the disciplined execution of a proven strategy and our team shared commitment to the world-class attributes of our business including safety, ethics, cost discipline and operational excellence. Today's reported results clearly validate the importance of these strategic priorities. As Suzanne noted today's discussion will appropriately focus on full-year results. However, as you read in our earnings release, we reported a much improved year-over-year fourth quarter that kept off a 12-month period of record-setting financial performance.","In 2019 we once again established new records for revenues, profits and adjusted EBITDA from improved shipments, pricing and cost management across most of our building materials business. For the year consolidated total revenues increased 12% to $4.7 billion. Consolidated gross profit increased 22% to $1.2 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation depletion and amortization or adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to nearly $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share was $9.74 a 31% improvement.","Our 2019 results marked the eighth consecutive year of growth in these financial metrics. Martin Marietta's ability to repeatedly translate revenue growth into increased profitability has been and continues to be a differentiator. Our strong earnings growth drove a total shareholder return of 64% in 2019 more than double the S&P 500 and strong outperformance relative to most of our sector.","For those who have long followed Martin Marietta, our passion is operating our business safely. Safety is the core principle and the foundation of our strong financial performance. We're proud to have achieved world-class lost time instant rate levels company-wide for the third consecutive year.","Additionally, we've meaningfully improved safety performance at our legacy Bluegrass Materials operations acquired in 2018; our company's second largest acquisition. From the boardroom to site operations our teams have embraced our guardian angel and wingman branded safety culture. This continued commitment has elevated safety awareness across the company reducing downtime from workplace incidents and leading to higher revenues and profitability. Most importantly working safely protects our employees and the more than 400 communities in which we live and work.","Now let's take a deeper dive into the full-year operating performance for each of our product offerings. Aggregate shipments increased at 12% to 191 million tons exceeding our original 2019 guidance for volume growth of 6% to 8%. These shipment levels benefited from solid underlying product demand together with carryover work from an extraordinarily wet 2018. Notably for the first time in four years aggregate shipments to all three primary induced markets increased reflecting improved strength in public and private sector spending in our markets. Aggregate pricing improved 4% in line with our expectations. Importantly all divisions contributed to this solid growth. A testament to the strength of our markets and the disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy. We expect these dynamics combined with recent positive industry trends to support ongoing pricing momentum.","Our cement operations established new four-year records for volumes and gross profits. Shipments increased 10% to nearly 3.9 million tons driven by robust Texas demand, 2018 weather deferred projects and an expanded distribution terminal footprint. Cement pricing improved 3% consistent with our expectations. We expect our cement operations will continue to benefit from tight supply and healthy demand in Texas supported by growing customer backlogs and our April 2020 price increases.","Now turning to our downstream businesses despite solid fourth quarter volume improvement our full-year ready mix concrete shipments decreased 2%. Our Southwest and Rocky Mountain divisions were unable to completely overcome weather challenges that intermittently hindered construction activities throughout the year.","Average selling price increased modestly with solid gains in Colorado partly offset by a strategic customer segmentation that limited pricing improvements in Texas. Our Colorado asphalt and paving business enjoyed strong customer backlogs; a notable portion of which had been deferred into 2020. That said shipments and pricing improves 7.5% and nearly 4% respectively.","And I'll turn the call over to Jim to discuss more specifically our full-year financial results. Jim?","Jim Nickolas","Thank you Howard. The building materials business achieved record products and services revenues of $4.2 billion a 12% increase and record product gross profit of $1.1 billion a 26% increase. Full year aggregates product gross margin increased 360 basis points to 29.3% driven by pricing gains and improved operating leverage from increased shipment and production levels.","We also benefited from the actions of the negative impact from selling acquired inventory or written by acquisition accounting in 2018 as part of the Bluegrass transaction.","However, following months of robust shipment levels we incurred higher late year costs for contract services, repairs and supplies to better prepare ourselves for future production needs. These costs negatively impacted our incremental margin as did the disproportionately strong growth in long-haul distribution revenues which have a lower margin and local or truck served [quarry] revenues.","While our revenues grew at roughly double the rate of quarry revenues I'm pleased to report that gross profit per ton increased for both the long-haul and local quarry operations. Our cement operations established all-time records for product revenues and gross profit.","Product revenues increased 13% to $439 million driven by volume and pricing growth. Notably, gross profit increased 14% to $143 million even after accelerating $6 million of planned maintenance outage activities at our Hunters cement plant during the fourth quarter 2019.","Revenue growth coupled with production efficiencies from increased shipment and production levels more than offset the higher maintenance costs as product gross margin improved 20 basis points to 32.7%. Product revenues for the ready mix concrete business decreased less than 2%. Despite lower revenues gross margin expanded 60 basis points reflecting the benefits of our 2018 restructuring of the company's Southwest ready mix concrete business.","Magnesia Specialties product revenues decreased 7% to $250 million as chemicals and lime customers reduced inventory levels to line with a slowing demand trends experienced during the back half of the year. Our lime business was negatively impacted by the General Motors work stoppages in September and October as steel manufacturers pull back on demand the fluxing agent products we provide. We anticipate these current trends to be short-term in nature.","Impressively, product gross margin actually improved 150 basis points to 39.8% as the business pro-actively responded with effective cost control measures. We ended 2019 with a strongest cash generation in our history. Operating cash flow of $966 million increased 37% over 2018 driven by double-digit earnings growth and lower contributions to our already well-funded qualified defined benefit pension plan. Martin Marietta continues to balance its long-standing discipline capital allocation priorities to further enhance shareholder value and maintain financial flexibility.","Our priorities remain value enhancing acquisitions, prudent organic capital investment and the opportunistic return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases all while maintaining our investment grade credit rating profile.","In 2019, we deployed $394 million of capital into our business and returned $228 million to shareholders through both an increased dividend and the repurchase of 416,000 shares of our common stock. Since the announcement our share repurchase program in February 2015 we've returned more than $1.6 billion to shareholders while at the same time growing our business profitably and responsibly. We also reduced debt by $350 million in 2019. Strong earnings growth and higher debt repayments allowed the company to return as we said we would to our target leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5 times.","With that I will turn the call back to Howard to discuss our 2020 outlook.","Howard Nye","Thanks Jim. We are excited to build on our momentum 2020 and beyond by capitalizing on attractive fundamentals that support sustainable and long term construction growth. This underscores the importance of the notion we have long articulated where [you are] matters. We have thoughtfully executed on our strategic analysis and operating review known internally as [SOR] to position our business through aggregate\/expansion in high growth mega regions. These mega regions exhibit attractive market fundamentals including population growth, business and employment diversity and superior state fiscal position.","Notably, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida will account for nearly half of our nation's population growth between now and 2040. That's a staggering statistics in four of our top ten states by revenue. These states are experiencing and will likely continue to experience a significant influx of people requiring homes, schools, offices, restaurants, and roads. In short, population growth would drive increased construction, heavy side building materials in key Martin Marietta served markets for the next two decades.","With that in mind we are confident that construction activity in our top ten states will continue to outpace growth nationwide. The combination of strong infrastructure funding levels and healthy private sector activity is expected to drive both increased shipments and better pricing resulting in record profitability for our company in 2020.","The infrastructure market is our most aggregate-intensive venues but represented only 35% of our aggregate shipments in 2019 well below the company's most recent 10 year average of 45%. In 2020 we anticipate infrastructure shipments to meaningfully grow driven by lettings and contract awards in our key geographies, strong state and federal funding levels and proposed regulatory reforms that if approved will reduce the permitting burden of large transportation projects.","States continue to play an expanded role in infrastructure investment which bodes well for Martin Marietta as we have intentionally positioned our business in states with superior departmental transportation programs.","In Texas our largest state by revenues the DOT expects nearly $22 billion of construction contracts to fiscal year 2021 as part of its 10 year $77 billion unified transportation program. Construction growth in Texas will benefit further from large scale design build projects in and around Dallas, Fort Worth.","North Carolina the third largest state by revenues has an attractive overall fiscal position. In fact, the state's treasury is very well funded in 2020 as tax collections continue to exceed projections. That said we anticipate modest but transitory headwinds in road maintaining spending due the first half of 2020 as North Carolina DOT works through some temporary cash flow issues.","More broadly we expect incremental funding at the state and local levels to continue expanding at fast and near term rates than federal funding which will lead to additional growth opportunities for our company. Voters approved 89% of state and local transportation initiatives of the November 2019 ballot providing nearly $10 billion of targeted transportation funding across the nation. Of this total 80% was approved for transportation initiatives in our key states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina and Georgia.","Rebuilding our nation's infrastructure remains a national strategic priority. When the [indiscernible] enjoyed by partition support in Washington. We expected an enactment of a comprehensive federal infrastructure package to our place for fixing America's Service Transportation Act or FAST Act will drive multi-year infrastructure growth. Notable progress is being made on this front. In July 2019 The Senate Environment and Public Works issued America's Transportation Infrastructure Act, a Draft Highway Authorization Bill.","The draft proposes $287 billion in Federal Highway Funding over the next five years, a 28% increase over previous authorizations funding levels. Also in late January the house committee on transportation and infrastructure unveiled the moving forward framework which includes $390 billion over five years for federal highway spending, a 41% increase. The president had last week stated the union address endorsed the Senate's Bill urging Congress to pass infrastructure legislation. Legislative emphasis will now turn towards assuring a sustainable funding mechanism and we're optimistic one will ultimately be agreed upon.","Nonetheless, we're entering 2020 with perspective that a successor bill is unlikely to be passed before the November 2020 election. However, we fully expect congressional continuing resolutions to maintain federal transportation funding at a minimum at status quo levels for any interim period following the FAST Act September 2020 expiration.","We're confident that states have the necessary visibility and resources to advance planned and future construction projects particularly in our key states which tend to be less dependent on federal support for highway projects.","Non-residential shipments which accounted for 36% of our 2019 aggregate shipments are at higher levels on a percentage basis than we have historically experienced. Nonetheless, we expect another year of healthy commercial activity in 2020 supported by projects for data centers, warehouses, distribution centers and corporate relocations. Remember we have purposefully positioned our business along major interstate growth orders where land is readily available for the construction of these fulfillment and data centers.","Additionally, the recent upward movements in the architectural buildings and dodge momentum indices support a sustainable commercial construction outlook. Within the industrial sector heavy building materials consumption should benefit from the incoming wave of large energy sector projects over the next several years particularly along the Texas Gulf Coast. Construction activity on 4 projects is expected to begin in earnest in 2020 and continue for several years thereafter. Martin Marietta is well-positioned to supply the aggregates, cement and readiness concrete needs for these multi-year energy projects.","Residential construction represented 22% of our 2019 aggregate shipments while this end use is outperformed relative to the overall construction market. We expect continued gains across our leading southeastern and southwestern geographic footprint. Permit growth which in our view is the best indicator of future housing construction activity for Martin Marietta continues to be solid for single-family and multi-family housing units in our top 10 states. Keep in mind multifamily construction generally begins early in an economic cycle and then transitions to more aggregates intensive single-family construction. Healthy multifamily bodes well for continued residential growth across our footprint.","Even more compelling as previously mentioned Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida four of our top 10 states will account for nearly 50% of the country's total population growth over the next two decades as people migrate to areas with attractive employment opportunities, land availability and overall business and tax friendly environments. Importantly, notable population growth drives increased housing demand which also supports future non-residential and infrastructure activity.","In summary, we expect aggregate shipments to increase 2% to 4% in 2020 reflecting growth in all three primary construction end uses and notable upside in the infrastructure market. From a cadence perspective shipment growth is expected to be weighted towards the second half of the year given a strong first half comparison and transient North Carolina DOT headlines. Annual price increases which become effective from January 1 to April 1 have already garnered market support most importantly in Texas, the Carolinas and Southeast. To that end we expect aggregates pricing to increase in range of 4% to 6%.","Combined with contributions from our cement downstream at magnesia specialties businesses on a consolidated basis we expect total revenues of $4.875 billion to $5.075 billion and EBITDA of $1.348 billion to $1.453 billion.","To conclude we're proud of our 2019 record financial results and industry-leading safety performance. We are equally optimistic about the future of Martin Marietta. As we move forward Martin Marietta remains committed to positioning our business to be aggregates led in high-growth geographies and aligning our product offerings to leverage strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. We will continue to be disciplined in our solid strategic plan and our team's commitment to the world-class attributes of our business, safety, ethics, cost discipline and operational excellence.","We look forward to continuing our strong momentum in 2020 and further strengthening our foundation for long-term success.","If the operator will now provide the required instructions we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open.","Trey Grooms","Okay. Thank you very much. Good morning. ","Howard Nye","Hi Trey.","Trey Grooms","So first off thanks for all the detail that you gave us around the 2020 guide and you guys are obviously facing a more difficult volume comp and as you look at your volume assumption of kind of up 2% to 4%, I know you mentioned shipments might be towards the second half of the year there but more specifically what are you seeing in your backlogs or what are you hearing from your customers that give you confidence in that 2% to 4% range despite the pretty tough comps you guys are facing.","Howard Nye","No, Trey that's a great question. Thank you for that. I mean here's the quick tale of the tape. I mean if we go down I can tell you mid-Atlantic backlogs for our customers are up. If we look at Midwest that just had a killer year last year from a volume perspective [they also] flat. If we look at Mideast they're up. Southwest is up. Cement is up and Rocky Mountain is up. I mean the Rocky is really it was interesting trade because they had a 2019 that felt like 2018 did I think for much of the industry from a weather perspective. So as we're looking across our footprint and looking at most of our divisions what I'll tell you is their backlogs and speaking to their customers actually look it's good or better going into \u201820 than they did going into \u201819 and to your point that's the primary driver that gives us the confidence in the volume prediction that we put out so far today. We feel very comfortable with that.","Trey Grooms","Got you. Thank you. And I guess for my follow-up the infrastructure in market in the 4Q was down slightly you noted in the press release and I know there can be some delays and things like that and we're aware of the short-term situation going on in North Carolina but can you go into more detail about the public side? What you saw in the quarter and is that something that gives you any concern at all as you look into \u201820?","Howard Nye","Actually Trey, does not. What I would say is there were primarily two issues that I would call out. Clearly there were some permitting delays in Georgia that slowed down two projects. Those are resolved and really you had some weather issues that drove some activity or lack of activity in Colorado. If we pause and look at it more broadly here's what I'll tell you if you look in Texas you're looking at letting schedule of $7.7 billion which is very much in their sweet spot. I think they'll be very good with that. What's striking is if you look forward to 2021 it's a $14.1 billion placeholder right now. So those are huge dollars for this year and going into next because you'll see even more design-build.","Keep in mind we're going to start to benefit from the major mobility program in Georgia as well. They're going to come out with $12 billion of new projects to reduce congestion primarily around the Atlanta metro area where in a post Bluegrass World we have a much more significant footprint. Even North Carolina the fact is the state is in very, very good condition. If we look overall at the lettings that they've had over the last several years they put essentially in a very attractive place particularly in Eastern North Carolina. I think the only thing that may happen for a period of months is we may see modestly less maintenance spend but equally if we look at Colorado DOT and again hitting these really hit our top leading states from an infrastructure perspective the surface treatment budget is up significantly. It's up 84 million to 303 million and the capital destruction budget remains steady to last year when they were actually hit with pretty notable weather circumstances.","So if we look at our states by revenue in number one Texas, it looks really good. Number two, Colorado it looks really good. North Carolina looks strong actually. We're going to have some delays early. Georgia looks good and Florida continues to have a budget in the $10 billion range. Again when we're looking at numbers like that on the public side and we see what we think is coming it gives us a lot of conviction around that biggest single part of our business trend","Trey Grooms","Okay, that\u2019s encouraging. I'll pass it on and thanks for taking my questions Howard.","Howard Nye","You bet. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thank you for taking my questions today. First on pricing, if you could just give thoughts on prints and pricing and in more particular how do you feel going into 2020 in terms of how the landscape setup and how is this relative to last year. And if you could really look at it in terms of product line, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Yes, sure Kathryn. A couple of things. One, pricing in the quarter actually looked quite good; it was sub over 5%. Now as Jim mentioned in his portion of the prepared comments, some of that was driven by the fact that we simply had more long-haul in the quarter.","Our rail business was actually up considerably. If you normalize volume, pricing would have been up a little bit over 4% for the quarter, which again is very much in keeping with where we thought. And again, I think you can look at Q4 from a volume and pricing perspective and get some kind of play on how things are going to be as we start going into 2020.","I think we're seeing a better price environment in aggregates than we've seen for a while across our entire footprint. I know we're seeing a better pricing environment in cement than we've seen since we've owned those assets in Texas. So, if we're looking at that pricing environment in particular, Kathryn, you may recall that we had announced an $8 a ton price increase effective April 1.","It looks like most of the rest of the market is there. There is one player that's actually come in as we understand it with the letter that has it at $9.50 a ton. So again, we feel very good about where that is. Equally, if we look at the downstream businesses, I think we'll continue to see price increases for ready mixed concrete in the range of $6 to $8 per cubic yard.","That's probably not a bad bogey if you to keep in mind in both Colorado and Texas right now. And keep in mind, part of what we called them in our prepared commentary is we had some segment changes modestly in concrete that actually gave us some optical headwind on pricing because we've made more of a play in Texas in particular to the housing market because we think that's actually more resilient to weather.","So, as you recall coming into '19, we had said we were planning for a wetter than usual year and that dictated some degree of the shift that we had in the way that we were lining up end users as well. I hope that's response to your question?","Kathryn Thompson","Yes, it's very helpful. Then my second question really ties in the current quarter with your outlook. The current quarter is really with the puts and takes for the margin drag, where the aggregates segments and help us understanding more with one-time in nature versus ongoing and kind of tag into that really into 2020 outlook as you mentioned a long-haul volumes in the quarter or it impacts stripping costs for Colorado impact or but --.","Howard Nye","Yes.","Kathryn Thompson","In terms of the long-haul volumes, how do we think about that cadence going forward, in other words this is more to say unique events in Q4 or is it something to expect in 2020 and really kind of pulling it all together help us understand kind of that aggregates backwards and then what it means going forward?","Howard Nye","Sure. I'll do my best with that, that's a lot. Kathryn, here's what I would say. When I was speaking to Q4 of saying look at that as a prelude, I was really talking more about pricing and more about volume in that context.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay.","Howard Nye","So, here's what I would say with respect to the quarter itself, there were some very specific one-offs in the quarter that I think you need to keep in mind. One, we did have some catch up on grating and Jim referenced that. So, let's call that $7.5 million -- $8 million.","We actually did bring some maintenance at our Hunter cement kiln forward during the quarter because part of what we're aiming for and what we feel like this' going to be a very good year in summit. Yes, it's a higher degree of efficiency and we feel like we positioned ourselves in Q4 for that.","With respect to the Rocky Mountains, we had one capital project in Wyoming and we're basically putting a new plant and at Granite Canyon because that's going to help us feed the Northern Colorado market long-term into sales yards as we see aggregate push in place for the industry occurring Northern Colorado.","That project finished several months later than we had planned. So between that which is now finished. But between that project finishing later and weather being considerably different in Q4 in Colorado that helped drive part of the difference that we see there, just to give you some metrics around that I think this is important for the quarter.","If we're looking at Colorado, Iowa, and asphalt and paving had 57% more weather impacted days in Q4 and by the way that had 30% more full-year impacted days. So, it gives you much clear visibility into 2020. And in the last piece that I would call out is what we mentioned in the South East, we had those two delays on projects on Public Works in and around Atlanta.","And then as you recall when Hurricane Dorian stopped over the Bahamas last year, we have an operation as you may recall in Freeport and we were unable to take one boatload of stone out of Freeport that we otherwise would have been Q4. So, really if you look at the catch-up on grading, the item on summit that I mentioned issues related to Rocky Mountain in weather and that capital project that's now been resolved.","And those two issues in the South East, that's you bridge in Q4. So, as we look at the way Q4 lined up from that perspective. Now, to the other part of your question, I think was really relative to the margins. And what I'll say in that regard is that if we look at what happened in the quarter relative to rail volumes, the increased 20% -- now remember, I view that as good in more ways than not.","I like the fact that we're seeing the rail yards in that expanded network, see the volume go through. But as you'll also recall the margins that we get at the rail yards are not as attractive as the margins we get at truck served quarries. So, you had a modest mix impact on that and that was really the driver on what you saw on a change in margin.","Now, as we think about but instead look like going into 2020 and I think that was the last piece of your question. We're anticipating we're going to see really in 2020 about the same degree of long-haul shipments that we saw in 2019. And to give you a sense of it, and that was probably up over 4 million tons on long-haul in 2019.","So again, we're looking for what we feel like is going to be an attractive 2019 but we don\u2019t think we're going to see that type of shift relative to the other mix. Kathryn, tell me if I hit the issues that you wanted me to address?","Kathryn Thompson","Yes. And really, kind of the point is, is this kind of a one-time or and how should we think about the cadence going forward. So, I -- that did answer my question. Thank you, very much.","Howard Nye","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Ng of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Phil Ng","Hey guys.","Howard Nye","Hi, Phil.","Phil Ng","Morning. Is there a good way to think about impact on volumes in your aggregates business to start the year, with that short-term dynamic you called out in North Carolina? And embedded in your full-year guide, how do you thinking about whether this year and any other borrow in next-cycle, labor and transportation?","Howard Nye","No. what I would say Phil is this. We're again in getting wetter than usual year and that's what we did last year as well. So, we're taking the same approach to weather saying let's plan for to be wetter weather. So, that's what you see in those numbers.","And I think with respect to North Carolina, as we said in the prepared remarks, we view that as wholly transitory, I think you might see some issues but I think they're going to be modest in the first-half of the year. It may be somewhere in the 0.5 million tons to a 1 million tons all in worst case scenario, Phil if you're trying to look at it that way.","But my guess is we're going to see that made up and some private work in the States, so it's something that we wanted to make sure we spoke up but it's not something that we're seeing as disruptive to the overall business. I think importantly on the last part of your question and that was relative to what we see going on with contractors, supply chain, et cetera.","I think trucking has clearly gotten better over the last couple of years. I think contractors could still use more labor than they entirely have. So, as you think contract labor served as a little bit of a governor on what growth was in 2019. I think I'd be foolish to say it wouldn\u2019t be some modest governor going into '20.","But I do think labor has gotten better over time. And in part going back to the commentary that we offered last year and that was consistent with the notion that contractors were willing to pay more to get the labor because they see an emerging public side word coming and the penalties for not completing public work in a timely manner tend to be pretty notable. So, I don\u2019t think you can entirely dismiss it, I think there are issues, I think their issues going to getting better. Did that answers, Phil?","Phil Ng","Yes, that's really helpful. And then award, I think you guys have done an excellent job kind of highlighting your backlogs. For the public side, that and the public builders have obviously reported pretty strong orders, double digit increases. Just curious, have you seen that uptick in your business and what's the typical lag from orders that starts onto your demand?","Howard Nye","It can vary a lot depending on the jobs. Because you can certainly get orders and then on occasion just as we saw in North Georgia, you can see some permitting that delays that may tie into environmental or other issues. So, it can be anywhere from two months to six months fill in and again there can be some noise around both of those. But I do think what we're seeing relative to public is a much healthier '20 than we've seen over the last several years.","Phil Ng","Okay, that's helpful. And just one last one from me, Howard, I couldn't help appreciate on the commentary you said about Texas and it sound like you're feeling a lot more upbeat about the pricing environment. What's embedded in your guidance in any early green shoots to read on the competitive landscape and how guys are behaving in that market. Thanks a lot.","Howard Nye","Hey, you're welcome. Look from what we can tell, obviously we've come out with our price increase letter that was $8 effective April 20. From what we hear from our customers in the marketplace that I think most others have come out with prices that stand like there in that same range. I think there is one that has come out with a letter that's even in excess of that. But that's certainly what we're looking at and it's something that going into the year we've got nice conviction around there.","Phil Ng","Okay, thanks a lot.","Howard Nye","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","Howard Nye","Good morning Anthony, welcome to the call; we're delighted to have you.","Anthony Pettinari","Thank you, Howard. Thank you. Just following-up on Phil's question on cement. Volumes were up double digits for another quarter and I think you just talked about pricing expectations or the pricing opportunity. With regards to volume expectations, I think you referenced cement being up, is it possible that we could see another strong quarter in 1Q for volumes that maybe comparable to what we saw in 4Q and 3Q?","Howard Nye","One think I try to stay away from is talking too much about the quarter that were in the middle of because if we ever talk about a one quarter and it was great, then we don\u2019t talk about the next you're almost indicating one way or the other. But I'll say is that I think everything that we see in Dallas and Fort Worth and in San Antonio and keep in mind that's where two cement plants are -- is a very healthy marketplace. We talked a little bit early in the call of what the key budgets look like there.","At the same time if we come back and take a look at what residential looks like at that marketplace. I mean it's really very, very attractive; Texas and Florida continue to be for example in the top 10 for total permits. DFW has been leading in the nation for a while in single-family and in multi-family.","And what you wouldn\u2019t expect is to still see multi-family so strong this deep into a recovery which tells us what we long San Antonio and that is this is really not been a building and let recovery at. So, I think is we're looking at our cement business. We think it's going to be very busy this year and we think Texas is going to be a great place to be from a volume perspective and a profit perspective.","The one thing I would say to you is we're going to be particularly focused this year on enhancing our efficiencies. If we can get efficiency levels at the levels that we believe are perfectly attainable at both Midlothian and Hunter and we can have a very special year in cement this year.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Howard, I was wondering if you could talk maybe broadly about how the M&A landscape looks here especially in aggregates in some of these higher growth states that you're targeting, I guess it's almost been two years since full graphs and you leveraged quite successfully here?","Howard Nye","Yes, we have. We brought that leverage down very quickly. And as Jim said as we said we would. Look, we're involved in a steady diet of conversations on M&A and part of what we're doing is as you've heard us say before, we're in aggregate slow business and that is what is going to drive our ability to grow the business the way that we would like to going forward.","And I also believe that two things. One, we have a very healthy balance sheet, number two we've got regulatory capacity I think in attractive markets today that others don\u2019t. What that means is you can expect us on the right deal to make sure that we get the right deals, at the same time you should expect us to be very disciplined around transactions that from a marginal order perspective don\u2019t fit what we want to do.","And I think if you go back and take a look at what we did with TXI, what we did with Blue Grass and what we've done with some of the tuck-in transactions we've done in Colorado in the aftermath of our river for the Rocky's transaction. That is an area in which we are very disciplined but I would tell you very, very busy right now.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Anthony.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich","Hi yes, hi good morning everyone.","Howard Nye","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could talk about your demand expectations for core reserve markets versus real serve markets versus real serve markets for \u201820? Should we be looking for them makes dynamic that we saw play out in the fourth quarter continuing at least on a year-over-year basis through part of \u201820?","Howard Nye","Jerry, I think what we anticipated is what we saw for the full year on rail should remain relatively static. So again there was disproportionate growth on the rail side in \u201819. We think we'll see that pretty steady in \u201820 and we think we'll see more coming out of the truck serves. So if you recall Jerry coming into \u201819 we had actually said we thought you'd see incremental margins in the aggregates business of around 55% but we did not anticipate as strong a rail yard year as we did which brought that down just modestly. If you take a look at what incrementals look like for the aggregates business going into \u201820 you'll see that we're planning for that 60% number as opposed to the 55% that we planned for last year. So I think the dialogue around really thinking more or less flat rail \u201819 and the \u201820 and then also going back and giving you that snapshot of where we were on incrementals last year and where we are this year I think that answers your question.","Jerry Revich","It does, yes and to your point earlier on the call look very good volume year overall. It looks like there if some puts and takes around the volumes as you would expect in \u201820 compared to generally robust across more demand in \u201819. From your experience on the pricing cycle how should we think about the cadence of pricing over the course of the year especially considering it sounds like there's going to be a different cadence to demand this year by market compared to what we saw in \u201819.","Howard Nye","I think we've seen the price increases going in the way that we thought that they would Jerry and that is -- they've been going in anywhere from January 1 to April 1 and my guess is there's not going to be anything particularly striking in a difference relative to pricing other than that I think it's going to be modestly stronger in \u201820 than it was in \u201819 because that's usually what healthy volumes do for you. So I wouldn't call out any particular difference relative to cadence.","Jerry Revich","And sorry just a clarification, so you obviously made announcements of January and April price increases. What about the level of mid-year price increase that's embedded at the midpoint of guidance? Can you just give us a bit of context of how much work remains to be done over the balance of the year to get to the midpoint?","Howard Nye","We have not baked in any midyears into that Jerry. So really what we've done in the guidance is anticipated a wetter than usual year. We've anticipated that the pricing is what the pricing is and then mid years come along that would add some momentum to that and keep in mind Jerry one thing to remember even if you do get mid years you're only going to recognize about 25% of a mid-year during the year in which you put the mid year because you still had to work off some backlog and other commitments before it really fully comes into play. So midyears help you a degree in the year in which you put them in. They actually end up being more of your friend in the following year.","Jerry Revich","Perfect. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Brent Thielman","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Question on the Magnesia Specialties business, a little more pressure here in the fourth quarter. It looks like your outlook suggests that might level off here to some degree. Just curious kind of what you're seeing and hearing from customers there that give you some confidence around that?","Brent Thielman","Thanks for the question Brent because that's a business that is such a good business and they just never get the airtime that they deserve but they were faced with two things last year. One Jim mentioned in his comments that there was a slow density of particular around the GM facility and then we saw some customers just rationalizing inventories on the chemical side. As you would imagine we stay very close with those customers. I think we feel like marginally they would have worked through those issues particularly by the time we get towards the end of the first quarter. So if you look at that business I think we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we have that there right now.","Part of that I was really taken with though is if you look at that business and you say look the revenues went down, your gross profit went down as well but on a percentage basis did you go down as much as the revenues and then if you look at the margin what you'll actually see last year is the margin went up. So I think that's just indicative of how well they\u2019ve run that business and how accurately they can forecast where the business is going when they need to. So again if we look directly to the dialog with our customers I think that's what gives us the confidence that it's going to end where we said.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Appreciate that and then Howard just because it's in the release you talked a bit about it but any other details or kind of broader parameters we can speak our sink our teeth into kind of around that [floor] 2025 you're obviously in this really enviable capital deployment position. You talk about kind of lessons learned over the last decade. Can you share what you have learnt from that and what might change kind of as you move for the next five years?","Howard Nye","Yes, what I would say in many respects is it worked pretty well. So there are a lot of aspects of that that we would not change as opposed to things that we would change. What we believe, we believe this business is an aggregates led business and we think it's aggregates led for all the right reasons. We think really being focused on geographies with high population growth or either consuming significant aggregates is where we want to be. The notion that we've moved the business from one or two and 65% of our markets to one or two and 90% of our markets over a decade is a pretty heavy statistic when you think about a big heavy slow-moving industry and the ability to always remain profitable and never cut a dividend, these are things to us that are so fundamental to who we are and what I would tell you is you should continue to look for us to do the types of things that we did when we exited the [report] and we went into Colorado, to do the types of things that we did as we bucked up our business in Atlanta and took a leading position in Maryland.","And to the extent that we can do that in markets that continue to exhibit good population trends, good state fiscal health, multiple end use drivers those are the types of things that we're focused on. When we did sort of 2020 our aim was to be to the point that we had something that looked like an enterprise value of around $20 billion by the time we get into 2020.","I think when we rolled that out most people who were looking at it would have been too kind to have said you can't do it but they may well have thought it and we largely did it. So as we think about sort of 2025 we will continue to be, we'll probably put some numbers out that can look aspirational. We think they're doable and that's how we intend to grow the business.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank You Brent.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from [indiscernible] Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks. Just wondering as you look out to 2020 you came out with a preliminary volume outlook after 3Q which was low to mid single digits and here you're out with a 2% to 4% increase. So pretty similar rate of growth but just wondering just over the last three months has anything shifted good or bad just around your view of the end markets relative to when you came out with preliminary outlook [indiscernible]? ","Howard Nye","What I would say [Gareth] and I would say this is more gut than it is math. So forgive me for that. I would think the sentiment is broadly better now than it was three or four months ago. So if we're going back to the period of time when we would have been going through planning or a budgeting cycle in the fall and took a poll of our division Presidents and Vice Presidents and general managers said okay how do you feel last October, how do you feel now. I think there's a general rule they feel better now than when they felt that. And by the way they didn't go bad then?","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks for that. And then just to clarify some of the expenses that hit in the fourth quarter particularly related to grading. Is there anything to call out if you look out just as far as the cadence of some of these lumpier expenses into 2020 just how you're planning on some of these larger cost items?","Howard Nye","No. I don't think so. For example I think our [Q1] expenses will actually be friendlier in \u201820 than they were in \u201819 for some of the reasons we discussed and I think we've actually on some of the catch-up grading that we've done. I think we're sitting in the type of place that you would expect. I think the CapEx that we've been putting into mobile equipment will continue to be our friend relative to maintenance and repair. So [Gareth] there is not a cadence out there this year that I would be wanting to highlight to you right now. I think the big driver for a little bit of a stutter step there at year-end was volumes were just up more than the people would have thought and because of that we had some catch-up to do but we don't see that in \u201820 right now","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks again.","Howard Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stanley Elliott of Stifel. Your line is open.","Stanley Elliott","Good morning everybody. Thank you all for taking the question. Hey on the capital spend side I think you kind of touched on a little bit but you had been run an elevator in close with depreciation. Can you talk a little bit about what the plans for CapEx or I mean is it rolling stock like you called out? Is an expansion projects just trying to get a flavor for you see the most opportunity?","Jim Nickolas","Yes. Hey Stanley it's Jim. So I would say in aggregates in total our CapEx is roughly constant as a percent of sales and we've been doing that in \u201818 and \u201819 and expect the same in 2020. We have been spending more on mobile in the prior years. We are shifting a bit now to plant upgrades and efficiency improvements. So I would say we're close to, most of it is maintenance capital but it\u2019s efficiency improvement capital at the same time. So no searching is going forward there.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect and then last questions on kind of the one off stripping your cost there. Are you seeing anything else within the cost environment that's concerning and heading into 2020 be it labor or energy costs or anything else that you would want to call out we should be aware of?","Howard Nye","Stanley we're really not. If you look back several years\u2019 labor has never been an issue for us. It doesn't look like it's going to be this year either and as we're looking at the other inputs again we feel very confident with it. So I don't see anything that would really move in that respect.","Stanley Elliott","Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.","Howard Nye","Thanks you Stanley.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Your line is open.","Adam Thalhimer","Hey good morning guys.","Howard Nye","Hi Adam.","Adam Thalhimer","Howard, I wanted to start on aggregates pricing. I just wanted to make sure I understood I mean pricing accelerated all throughout 2019. We got it accelerating again in 2020. I'm just curious what's really driving that?","Howard Nye","I think volume is clearly a friend on that and obviously in the fourth quarter there was some degree of mix relative to rail and we did that. But again if we go back over time part of what we've seen Adam and we've spoken of it I think it surprised people that we would have the ability to get price in a down market but we did and part of what we indicated as we thought we would have even more ability to get price centered on market and I think that's what you saw last year.","Keep in mind we end up being at the end of the day a relatively small piece of overall construction from a cost perspective 10% of the cost of building road, 2% of the cost of building a home and somewhere between those percentages on a non-resident project we are [selling] the product that's going to make or break a general contractor or sub on either getting the job, not getting the job or being profitable.","At the same time we have a product in the ground that gets more valuable by the day and we want to make sure that we have the ability to capture that value because the barriers to entry continue to be very, very high. So I think you have all of those factors coalescing and I think that's evidence in what you see the pricing.","Adam Thalhimer","And then I think it was in their letter Howard you called out the wind projects being a slight headwind this year. Can you just give us some more color on that? How impactful is that?","Adam Thalhimer","So [no point intended on the] wind projects being a headwind right. So what we're seeing Adam is really the tax investment credits and if projects aren't under construction at the end of 2020, really that's been an issue in two areas for us one in the Midwest and to a degree in the southwest more in the Midwest than in Southwest. Right now we don't see it as a notable headwind. We really just more called it out because we recognize that the tax credits are going away and we want to be sensitive to it and the other thing that we're sensitive to it I spoke about the fact that Midwest volume is going into the year look relatively flat to last year but Midwest volumes last year were really up. So that's an area the country on a percentage basis we just want to be thoughtful around.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Congrats.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Michael [indiscernible] Research. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good morning gentlemen and Suzanne. ","Howard Nye","Good morning Michael.","Unidentified Analyst","You called in your release this morning, you talked about the path potential positive on regulatory driven improvement in efficiency and trying to get projects let. Any sense on how company think that will come through given what's going on in politics wise and how that could impact maybe this cadence in term on lettings in the next couple of years and maybe you combine that with them maybe potential federal bill and say 2021 or 2022. ","Howard Nye","Sure. Michael it's going to be scientific and anecdotal all at the same time. So have we seen some states go from taking seven years to get jobs out to being more like two years to get jobs that we have and has North Carolina for example been a part of that? Absolutely. Have we seen other states getting better at that? No doubt. And even in the president's draft budget that he's put out of course he's talking about the total $1 trillion infrastructure investments. So that's the broader picture that he has painted at the same time even he starts talking about in that broad-based budget more of what he would like to see done.","I think we've seen some edges of it in NEPA reform on what can happen on getting projects approved more quickly. So what I will tell you is kind of sit here today and give you definitive numbers on what we think they would be up. No, I can't but at the same time can I look over the past several years and say that North Carolina for example was able to go through $2 billion that had really been put on the shelves because they couldn't get jobs out as quickly as they wanted to because they had gotten more efficient at it. Yes, do we think it will continue to get it better at the federal level? Yes. And do we think that will likely be part of a new highway bill? We think it probably will be.","Unidentified Analyst","That's great, great color. Thanks for that Howard. Just one quick follow-up when you talking back to M&A and how you're looking at or having active discussion so many folks are those folks also expectations moving higher given some of the publicly available data and the expectations that I think most people have in the industry and is that causing some of maybe, some lockup relative to things maybe getting done in a more rapid environment in the next say 6 to 18 months?","Howard Nye","Michael, I think it can vary a lot. I think it can vary depending on are you talking branded, are you talking limestone and rock and sand and gravel, are you talking of pure play or are you talking to vertical play, are you talking East coast are you talking middle of the country or West. So I think it moves around. What I would say at the end of the day is people recognize these are very valuable businesses. Often times they are justifiably pretty proud of them which is one of the reasons that we have to make sure that we can get a good synergy when we go and do these transactions. So again I think there's a lot of dialogue. We will not overreach on things. We will continue to be responsible with it but we're certainly seeing things today that if things come together we can execute on and I think do quite well with them.","Unidentified Analyst","Excellent response. Thanks Howard.","Howard Nye","Michael, thank you and again welcome to the call.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Seldon Clarke of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Seldon Clarke","Hey guys thanks for the question. Just sticking with M&A, how much capacity do you think you have for the right deal and just could you give us a sense of maybe how many deals you think are potentially out there that could still move the needle for you guys?","Howard Nye","Well I'll tell you what let me do this way. I'll address the second part of it and that is the quantum of deals. I'll let Jim come back and talk a little bit about firepower. The fact is we're always engaged in at least or probably more than a handful of dialogues and again they can vary pretty considerably in size. So the conversations continue to be regular and they continue to be rich in many respects and rich I don't mean numbers, I mean just in the form of dialogue. That's it and let me turn it over to Jim and he can talk a little bit about firepower.","Jim Nickolas","Well, we did acquire Bluegrass for $1.6 billion a few years ago. We did that comfortably and delevered rapidly. We could do that size and larger today readily. So I say we have ample firepower we can do a larger deals. We can do multiple or medium-sized deals and again it is our top priority getting the right acquisition at the right price. So we will make it happen if we need to but it would be very comfortable for us from firepower perspective to do any deals that would be coming to fruition the next two years?","Seldon Clarke","Okay. That's helpful and then just what's going on with elevated valuations, I mean if the right deal doesn't present itself? What do you think the right kind of leverage ratio is on a more ongoing basis and how should we think about capital deployment ex-M&A?","Jim Nickolas","Well, our priorities have not changed and so I\u2019ll answer the second part of the question first aside M&A the reinvesting in the business and CapEx we talked about that roughly 8%-9% of sales typically what we shoot for. It's what we've been doing and beyond that we are returning capital to shareholders in the form of higher dividends which we've been doing last couple years, meaningful increases in the dividend rate and then share buyback which we have also been doing in the last few years. So we'll continue to do those two things. In terms of leverage we have a stated target leverage of 2 to 2.5 times. We are currently at the lower end of that range. Of course that's done in the context of M&A pipeline, in the context of economic outlook and our expectations for the year. So there's no static view we take but by and large 2 to 2.5 times is our debt EBITDA ratio.","Howard Nye","Seldon, if we think about what's happened over the last 24 months, 18 months we've done the second largest transaction in our company's history. The year before that we raised our dividend by 9%. This past year by 15%. Obviously the board will look at that again in August but to do a transaction the way that we did with Bluegrass to delever as quickly as we did to be in a position to take the dividend up and buy shares back is a very nice place to be and I think that speaks well to the discipline that the team has shown overall on capital requirement.","Seldon Clarke","Fine. I appreciate the questions. Thanks guys.","Howard Nye","Thank you Seldon and again thank you for joining our call today.","Seldon Clarke","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Adrian Huerta of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Adrian Huerta","Thank you. Good morning. Two questions one is on cement prices specifically in Texas. What are your views on impropriety prices for Texas and if you think that that could drive potentially even higher increases on cement prices? And the second one is on your guidance for cement gross profit. Aside from prices what else are you expecting to drive margins higher this year?","Howard Nye","I guess number one Adrian thank you for your question. Number two, if we just look at Texas cement overall and Texas consumed about 18.7 million tons of cement last year. About 13.5 of that was from domestic producers in Texas. So the short answer is you're going to have to have some degree of import that's coming into the state right now simply to meet the needs. I think if you look at where our plants are very much by design in Dallas Fort Worth and in San Antonio they have ability for water imports to come in and meaningfully interdict our businesses is low and again that's by design.","I think you will continue to see the need and the desire for cement to continue to go up in that state. I think the fact that we're talking about an $8 ton price increase there, demonstrates that demand supply band is going to be somewhere in our favor. Clearly that is going to help drive our business.","The other thing that I would say to your point we will clearly have less kiln maintenance expenses in \u201820 than we had last year and then the number that we know it's going to be real it's just a more elusive number is what you get from the shear efficiencies that we believe we will recognize that both Midlothian and at Hunter. Again, as I look across the business and think about the areas that I think have the potential to have a really pretty special year this year. I would put cement somewhere near the head of that list Adrian","Adrian Huerta","Excellent. Thank you, Howard.","Howard Nye","You are welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Chabran, of On Field Investment Research. Your line is now open.","Paul Chabran","Hi good morning gentlemen and thank you for taking my question. Just one question if I may. We are seeing more and more large aggregate producers nowadays moving towards recycle aggregates. I just want to understand whether it's something that you\u2019d be considering and if so what do you think could be the impact on the value of your aggregate result? Another quick follow-up on coming on the -- you mentioned that aggregates volume have been hit by some delays in infrastructure project in North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado. If I remember well could you give us an idea of what your volumes would have been in Q4 excluding this impact? ","Howard Nye","Absolutely try to. Let's do the recycle issue first and what I would say Paul is recycle is going to be an issue that's not going to hit all markets the same way it's going to hit different markets differently. So if you think of our markets such as Los Angeles or markets such as Houston that really in LA you've got depletion. In Houston, you have no coarse aggregates that are indigenous there, which means that is you have certain destruction of buildings, you can have crush concrete in that marketplace that can be used in some instances as a base material.","Keep in mind in many instances recycle is going to be more usable in a commercial application as supposed to a DOT application because oftentimes they won't meet the more rigorous DOT specifications.","So what I would say is -- while I think today's pricing is in aggregates and what I think, frankly think they're going to be for the next decade when you see more recycle on the edges I think you will on occasion. I don't think it's going to be a huge displacing factor. Keep in mind even recycle that you see in recycled asphalt commonly referred to as wrap is really more used to pull the liquid out of buildings as opposed to the stone. So I think we see it that way.","Relative to the second part of your question that was with respect to delays what I would say is clearly we did see some of delays in Georgia. We saw some delays in North Carolina. I don't want to quantify exactly how much I think that would have moved the aggregate tonnage. I think it would have moved it a bit. Importantly those are high profit states. So I think it probably would have hit more bottom line on profits as opposed to bottom line relative to volumes.","Paul Chabran","Okay. Thank you very much.","Howard Nye","Thank you Paul.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Paul Roger of Exane BNP Paribas, your line is now open.","Rob Whitworth","Hi, hello. This is Rob Whitworth on for Paul Roger.","Howard Nye","Very good.","Rob Whitworth","Hi there. I want to start by asking is this going to accelerate Greenfield investment spending and what returns you typically make on these investments?","Howard Nye","I'm sorry Rob relative to Greenfield? ","Rob Whitworth","Yes, please.","Howard Nye","Yes. I guess we would say several things. We think there is a role in what we do for green fielding at the same time if we look at our volume this past year at 191 million tons and we look all the way through a cycle. I would ask you to remember this at the peak of last cycle we produced and sold 205 million tons. At the bottom of the last cycle 125 million tons and 191 last year.","Of that 191, 40 million tons are due to acquisitions over the last decade-ish. So we're comparing same on same all the way through a cycle take the 190 that we just finished within 2019. Take 40 million tons from it, it puts us at 150 million tons same on same versus 205 at peak and 125 at the bottom. That's not a long way of saying I don't think we're in a position today that adding Greenfield sites is a particularly value enhancing strategy for us.","We have ample reserves and very attractive markets. Green fielding to me is when you want to go into a new market or you've got reserves that you're trying to protect. The other thing that I would say is most Greenfield applications will probably take around seven years to put in and again you've got several components you have to be mindful of number one environmentally what you're dealing with delegated state authority from using federal statutes but then more importantly what's happening relative to local land use.","Rob that's the piece of it in the United States, but I think most people miss because, I think most people feel like the bigger issue is environmental. The bigger issue is in fact land use. So as we think about it have we opened the single largest Greenfield operation on the Union Pacific's vast network about five years ago? We have but again a very strategic play to make sure we can supply DOT spec stone and to Houston for a generation. Have we looked at opening underground mines in places like in the Midwestern U.S.? We have but we haven't taken on a slew of green fields because at the end of the day we don't think it's the best use of our capital.","Rob Whitworth","Very clear. Thank you. And just as a follow-up you did touch on this slightly earlier but your asphalt margins disappointed a bit again and I appreciate this is mostly bad weather in Colorado but in terms of looking ahead do you see a big potential improvement in 2020 given a potential tailwind from IMO 2020?","Howard Nye","No, I do think we'll see a potential tailwind. I mean again weather was the primary driver for the variance that you've seen. We talked a little bit about the sheer quantum of days that we lost because of the weather. If we look at the backlogs that we have in that business going into the year they really look very, very good. If we look in from a customer perspective, we're looking at already over 50% of our backlog being booked for the year and for me need to be able to say that to you in the first half of February is a pretty heavy place.","Rob Whitworth","Brilliant. Thank you. ","Howard Nye","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Howard Nye for any closing remarks.","Howard Nye","Well thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. We continue to focus on maximizing value for shareholders as we build on our strong results and strive to realize the company's full potential. Given Martin Marietta\u2019s world class attributes and our expectation of a sustainable and steady public private sector construction activity we believe 2020 will be another record year for Martin Marietta.

My name is Jonathan, and I'll be your coordinator today. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the company's prepared remarks. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Suzanne Osberg, Vice President-Investor Relations for Martin Marietta. Ms. Osberg, you may begin.","Suzanne Osberg","Good morning, and thank you for joining Martin Marietta's fourth quarter and year end 2017 earnings call. With me today are Ward Nye, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Nickolas, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","To facilitate today's discussion, as we have done in the past, we have made available during this webcast and on our website supplemental financial information. As detailed on slide 2, today's teleconference may include forward-looking statements, as defined by securities laws in connection with future events, future operating results or financial performance. Like other businesses, we are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise. We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our fourth quarter earnings release and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on both our own and the SEC Web site.","As a reminder, all margin references in today\u2019s teleconference are based on total revenues. Any non-GAAP measures discussed today are explained and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in our supplemental financial information, which is also available on our Web site and in our SEC filings.","I will now turn the call over to Ward.","Ward Nye","Thank you, Suzanne, and thank you all for joining today\u2019s teleconference. As announced in this morning\u2019s release, 2017 was a record setting year for Martin Marietta. For the first time, we generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA of over $1 billion. Notably, this achievement coincided with the best safety performance in our company\u2019s history. In addition to these milestones, we establish records for revenues, profitability and earnings per diluted share for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Our record performance, which was achieved without aggregates volume growth, validates the steadfast commitment to our core values and the disciplined execution of our strategic plan.","Our financial performance starts with operating our facilities safely. I\u2019m proud to report that we surpassed world-class loss time instant rate levels company-wide. Further, half of our divisions exceeded world-class total entry instant rates, a remarkable safety performance is rewarding in its own right. That said, elevated safety awareness across the company has also reduced downtime from workplace incidence leading to higher revenues and profitability.","For the full year 2017, we delivered the following record consolidated results. Revenues of $4 billion, EBITDA of over $1 billion, gross profit of $972 million, earnings from operations of $700 million and earnings per diluted share of $11.25, which includes a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $4.07 per diluted share from the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for 2017 or 2017 Tax Act. Importantly, we achieved full year record earnings per diluted share of $7.18, excluding this one-time benefit, an increase to $0.55 compared with 2016. Geographic positioning, price leadership, prudent cost discipline and reinvestment in our business through appropriate capital allocation contributed to these record results.","Our performance is all the more noteworthy given the externally driven volume headwinds that limited shipping and production volumes through much of the year. Coming into 2017, we fully anticipated accelerated growth in aggregates volumes, particularly in the public arena, given the anticipated benefits from the Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act or FAST Act together with various states and local initiatives. Our peers, along the third-party forecasters, also unequivocally echo this sentiment.","Indeed Martin Marietta benefited from positive momentum in private residential and non-residential construction. However, infrastructure activity proved disappointing for us, the industry as a whole and the nation; contrary to third-party forecasts, highways and streets construction spending decreased 4% nationally in 2017 as near record precipitation, government uncertainty, labor constraints and slower than anticipated pace of public contract lettings exerted downward pressure on highway construction activity. As a result, the company\u2019s full year aggregate shipments decreased 1 million tons compared with 2016, almost 9 million tons lower than our initial 2017 guidance.","This shortfall, in both actual and forecasted volumes, makes our financial performance all the more noteworthy. That said, the need to address our nation\u2019s hired infrastructure did not go away. America\u2019s highways, bridges, roads and streets only got a year older in 2017, and are still largely in desperate need of repairs and to our expansion. These projects will get done some in 2018 or more likely over the next several years. Thus, from a suppliers\u2019 perspective, we\u2019ll like be busy for the foreseeable future.","For the year, our building materials business, which includes aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations, posted record revenues of $3.7 billion, a 4% increase. Pricing improved across all product lines and segments as the business continues to benefit from strong underlying market fundamentals. Full year aggregates product line pricing improved 4.5% despite lower shipment volumes. The Southeast and Mid-America Groups generated increases of 9% and 5% respectively, driven by continued price leadership. Product mix and ongoing competitive pressures led to a 2% price improvement for the West Group as several large energy projects requiring higher price materials were completed in 2016 and did not renew in 2017.","Cement pricing improved 4% for the year, reflecting robust construction activity in the Dallas\/Fort Worth area. Ready mixed concrete and asphalt average selling prices increased 3% and 11%, respectively. Strong demand in Colorado allowed for favorable asphalt pricing throughout the year. Shipment levels for the building materials business vary across both product lines and geographies. First, let\u2019s take a look at the aggregates product line. Full year shipments declined 1% overall with both the Mid-America and West Group\u2019s reporting decreased volumes. The Southeast Group generated volume growth of 5% despite the previously discussed headwinds, demonstrating the underlying strength of construction demand into Florida and Georgia markets.","Overall, full year aggregate shipments to the infrastructure market decreased 2%, reflecting continued under-investment in the nation\u2019s infrastructure coupled with marginal construction activity from the FAST Act and project delays. As a result, the infrastructure market comprised only 40% of full year aggregates volumes. Below the company\u2019s most recent five year average of 43% and 10 year average of 48%. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by positive fourth quarter infrastructure trends in Colorado, Georgia and portions of North Carolina and Texas.","Aggregate shipments to the non-residential market decreased 4% for the year, while the Southeast Group reported strong heavy industrial construction growth. The West Group consistent with management\u2019s expectations reported a double-digit decline in non-residential shipments due to the completion of several large industry related projects in Texas in 2016 that were not immediately replaced in 2017. The non-residential market represented 31% of full year aggregate shipments. Continued strength in housing across the company\u2019s geographic footprint, particularly in the Western and Southeastern United States led to 12% increase in full year aggregate shipments to the residential market.","Notably Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Colorado key geographies for the building materials business comprised six of the top 10 states for growth in single family housing unit starts for the 12 months ended December 2017. The residential market accounted for 21% of full year aggregates product line shipments.","To conclude our discussions on end use markets, aggregate volumes for the ChemRock\/Rail market accounted for the remaining 8% of the full year shipments and declined 10% versus 2017, driven by reduced balanced and agricultural line shipments. We view cement as the valuable product, particularly in the Dallas, Fort Worth area given its attractive underlying market fundamentals. As such, in 2017, we accepted temporary volume reductions to support our long-term cement strategy of value before volume. To that effect, full year cement shipments declined 2%, while cement pricing increased nearly 4%. Notably, fourth quarter cement volumes improved 2% reflecting the company\u2019s disciplined approach to recapturing market share temporarily lost early on a year.","For the full year, ready mix concrete shipments increase slightly with strong demand in the Dallas, Fort Worth and Denver markets, mostly offset by decreased energy sector shipments. Our actual shipments improved 4%. The building materials business reported record gross profit of $876 million, a 5% increase over the prior year. Ongoing pricing improvements coupled with the benefits from the strategic deployment of capital into our business contributed in part to 110 basis point expansion in the aggregates products line four year gross margin.","The Southeast Group gross profit increased $17 million and gross margin expanded 280 basis points, driven by aggregates pricing and volume growth. The mid west division leverage recent investments in mobile equipment and reduced its repair cost 9% on a per unit basis and 4% on an absolute dollar basis, contributing to the mid America Group\u2019s 170 basis points gross margin expansion.","Our Magnesia Specialties business posted record revenues of $270 million, an increase of 5% compared with 2016. Higher energy and maintenance costs held gross profit in earnings from operations relatively flat. Martin Marietta is dedicated to disciplined capital allocation to enhance share holder value. In 2017, we deployed $432 million of capital in our business, including mobile fleet purchases that have reduced ongoing repair and maintenance costs and returned $209 million to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","In fact, we\u2019ve returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases since the announcement of our share repurchase program in February 2015. Currently, we have 14.7 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization.","In December, we successfully executed the largest bond deal in the Company's history, issuing $1.4 billion of debt in anticipation of closing the Bluegrass Materials Company acquisition in the first half of 2018. That transaction remains subject to customary regulatory process and other closing conditions. The bond deal itself was five times oversubscribed, allowing us to obtain favorable credit terms and establish 30 year benchmark bond we opened in a category of debt investors to the company. The newly issued debt reflects the weighted average interest rate of 3.5%.","For the 12 months ended December 2017, our ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the applicable credit agreement, was 1.58 times. Pursuant to certain provisions of the credit agreement, the ratio excludes the debt issued in connection with the pending Bluegrass Materials acquisition.","In summary, our ability to post record safety and operating results despite externally driven volume headwinds demonstrates the importance of our strategic plan as well as the Company\u2019s ability to execute against that plan. Based on these strengths, our 2018 guidance, which is included in today\u2019s release, reflects our optimism that Martin Marietta will continue to benefit from broadening demand across all three of our primary construction end use markets. As we look to 2018, we remain confident that the United States is in the midst of a steady albeit at extended cyclical recovery across our geographic footprint.","While meaningful and consistent infrastructure activity has yet to materialize for the industry, we believe public heavy construction will gain traction in 2018 and as noted earlier, will likely continue and accelerate over the next several years. Third party forecast support increased construction spending in 2018, particularly for aggregates intensive highways and streets.","We\u2019re also encouraged by the long-term benefits from Martin Marietta, our customers and the industry from the 2017 FAST Act signed into law in December. This legislation provides strong signal and renewed confidence to employers, allowing for long-term solutions to address ongoing labor constraints and future capital investment needs.","Equally important, passage of the 2017 Tax Act provides momentum for elected officials to address both increased as well as more sustainable infrastructure funding commensurate with the nation\u2019s much needed investment. In that regard, as you\u2019re likely aware, the administration has this week announced a framework for its long awaited infrastructure modernization plan. While more specific terms and timing of this plan will likely emerge from Congress during the second half of 2018, the presence broad out time calls for an additional $200 billion over the next decade to help facilitate this promised investment of $1.5 trillion in the nation\u2019s roads, bridges, railways and water ways.","Other policy objectives outlined in the administration\u2019s infrastructure guideline are primarily fourfold, streamlining federal permitting, investing in rural projects, developing a skilled workforce and stimulating new investments. Notably, all the indications are that the White House is open to new sources of funding and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chair, Bill Shuster, has indicated that the legislation needs to be bipartisan, principally responsible and make real long-term investments in our nation inflow.","In short the reality of the 2017 Tax Act and the potential of infrastructure modernization R&D promising to our business and the nation. Please note, however, our 2018 guidance provided today does not reflect any benefits from potential legislation increasing federal infrastructure spending.","Again, while expectations are that some form of enhanced infrastructure bill will be inactive in 2018, the benefits should more fully emerge in 2019. Yet even now, strong customer confidence and overall improving sentiment lead us to believe that infrastructure activity will benefit in 2018 and beyond from the FAST Act, the 2017 Tax Act and various state and local infrastructure initiatives. Positive employment and population trends in many of the attractive markets in which Martin Marietta operates support continued strength in private construction activity.","Non-residential construction is expected to increase modestly in both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years. Dodge Data & Analytics forecast the 3% increase in non-residential construction starts in 2018 and the Dodge Momentum Index, a monthly measure of initial non-residential construction planning, remains elevated after surging to 151.5 in December. With the price of oil somewhat rebounding, energy companies will look to grow and we expect the new energy related projects will bid in 2018 with construction activity in 2019 and beyond as regulatory permitting and final investment decisions are either made and\/or approved.","The residential market continues to expand, providing the impetus for future non-residential and infrastructure activity. Multi-family building remains solid in several of our top metropolitan areas. Additionally, in several key stage we're beginning to see grater levels of single family housing activity, which is more aggregates intensive. Robust residential construction is expected to continue, particularly in core Martin Marietta markets, driven by high employment, historically low levels of construction activity over the previous years, low mortgage rates, increased lot development and higher multi-family rental rates.","For 2018, we expect aggregates shipments to increase 4% to 6%. Our outlook anticipates growth in all three primary aggregate construction end used markets and faster expansion into West and Southeast Groups and comparatively slower growth in the mid-America Group, which historically has generated the company\u2019s highest margins. To be more specific; expectations are for infrastructure shipments to increase in the mid single digits; non-residential volumes to increase in the low to mid single digits; residential shipments to increase in the high single digits; and ChemRock\/Rail shipments to remain stable.","Aggregates product line pricing is expected to increase 3% to 5% with total revenues ranging from $2.490 billion to $2.595 billion and gross profit from $655 million to $715 million. For the rest of the building materials business, we expect cement revenues to range from $415 million to $445 million and gross profit from $140 million to $160 million, and ready mix concrete and asphalt and paving revenues to range from $1.370 billion to $1.445 billion, and gross profit from $160 million to $175 million.","Our Magnesia Specialties business is expected to have another solid year with revenues ranging from $265million to $270 million in gross profit from $85 million to $90 million. On a consolidated basis, we expect total revenue to range from $4.160 billion to $4.355 billion; gross profit from $1.40 billion to $1.140 billion; selling, general and administrative expenses from $275 million to $285 million; and EBITDA to range from $1.75 million to $1,185million.","Interest expense is expected to range from $125 million to $130 million, reflecting the company\u2019s $1.4 billion bond issuance. As a result of recent 2017 Tax Act, management expects the company's effective tax rate to range from 20% to 22%, excluding discrete events in 2018 versus 2017\u2019s guidance of 28%. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $450 million to $500 million as we continued prudently deploy capital into our business. As noted, our 2018 guidance excludes any benefit from potential increase in federal infrastructure funding and any benefit from the pending acquisition of Bluegrass Materials, which is expected to be accretive to earnings per share and cash flow in the first full year of ownership.","To conclude 2017 was remarkable year for Martin Marietta. EBITDA of over $1 billion and the best safety and financial performance in the company\u2019s history. Building on this movement, we\u2019re confident in Martin Marietta\u2019s long-term outlook. Looking ahead to 2018, we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on the durable mutli-year construction recovery across our geographic footprint and anticipated increased demand for infrastructure projects and private sector construction activity. In 2018 and beyond, we remain committed to world-class safety standards, price leadership, diligent cost discipline and operational excellence as we elevate Martin Marietta from an aggregates industry leader to a globally recognized world-class organization and further enhance long-term shareholder value.","If the operator will now provide the required instructions, we will turn our attention to addressing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group. Your question please.","Kathryn Thompson","First is just on system guidance. Could you give a little bit more color in terms of important drivers for assumptions, including the rising diesel costs and the ability to make-up for those lost volumes in 2017 from storms? Thank you.","Ward Nye","We see volume better in every major market in which we operate. So if we look across our space, we don\u2019t see volume down anywhere. If we look at the elite eight states in which we operate meaning, Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Indiana and Iowa, we see all those states up pretty markedly. And we don\u2019t see them up in one area, we see infrastructure being better, we see non-res better and we see residential being better, to answer your question very directly.","With respect to energy itself, we do see diesel going up year-over-year. Based on the guidance that we put out at least baked into our guidance, let\u2019s not call it out specifically. We are seeing the diesel for the year be up around $0.44 per gallon in \u201818 versus where it was in \u201917. The quick math is going to tell you that\u2019s going to be plus, minus an incremental $20 million. And in case you\u2019re wondering we used about 44.8 million gallons of diesel fuel last year. So that\u2019s how we work out to those numbers. I hope that\u2019s helpful.","Kathryn Thompson","And I assume are you -- you're assuming that you will or won\u2019t make up for those total loss volumes from storm?","Ward Nye","What we\u2019re assuming is that we will make-up some of them. We\u2019re not assuming that we\u2019ll make-up all of them. And again, we\u2019ll just see how that flows through but at least as this point that\u2019s how we bake that in Kathryn.","Kathryn Thompson","Given a little choppy end to the quarter, there is some part says that there are many parts in the U.S. that did really quite well. But there were certain ones including Texas where they just can\u2019t seem to catch a break when it comes to the all important work. So if you look forward into 2018, could you walk through either the inter quarter cadence from Q4 \u201917 and may be what we\u2019re looking forward into early 2018 and with that may mean in terms of the longer term look.","Ward Nye","Kathryn, if you go back over the last two years what we\u2019ve seen in both '16 and '17, we\u2019re actually pretty mild Q1. So we\u2019ve seen better Q1 on a compared basis for last two years than we would have seen historically in the company. So here is what I\u2019ll tell you. If we go back and look at the last couple of years and I'm looking at these percentages as the percentage of the year. So we would have seen revenues in Q1 in \u201916 and \u201917 of around 21%, we would have gross profit in Q1 in '17 around 16% and EBITDA about 15% of full year.","Now if we go back and say really what does it look like over a longer period of time and take a look at what that snapshot looks like, it looks more like revenues 17%, it looks more like a gross profit of 8% and an EBITDA of around 8%. One thing that I\u2019ll remind you and we talk a lot about this, but it\u2019s important to remember at this time of the year in particular, typically the first quarter is made or broken in the last two weeks of March, I mean that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen forever, that\u2019s usually when the construction season starts in earnest. So what I would encourage you to think about Kathryn is the more typical cadence to the year and what I\u2019ve just given you at least relative to Q1 the last couple of years, but more likely Q1 over a longer term is the way that I would think about it. So I hope that helps.","Kathryn Thompson","And then finally on fly ash, so you\u2019ve been watching shortage of gypsum and also fly ash throughout the U.S. impacting different industries, and we definitely noticed a tightness and ability to get fly ash in State of Texas in particular. Is this something that you\u2019re also seeing and also clarify how that may or may not impact your cement operations?","Ward Nye","Well, the short answer is yes, we're seeking it. And I think it will provide some choppiness for ready mix producers in parts of the United States. Keep in mind we're the largest producer of cement in Texas. So I think you can provide some choppiness for people for let's call it six, seven, eight weeks, I think it certainly could. From a cement suppliers\u2019 perspective, look if there is not fly ash, we're happy to fill that void with cement and it think we can do that just fine. So I think we're sitting in a pretty good place from that prospective Kathryn.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms from Stephens, Inc. Your question please.","Trey Grooms","First one from me Ward is on the aggregate selling price guidance of 3% to 5%. Are you expecting any product mix impact within that range? I know there was some expectation I think for some more base stone to be shipped this year maybe than what we saw last year just based on the projects that are out there. Is that still the case? And is that baked into the range? And if so, what\u2019s going to be the approximate impact you\u2019re expecting there.","Ward Nye","It certainly is. There are two things that I would tell you are in that, and it\u2019s hard to tease it all out with specific trade. But I do think you're going to see more infrastructure work this year than last year. I think you're going to see more new infrastructure work than last year. That does mean that you're going to have more base product going up and that\u2019s clearly on average about 30% lower ASP as opposed to clean stone that\u2019s going directly into ready mix or into asphalt. So I think that is going to matter.","The other thing that I think we called out fairly clearly is we think growth on a relative basis is going to be more robust in portions of the West. So again if we\u2019re looking at places like Texas and Colorado, those markets are still, let\u2019s call it, 70% of corporate average. So there is clearly some of that. So when we\u2019re looking at the 3 to 5, you could probably take that up half return-ish or so as we look at what pricing will be if you\u2019re really looking same on same.","The other thing that I\u2019d tell you is there are couple of things last year too that are important to remember relative to the pricing that we reported. Number one, we did see some product mix issues in Texas in 2017, because I want to remember, we did finished some large energy related projects at the end of \u201916 that were principally used in clean stone. If we really do a same-on-same, you probably would have seen another percentage maybe a little bit more than that up just in the Southwest division all by itself.","And we also had some excess build portfolio in many respects what\u2019s almost the waste product that we sold or feel on a bypass job in North Carolina. And we sold about a million tons of that at $1.76 last year. I give you all that background number one as a reminder that those were in last year\u2019s number. And two just give you a sense of how constructive, we think that piece of the business continues to work overall last year and what we feel like is very attractive outlook for this year.","Trey Grooms","And then just to understand on the tail end of seeing more base rock, which sounds like could be the case at least for some of this year behind that comes more of the higher ASP stone. Does that come pretty quickly or what\u2019s the general lag there?","Ward Nye","It can come relatively quickly depending on the nature of the projects. It could be anywhere from two to six months would not be unusual lag time so again, depending on the time of the year. And you make a very good point. If base stone is going down, the day in the hours going to become that asphalt or concrete is going to go on top of that base stone. So it\u2019s important to recognize when we\u2019re having a conversation with you around more base stone from where we sit that\u2019s a very good sign. And it goes back to the comments that I gave in the prepared remarks relative to this being an extended cycle. And those are some of the very few reasons that we think the cycle will be extended.","Trey Grooms","Last one from me just on Bluegrass the pending acquisition there. You mentioned that it is progressing, I think you\u2019re still looking for first half \u201918 closing. But could you give us any more color around how that\u2019s going. I know you put out some very high level detail on some volume and revenue I think through September. But any updated thoughts on around accretion or potential divestitures that maybe required or anything like that?","Ward Nye","Well, here is what I would say. The process with DOJ is going exactly as we thought it would, so there have been no surprises there. As you may recall, we spoke last time about entering into a timing arrangement with them. So we continue to work in a fashion that we think is really constructive. We are not seeing anything from that process that makes us think about this transaction any differently than we did today that we announced this transaction.","So to the extent that there are divestitures, the divestitures will not be such that they\u2019re value disruptive to the transaction, so again exactly the way that we thought of it. We have also not changed the way financially that we think about this deal. It will be accretive on EPS and cash flow during the first full year. We\u2019ll obviously talk to you more about that in granular detail once we own it. Since we don\u2019t own those assets yet today, we still have to be careful about what we say in public that we have it already.","But again, we're excited about that deal; we like the fact that we\u2019re picking it up when places like Georgia are 20% below mid-cycle; we're seeing literally billions of dollars worth of work coming in Maryland; we think we're the right owner; those are the right geographies; it\u2019s got a very bright future; and we're very comfortable with where we are in the DOJ process; and our timing has not changed on transaction.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Scott Schrier from Citi. Your question please.","Scott Schrier","Ward, first question I want to ask you is how are you seeing the FAST Act and how are customers looking at that versus waiting for more certainty from a federal bill. And the same goes for some of those state measures. When I think about the mid single digit increase in infrastructure volumes, it seems very positive. It seems like it\u2019s a step up from potentially how the conversation was growing in November when we spoke. So I'm just curious what\u2019s giving you the conviction given the softness that we\u2019ve seen that one that we\u2019re able to have that level of increase. And also to touch on what you talked about last quarter, where the big theme was inefficiencies at the state DOT level. Are you seeing some of those large gems making some progress to enable mid single digit and infrastructure growth?","Ward Nye","I guess the couple of things that I would say. Number one, I think if we generally spoke to people who are looking at their businesses at a granular level back in October and November. And so how do you feel then and how do you feel now. I think generally speaking people feel better today than they did then. And your question is why, I think for several reasons. One if we talk to our customers and we're talking to contractors, the level of work that they have and what they see ahead of them is encouraging to them. And if it\u2019s encouraging to them and they are talking to us about supply, it\u2019s encouraging to us. So we're hearing that from third party.","Number two, if we\u2019re simply looking at what we have in our backlog. And so if we're looking at our ready mix business in Texas today, for example, we have ready mix backlogs in Texas that are higher than any point since we\u2019ve own that business. And remember we picked up the vast majority of that with the TXI transaction several years ago, so that what we\u2019re seeing there, it\u2019s attractive. The other piece of it has been the conversations that we've had with different BOTs around the country because they recognized that they had initial.","So one of the conversations that I had with the secretary of transportation of southern state went along the lines of, look, I\u2019ve got a high class problem, I\u2019ve got $2 billion worth of work that I need to get out and the governor wants me to get that out and the legislation wants me to be get that out, and by the way I want to get that out. And one of the ways that they are dealing with that and here is part of the change that we\u2019ve seen, Scott, is they\u2019re dealing more with third party architects and engineering firms.","So to the extent that BOT have had issues hiring or re-staffing up they are using resources in a much more constructive fashion now than they ever have in the past. And the fact is that\u2019s probably a pretty good model for them, because it lets them control their internal costs, it lets them put out a good specification product. But again I think what we will see and what we started to see in portions of Q4, we're starting to see those projects release and simply seeing those projects release I think is one reason that you\u2019re seeing a better feel and a better tone from people in our business and our customers. I hope that helps.","Scott Schrier","And then for the quarter, looking at the margins, which were obviously strong I know optically strong price and declining volumes makes incrementals look inflated. But can you speak to any cost control or anything else that you may have achieved in the quarter that seem to drive that operational performance and is that something that we should see going into the future?","Ward Nye","Well, I guess, there are couple of things that happened there. Did we have good pricing? We did. Did we have good cost control? We did. And did we put some more inventories in the ground anticipating a busy 2018? We did some of that too. I don\u2019t want to completely overshadow the fine performance that the team did. But I would highlight there were some inventory builds out there. But the majority of it was the pricing and what we\u2019re doing from an efficiency perspective, but it should have that one off. I mean, you had incrementals with 100 in front of it. And that\u2019s not usual for Q4. But still, it was the performance that we are justifiably very proud of.","Scott Schrier","And one last one on cement, the guidance looks like at the midpoint, it\u2019s quite year-on-year increasing gross profit. Just seem if you could parse out potential your different market and the drivers whether it\u2019s the volumes and pricing, obviously you did a good job holding it and how you\u2019re thinking about the cement business more granular in Texas? Thanks.","Ward Nye","Keep in mind, we are the cement volume leader in Texas and we\u2019ve got plants there, so one in Midlothian North Texas, one at Hunter just outside of San Antonio. I guess the couple of things, one we saw a good finish to 2017. We think that really set the stage for a positive 2018. Q4 volumes are positive in both north and South Texas and we have an expectation that we\u2019ll see volume and pricing increases in 2018 as well. We think there continue to be very strong underlying economic conditions in that state. We think we\u2019re going to see better DOT this year, I mean we\u2019re seeing that DOT delta up from a 6 to last year up to 79 this year, so that\u2019s $1.7 billion more just in that all by itself.","We also have a new yard in New Caney outside Houston. We also have some material we\u2019re going to be supplying a little bit in Western Texas, as well. And really that\u2019s more focused just on the south end of it. We also think what we\u2019re going to see in North Texas this year is going to be a very exciting, very full, very dynamic market. So as we\u2019re looking at that marketplace with more volumes and we\u2019re looking for some price increases there that they\u2019re probably going to be around that $6 a ton range, probably a little bit better in the north than it is for the south. And you take those and put them together, we think it\u2019s going to be a pretty attractive place.","The other thing that I\u2019ll bring your attention to is if you look at our share by quarter in 2017, we had 21.4% in Q1, 20.9% into 19.1% in Q3, that\u2019s when we spoke last and 20.2% by year-end. And you started seeing this capture some of the share that we had lost in many respects, because we have been resilient on pricing. We think our strategy is working in that marketplace and we will continue to be very thoughtful about how we capture a bit more share than the overall Texas marketplace. But Scott helpfully that gives you a good drive by on what we see in Texas cement.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Jerry Revich","Ward, can you talk us about what you're seeing for your shale related shipments, how did the year end up, what's your anticipation of the ramp in '18 for that part of the business as you speak to your customers. And can you just calibrate us on a run rate basis, how diversified is this business is by shale play?","Ward Nye","Happy to do that Jerry. And what I would say is the shale finished up nicely at the end of the year. I gave you some numbers. These are probably a bit surprisingly. Our volumes to shale in Q4 were up 43%. If we look to the full year, they were up 24%. We think that\u2019s a positive outlook for 2018, particularly as we see the WTI state nicely above $50 on a per barrel price. Again, obviously, what we're seeing lately is around $61, we think that continues to drive people toward greater energy efficient or energy related jobs.","Here\u2019s what are those Jerry, if you go back overtime, what that means is in 2017 we sold almost 1.8 million tons to different shale plays. And when I say that, we sold some in Niobrara, we sold some in Marcellus, we sold some into Barnet, Eagle Ford, Avard and Haynesville for let\u2019s call it total 1.8, which doesn\u2019t sound bad until you go back overtime and say what does that look like in 2014 that was the peak. We sold almost 7.5 million tons to those same different plays in 2014. So 1.8 in '17 versus what was about 7.5 in 2014. And look do I think 7.5 is a normalized run rate, short answer is no. But do I think a normal shale demand should be in that three to four million ton range or 50% higher than we are today, I do think that\u2019s probably a pretty realistic outlook for it. I'm not saying that\u2019s going to be the outlook for this year, but I'm saying as we look at non-res numbers that should continue to grow for us. This is certainly going to be a piece of it and we're still at places that we feel like in shale are quite low, so I appreciate your question on that, because that is the big delta from where it was several years ago to where it was last year even though last year was better.","Jerry Revich","And Ward just the cadence so you mentioned you're exiting the year up 43% year-over-year in this business the comps should be equally easy through the first half of the year. So I know we're talking about the small numbers here. But is that the ramp that you expect based on what you're hearing from your customers similar through the first half of the year in that mid 40s exit rate?","Ward Nye","I think you could certainly see that type of building, and I would expect more of that to start in Q2 simply because of the weather issue that are inherent in Q1. And keep in mind, if you're selling into our Marcellus or Niobrara, that\u2019s a very different Q1 than is Eagle Ford, for example. So I think a lot of its going to depend on where. But I will say this from a percentage prospective the three areas that did get the most better in Q4 would have been Barnet at 38% up, Eagle Ford at 130% and Haynesville at 51% up. So that gives you a snapshot of at least where the action is and hopefully what the time we're looking feel like.","Jerry Revich","And then separately from a pricing standpoint, I know we\u2019ve got moving piece in terms of which regions are driving growth for you folks in '18 versus '17. As you look across your markets, how do you expect the magnitude of price increases on January 1st and April 1st of this year and compare to what you saw last year and any differences in terms of parts of the footprint where you\u2019re going earlier or later in construction season with your planned price increases this year.","Ward Nye","You know what, it varies at lot Jerry. And I\u2019d rather not go into very specific markets and talk about dollars and cents on any given market, but here what I\u2019ll say. Clearly, there are some markets that will see increases and have seen increases on January 1st. There are others that will go as late as April 1st. So we\u2019re not seeing things past April 1st. The one thing that\u2019s work reflecting on and I mentioned early in the conversations some of the diesel costs. Diesel in a rising cost circumstance has clearly been something that has continued to at least pop-up in past what has been some with your price increases, we\u2019ll have to see how the year shapes out on that and have to see what happens with diesel. But again from a pricing perspective, many in January some in March a few in April is the way that I would encourage you think about that, Jerry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Ng with Jefferies. Your question please.","Philip Ng","Based on your guidance it appears incremental margins for aggregate business is going to be little lower than that 60% historical run rate. Just curious how to that is mix in diesel. And do you expect that incremental margin profile to return back to 60% level in 2019?","Ward Nye","I think the big issue there is going to be on the where. So if we go back to the guidance and really think about what\u2019s in the guidance itself and how it rolls up, I mean if we\u2019re looking at the low end of that guidance what the low end of that guidance would assume is that you\u2019ve got flat Mid-Atlantic volumes and Southeast just up mid-single-digit versus our forecast of high mid-single-digits. So the short answer is if you\u2019ve got Virginia and North Carolina and South Carolina going at greater rates than that, it\u2019s clearly going to be a friend to the incremental margins.","So it\u2019s really going to be more of a story on the where. And one of the nice -- actually, the Secretary of Transportation here in North Carolina who I was referring to a little while ago, who is got the high class problem of having several billion dollars worth of work that he needs to get out the door. So we\u2019re serving hoping that we see that. We have necessarily built a budget around that. But to give you a sense of it that\u2019s really more your driver than anything else, because those are obviously our highest price, highest margin areas that we think have very bright futures. We\u2019re a little bit cautious right now on exactly when that future shows up, but we like what we see.","Philip Ng","And then public spending remains weak, here\u2019s the budget delays we\u2019ve seen had any impact in the fourth quarter, and you\u2019re expecting remain an overhang in 1Q and any risk in terms of impact in the peak construction season this year?","Ward Nye","I don\u2019t see a big risk on the construction season this year. Again, I think it\u2019s important to go back the answer I\u2019ve given a little while ago relative to the cadence, because I do think historically people have tended to put more weight on a Q1 than Q1 really deserves. As I said really since last couple of weeks in March that at least in the 20 plus years that I\u2019ve been around this industry tend to even make the quarter work or not, and I would just take to make a year back based on the last two weeks in March. I don\u2019t see anything relative to state budgets or the federal budget that gives us any notable concern as we\u2019re looking at. What we believe the construction season is going to look like when there is seasonal rise in earnest.","Philip Ng","And just one last one for me, you seem pretty constructive on a potential infrastructure bill. But just curious if you have any better line of sight on the funding aspect. And it appears to be a bigger reliance on the state level side of things from the funding standpoint. And lastly, is it your view that $200 billion federal funding piece will be incremental to FAST Act? Thanks.","Ward Nye","Its couple of things, I\u2019ll start with your last question first. So I think everything that we\u2019ve seen in the Trump infrastructure package is intended to be incremental. So there is not anything coming from what's already there to what\u2019s going with this. I think several things are underway. I think the Trump proposal candidly starts the conversation relative to funding and financing. And I think that\u2019s important thing to remember. I think we\u2019re going to have to watch what comes out of congress relative to the funding piece in particular.","So for example Chamber of Commerce is looking for $0.25 gas tax over five years, the American Trucking Association is looking for $0.20 over full year. And the reason that matters is you get $1.7 billion per penny so that\u2019s clearly the easiest way to do that, and the quickest way to do it. The other thing that we need to keep in mind is there are host of different proposals that are still being discussed in congress. I think we're going to see this congress come forward with something that\u2019s going to be in near term fix to really how we\u2019re going to enhance infrastructure spending. But I think they are also going to want to address longer term what the pay force look like. That\u2019s number one on what we see coming from this infrastructure act.","The other piece that I think is really at the moment is what happens from a regulatory prospective, because that\u2019s really going to be the place that you can see the game change pretty notably. Here is another anecdote for you. In talking to Secretary of Transportation again at the state level, I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s not all unusual for getting projects to take 10 years to go through the normal regulatory environmental permitting process. So when we're listening to the news conference yesterday and the aim is to get it down to two years, that\u2019s almost revolution, I mean, that changes the way that that\u2019s going to work in a pretty notable way.","And what I liked about what we\u2019re seeing is the proposal doesn\u2019t just say look we want to make it two years, it\u2019s starts calling for very specific changes. So for example, the plan is its proposed for most EPA from wetlands permitting process and lease it solely with the Army Corp of Engineers. Similarly, it\u2019s looking at different proposals under the Clean Air Act, and it\u2019s basically saying look if you're trying to get this type of permitting done and you\u2019re having to look at National Ambient Air Quality Standards that have been placed for a long time, really what you need start doing is just be focused on the newest regulatory standards that have been put in place and not going by the historic once that have been there.","In other words, the Trump infrastructure plan relative to what's going on relative to funding and financing has a lot of conversation to go, but there is not as much conversation that\u2019s ahead of us relative to the regulatory piece of it. And I will suggest to you in the near term, regulatory is almost more important than the dollars. The dollars will come, we're confident of that that. But again, as we look and contemplate what this is going to mean to us, the funding is one, the financing is another but the regulatory is really a big deal we think in the near term. So I hope that helped.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your question please.","Adam Thalhimer","With regards to the infrastructure up mid single-digits this year, Ward. Do you think that\u2019s more back half weight or do you think that if that picks up along with the normal construction season in March?","Ward Nye","What I think it probably picks up with the normal construction season in March. I mean, if we just go through and look broadly at those big eight, those lead eight states we spoke of before, I mean TXDOT has a letting plan 7.9 billion this year versus 6.2 billion last year. I think we feel positive in Georgia as we feel like the House Bill $170 will start to again have much more notable effect. And we\u2019ve talked about the fact that North Carolina we believe has a positive outlook and we\u2019re seeing an accelerating letting schedule here. I think if we look at South Carolina and we say, they\u2019ve done something that really is not typical for South Carolina, they raised their gas tax over a six-year period. I think we\u2019ll clearly start to see more work there, and Indiana has done the same thing.","And Florida is at a near record budget at $10 billion. And part of what we\u2019re liking in Colorado right now which has been just really strong robust pay force is we continue to see big jobs letting that state. And here\u2019s part of the difference that we\u2019re seeing there. These are big complication jobs that are going. So if we\u2019re looking at two large TIFIA projects and C-470 is one of them that\u2019s underway, and I-70 will start in 2018 and that\u2019s $1.7 billion worth of total investment. And part of the trick on those jobs is we think aggregates will be tight in that marketplace, and we think contractors are appropriately going to be focused on making sure they have aggregate suppliers and partners going into those jobs to actually meet their needs.","So again I think we\u2019re going to see a normal rhythm and cadence to it. I do think we need to get past March 15th, because in many states under DOT specifications, you can\u2019t even really go for more on those projects until then, which goes back Adam to the earlier comment that I have that often times as last two weeks in the first quarter oddly enough to make it or break it. So I think we see a fairly normal consistent rhythm and cadence to public work as we go into 2018.","Adam Thalhimer","And then just a quick follow-up, you talked about an elongated recovery in the U.S. I\u2019m just curious if there are any metro areas when you think we\u2019re more late cycle than early cycle?","Ward Nye","I\u2019ll tell you, I don\u2019t see many in our footprint that feel that way. And as we look at a lot of non-residential forecasting that comes out, I think most of them would continue to concur on that. If we look at the South and the Southeast, those areas continue to have expectations pretty heavy growth. About the only places that we see any degree of contraction at least from third-party forecasters are really in markets where we\u2019re not.","So we\u2019re seeing at least people forecast something that\u2019s going to feel a little bit more like a pull back in portions of the North Eastern United States. But again, if we\u2019re looking at those spaces that matter disproportionally to us, what I would suggest you is I don\u2019t see anybody who feels like their peaky and they are about to go over that peak and we continue to see a lot of cities and among them places like Atlanta and Raleigh and Charlotte and others that we think are still pretty early in the cycle. And as you know from falling us for years, those are cities that tend to be disproportionately important to us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stanley Elliott from Stifel. Your question please.","Stanley Elliott","Quick question, we\u2019re talking about the elongated cycle and certainly you guys got some benefit from the tax planned. Does it change how you think about leverage over the near-term? And I asked that post Bluegrass and the dead deal you're at looking at mid to high two sorts of level, which is very reasonable I think where we are. But I would love to hear your thoughts whether additional M&A, buybacks where you\u2019re heading that in terms of all that.","Jim Nickolas","Its Jim, I will take the question. There is no change to our capital priorities. So the right deal we\u2019ll move on that make sense, as has been the case for years. But as it relates your question around debt and its relative attract of this with the new tax law, it\u2019s obviously less attractive than it used to be, but it\u2019s still obviously more attractive than the equity issuances. So we really don\u2019t change too much from that perspective either. The tax law change does obviously give us more cash flow going forward and a greater ability to A, either delivery or B, pursue more acquisitions or share buybacks at the right point. So it just gives us more free cash flow to work with but I would say foundationally there is no difference in our approach to the capital allocation.","Stanley Elliott","And one housekeeping, on the cement pricing the $6. Is that -- are you assuming the midyear price increase in that or it\u2019s a market not requiring that at this point.","Ward Nye","We started talking last year about cement price increases. So we think we're pretty much set with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Bibb from CJS Securities. Your question please. ","Craig Bibb","Going back to aggregates margins for a second, you invested in capacity during 2017. And it sounds like you were building inventory in the third quarter and sold that through in fourth quarter. And I guess is that right..","Ward Nye","It\u2019s some in third, but there\u2019s some in four, yes.","Craig Bibb","And what is the -- how meaningful is that a benefit to gross margin in Q4?","Ward Nye","I guess, let's go back to the five first and we can go back what the margin look like. So I guess what I would tell you, if we look at it from a platform matter, Craig, there are parts in the Mid West in particular where we wanted to make sure we had adequate inventories on the ground, because cracking up in that corner of the world is bit of a challenge. So that\u2019s why you will go ahead and do that. But to your point, incremental is based on some of the inventory build or 100 plus percent -- I think probably would have been more in buy and maybe slightly ahead of our targets had we not done that. So you would have seen a very attractive incremental margin in Q4. The inventory just made it look phenomenally attractive, so just in the spirit of transparency.","Craig Bibb","And then which markets are construction labor constrained.","Ward Nye","Well, I guess what I would say is this. I want to say unemployment in parts of Indianapolis is about 1.8% typically people would say 2% its full employment. So that\u2019s pretty constrained right now. But here is the issue that we\u2019re running into we're not constraint from our perspective. In some instances it\u2019s contractors have been constrained in some markets, but the observation that I would make to you is this Craig. When contractors need to move on jobs either because they\u2019re concerned about liquidated damages or they want to get an incentive bonus for finishing early, my observation is they are able to meet those deadlines when they need to.","I think contractors the more we see talk and the more we see action on an enhanced infrastructure project, I think they can hire in these markets. So I think in many respects they have chosen not to higher in these markets. And I think as we come into 2018, they\u2019re going to be able to meet what the demand is and probably start positioning themselves for what we\u2019ve indicated we believe is going to be an extended cycle.","Craig Bibb","Are your issues with CSX solved?","Ward Nye","CSX is working their way through what has been an extraordinary period of time. So, I clearly had a change in CEOs twice, one with Michael Ward\u2019s retirement and then, sadly, with the death of Hunter Harrison. They clearly have had a change in their strategy. They went from really largely unit trains to more precision railroading, which means in their terminology, manifest service. I mean what that meant for portions of last year again in the spirit of transparency, they did have some longer cycle times. They did struggle at times with rail congestion. And I think on occasion they were resource limited.","What I would tell you is we have had very constructive conversations with CSX. They have been good partners to us and continue to be good partners to us. And we\u2019re seeing their performance improve over the last several months in terms of cycle times and fulfillment. So I am going to tell you that it\u2019s perfect, exactly the way we would like to see it? No, I don\u2019t think I can say that. Can I tell you that it\u2019s considerably better, I can. And can I affirm to you that we expected to continue to get better through the year? Yes. And have we, in many respects, built those notions into what we put out as our guidance? Yes, we have as well.","Craig Bibb","And you\u2019ve been talking for a little bit about, specifically North Carolina\u2019s ability to actually get work let, the transition they\u2019re undergoing. Are you seeing the work being let yet, or is it still two or three months out?","Ward Nye","I think we\u2019re seeing that improve circumstance in North Carolina and my expectation is based on some of the dialogue that we\u2019ll continue to get better. We\u2019re going to bring a little bit of show me to North Carolina, we\u2019re going to -- or Missouri to North Carolina, we\u2019re going to wait for a little bit more show on that. But right now, the outlook is good. North Carolina has a very good secretary of transportation and he\u2019s a visionary thoughtful leader. And I think he will do great things with DOT in the state.","Craig Bibb","Well, congratulations on world-class safety and $1 billion in EBITDA on the same year.","Ward Nye","Craig, we\u2019ll take both of those. Actually, Craig, here\u2019s the funny thing. If somebody had said to you last year, Hey, Martin Marietta is going to be down million tons year-over-year and they\u2019re going to hit $1 billion, you probably wouldn\u2019t taken that bet. I really have to give a shout out to our team they did a fantastic job and thank you for your comments.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Garik Shmois from Longbow Research. Your question please.","Garik Shmois","I just want to calibrate my modeling on incremental margins as we move through 2018. Ward, if I heard you right, with some of the inventory build in Q4 and assuming normal seasonality, is it fair to assume just Q1 incrementals will be potentially meaningfully although your full year guidance to then incremnetals as you move through, I mean the construction season is going to be above the full year guidance than maybe even looking closer to that traditional 60% range that you hit?","Ward Nye","That\u2019s certainly the right way to think about that. I mean, I would never expect in the normal circumstance with the normal January and February and early March to have the types of incrementals that we\u2019ev talked about through a cycle across the enterprise. So the short answer is yes. I think you should typically expect to see a build on those through the year. In a normal time what I would tell you is you should typically expect to probably see them peak in late Q3 or early Q4.","And part of what happened this year Garik is candidly, October showed up in November. I think the short answer is I think a lot of people were looking at a wet October, which is usually the busiest month of the year in the aggregates industry. And it wasn\u2019t because the weather and then November ended up being a very strong November. So yes, the way you\u2019re thinking about incremental is the right way.","Garik Shmois","And then just one question on cement. Are you seeing any trend of imports just bleeding your way from the Huston market to Central Texas or North Texas, would there be any potential impacts to your pricing guidance if that was the case?","Ward Nye","We're not seeing anything notable that happened -- that's happening in that respect certainly, not in North Texas. Obviously, you\u2019ve get some activity at the port in Huston and in South Texas. But again, the competitive issues that are underlying in that state have all been taken into account and the forecast that we put out here.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Ward Nye, Chairman, President and CEO for any further remarks.","Ward Nye","Thank you again for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. Our team's disciplined execution of our strategic plan and demonstrated record performance continue to provide a firm foundation to enhancing long-term shareholder value and underscores our confidence in Martin Marietta long term outlook. We very much look forward to discussing our first quarter 2018 results in April. Until then, thank you for your time and your continued support of Martin Marietta.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Howard Nye, President and CEO. You may begin.","Howard Nye - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining this Martin Marietta Materials\u2019 quarterly earnings call. With me today is Anne Lloyd, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are pleased to discuss our third quarter 2012 results as well as our full year expectations. We\u2019ll also share our preliminary view of the macro indicators for our aggregates product line end use markets in 2013.","As an initial reminder, this discussion may include forward-looking statements as defined by Securities laws in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results to differ materially. Except as legally required, we undertake no obligation publicly to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether resulting from new information, future developments or otherwise.","We refer you to the legal disclaimers contained in our press release relating to our third quarter 2012 results and to our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on the SEC's website. Finally, any margin references in our discussion are based on net sales, excluding freight and delivery revenues. These and other non-GAAP measures are also explained in our SEC filings.","Third earnings per diluted share of $1.36 exceeded the consensus by $0.10 and represented an improvement of 27% over the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by a 4.1% increase in heritage aggregates product line pricing and the contribution from our acquired operations in the Denver, Colorado market. Additionally, our Specialty Products business posted record third quarter earnings from operations.","For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased more than 20% primarily attributable to our Denver area businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011. In fact, our West Group had $300 million of third quarter net sales with 30% attributable to our Denver acquisitions. We continue to see indications of increasing construction activity in the Denver market, including the rate of growth in highway contract awards and construction related employment, both of which exceed national averages.","Quarterly net sales were also positively affected by the continuation of strong pricing trends as evidenced by the average selling price increase in our heritage aggregates product line. Pricing growth was reported in each of our groups led by a 5.1% increase in the Southeast Group aided by favorable product mix. The West Group\u2019s 4.8% price increase was the result of increased shipments to the energy sector. Finally, our Mideast Group reported a 3.5% increase in heritage pricing with growth in North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.","We see these positive trends in our business despite the current economic uncertainty, which first arose in June of this year and has continued to negatively affect demand. Accordingly, aggregates product line shipments decreased 3.8% in the quarter. Geographically, our Mideast and West Groups experienced shipment declines of 2.6% and 2.3% respectively, while our Southeast Group reported a 10.7% reduction as economic growth in this region still lags national trends. The infrastructure market continues to account for more than half of our business and shipments to this end use sector declined 6% compared with the prior year quarter. The passage of the moving ahead for progress in the 21st Century or MAP-21 ended a 3-year period in which states were hesitant to commit to long-term capital projects due to funding uncertainty. States can now confidently utilize MAP-21 dollars as well as other funding options to support vital infrastructure projects. Although July\u2019s passage of MAP-21 was too late to provide a demand boost in the current construction season, we believe it should provide momentum into 2013.","In addition to MAP-21 another positive sign for infrastructure activity is the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act also known as TIFIA. TIFIA applications now exceed $27 billion and span 11 states. Notably, several key Martin Marietta states specifically Texas and North Carolina have now applied for TIFIA funding assistance on identified large multi-year projects. To put this in some context, thus far Texas alone has put forward potential TIFIA projects with investments exceeding $6 billion. A further significance, the timing of these proposed TIFIA projects actually coincides with fiscal year 2013\u2019s more than doubling of Texas\u2019 traditional Department of Transportation spending. Two other key states Iowa and Florida have also initiated strong state level programs to finance major projects. As mentioned earlier while these factors provide some momentum heading into 2013, our full year 2012 infrastructure end use market volumes are expected to be down slightly.","The non-residential market, our second largest end use continued to enjoy quarterly growth in energy sector shipments. Our South Texas market has been the primary beneficiary of this energy related activity. Their third quarter volumes were up 49%. In fact South Texas is the only market reporting increased volume in each month of 2012. Other markets have continued to manage their way through erratic month-to-month shipment levels, driven largely by sporadic commercial construction activity. Many developers are simply hesitant to begin new projects given the current economic and political uncertainty. Overall, heritage shipments to the non-residential end use were flat compared with the prior year quarter. For the full year, we expect 2012 heritage aggregates product line shipments to the non-residential market to increase in the high-single digits.","Heritage aggregates product line shipments to the residential end use market grew 14% over the prior year quarter reflecting increased housing starts. For the full year, we expect shipments to this end use market to have a higher rate of growth compared with that of 2011. Although the residential market is recovering, it nonetheless remains depressed compared to historical averages. Still, September\u2019s seasonally adjusted annual housing start rate of 872,000 marked the first time that number had exceeded 800,000 since September of 2008. To complete our end use market discussion ChemRock and Rail experienced a 14% reduction of the heritage aggregates product line shipments. Declining coal traffic and the comparison with an unusually strong 2011 third quarter tied to Midwestern flood repairs were the primary divers of this reduction. For the full year, we expect heritage ChemRock and Rail shipments to decline by high-single digits.","For the quarter we\u2019ve reduced heritage aggregates product line production to match shipment levels. As a result heritage aggregates product line direct production cost declined 2.7% compared with the prior year quarter. Reductions in both personnel and repair costs allowed us to hold the increase in heritage aggregates product line costs per ton to 1%. In fact on a per ton basis our third quarter 2012 personnel costs were the lowest in four years. I am extremely proud of the accomplishments of our operating team in managing this critical cost component. Other than personnel, energy is the largest piece of our direct production cost. For the quarter we paid diesel fuel costs averaging $3.08 per gallon compared with an even $3 per gallon in the prior year quarter.","Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 22.9%. Excluding the effect of acquired businesses, our consolidated gross margin would have been 25.6%, an increase of 50 basis points over the prior year quarter. Of note, our Mideast Group, which is not affected by vertical integration, leveraged an increase in net sales and cost control to expand its gross margin by 180 basis points.","Our Specialty Products business repeatedly makes significant contributions to our quarterly performance. Strong demand for both chemical and dolomitic lime products generated net sales of $49.4 million. From a cost perspective, this business effectively leveraged lower-priced natural gas and generated earnings from operations of $17 million, a third quarter record. This result represents a 350 basis point increase in operating margin over the prior year quarter.","I am also pleased to report that the construction of our new dolomitic lime kiln in Woodville, Ohio has been substantially completed on budget, ahead of schedule, and already producing line. The customary debugging process is underway, but we expect this new kiln to generate net sales in the fourth quarter and ongoing anticipate incremental annual net sales of $22 million to $25 million with margins comparable to existing operations.","We continue to focus on selling, general and administrative or SG&A costs. For the quarter, SG&A expenses represented 6% of our net sales, a 140 basis point reduction compared with the comparable prior year period. We incurred approximately $1 million in cost during the quarter relating to our planned information systems software upgrade. This initiative has a total budgeted cost of $8 million and is expected to be complete in 2013. We believe our information systems continue to be industry leading and provide us with a great resource to perpetuate our outstanding cost management.","Consolidated earnings from operations for the quarter were $91.1 million compared with $80 million in the prior year quarter. For the first nine months of the year, cash provided by operating activities, excluding the impact of business development expenses, was $160 million. Days sales outstanding was 45 days comparable with 2011. Including the $32 million for the new lime kiln, we invested $106 million in various capital initiatives through the third quarter. We also maintained our quarterly dividend rate of $0.40 per common share.","At September 30, 2012, our ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA was 3.58 times compliant with the limits under our debt covenant. We recently amended this covenant to provide incremental liquidity cushion. As amended, the debt covenant limit remains at 3.75 times through June 30, 2013. The limit will then return to 3.5 times beginning September 30, 2013.","For the full year 2012, we expect heritage aggregates product line volume to increase 1% to 2%, pricing to increase 2% to 4%, and direct production cost per ton to increase slightly. SG&A expenses, exclusive of the incremental expense for our Denver operations and costs related for our information systems upgrade, are expected to decline slightly compared with 2011.","Earnings for our Specialty Products segment are expected to range from $68 million to $70 million. We expect interest expense to be approximately $5 million less than in 2011. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% inclusive of discrete events and capital expenditures are forecast at $155 million.","To conclude, we are encouraged by our future prospects and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on increased construction activity, as funding stability returns. Looking ahead to 2013, we have started to frame our preliminary view of the macro indicators affecting our end use markets. Our preliminary view assumes the U.S. Congress will resolve budget issues and additional or automatic budget cuts through the sequestration process will not occur.","Given that assumption, we expect the infrastructure end use market to increase in the mid-single digits driven by the impact of MAP-21, TIFIA and states sponsored programs. Alone TIFIA\u2019s potential $50 billion impact exceeds the total stimulus dollars awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We anticipate our non-residential end use market to increase in the high-single digits. We believe the residential end use market will experience double-digit volume growth. Finally, we expect our ChemRock and Rail end use market will be flat compared with 2012. We remain confident that our disciplined operating approach will deliver results enhancing long-term shareholder value. Thanks very much for your interest in Martin Marietta Materials. The operator will now give the required instructions. We\u2019ll be happy to address your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Arnie Ursaner of CJS Securities. Your line is open.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Hi. Good afternoon Ward and good afternoon Anne. Can you comment on the factors that are driving the margin improvement in your heritage aggregate operation and how we should think about it or your expectations for that on a go forward basis?","Howard Nye","And Arnie really there are three drivers that are doing that right now. If you take a look at it it\u2019s going to be pricing which was actually nicely up for the quarter. Again pretty close to the 4% up despite volumes that are down almost that same percentage. I\u2019m really pleased with what we\u2019ve done on cost control. Arnie, if we take a look at the costs that we have if I would look at labor, energy, M&R go through the entire list the only place that I saw anything that was negative was really in supplies and that was largely driven by energy in other words rubber, conveyer belt and tires, etcetera. So, as I look at pricing it\u2019s in the right direction as I look at cost control we talked about I think this was the lowest cost per ton on personnel we had seen in four years and what all that adds up to is what we see in productivity. If I\u2019m looking at our tons produced per working man hour and that\u2019s the primary productivity metric that we\u2019ll use. That was up over 4% for the quarter so I think what I would tell you is our teams are watching the business from a very fundamental perspective and they are executing well and I think that execution as well as pricing is what\u2019s driving that up margin expansion that you\u2019re seeing.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","And you spoke to volume improvement for next year if that word will occur what\u2019s your view of that could impact your margin on a go forward basis?","Howard Nye","Arnie that\u2019s the beauty we\u2019re seeing right now when you can see what price is doing to this cost basis right now. Yeah I think if we end up putting any degree of volume to this business I think what you can see is its going drop to the bottom line in very significant percentages and that\u2019s how we get to the incremental margins that we discussed. Again volume coming back and volume coming back across the enterprise is what\u2019s important to that. But I think if the macro indicators that we\u2019ve talked about are right it\u2019s going to be one of those few times I think in a career when we can say we\u2019re seeing infrastructure res and non-res all moving up at the same time and it\u2019s hard as it is that hasn\u2019t happened that often and next year might be one of those years.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","And you spoke very specifically about the demand in Denver market could you speak to integration and what you\u2019ve called the modernizing opportunities see in Denver and where are we in the process?","Howard Nye","We are working our way through the process. We feel like as we\u2019ve come into 2013 we\u2019ll really have that process where we want to see it. Obviously that\u2019s a significant transaction for us. It\u2019s a vertically integrated marketplace in which we\u2019re operating there. So we feel that we\u2019re entirely where we thought we would be with respect to integration. The business is performing frankly ahead of our expectations and separate and apart from what we\u2019re doing internally to the business I\u2019d like what I see in Denver. Before sitting here looking at that market I am looking at a 32% increase in highway demand there. We are watching commercial markets all of which are improving office, industrial and the retail sectors all have declining vacancy rates. Wage and salary growth in Denver is somewhere between 4.5% and 5% that\u2019s clearly better than the U.S. And you heard me speak in my prepared remarks to housing generally, but we\u2019re seeing single-family housing permits up in Denver 25%, we\u2019re seeing multi-family up there 40%. And we are seeing an increasingly high ability to participate in the Niobrara activity in that market as well. So, do we have some internal work to finish Martinizing the business? Absolutely. Will we be done by year end? We believe so. Is the business performing better than we thought? Yes. And do we like the way the markets behaving? The answer to that is yes as well.","Arnie Ursaner \u2013 CJS Securities","Thank you very much.","Howard Nye","Arnie thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research. Your line is open.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. You discussed a little bit in your prepared comments in the press release about your Texas outlook, but I was hoping if you go into perhaps a little bit more detail as related to your outlook for next year in terms of the overall budget and parsing out how much of the incremental upside is driven by TIFIA funding for infrastructure projects versus core budget or other bonding related projects?","Howard Nye","Kathryn, what I\u2019ll do, I\u2019ll speak to at least what we are seeing as far as spending is concerned in Texas. For next year, obviously, we\u2019ll give you much more detail on what we think will happen in that market when we come into 2013 and talk to you again in February. But what\u2019s nice about Texas right now, Kathryn is I think the biggest issue TXDOT has is really can they get out and spend all the money that they are talking about spending there this year. I mean the types of the numbers that we are seeing are in excess of $7 billion, and on occasion in excess of $8 billion. What I am encouraged by is probably several things. If you are looking at San Antonio right now, construction employment is up 7% in San Antonio, much of it\u2019s energy driven and we think we are in a good place there for that.","Multifamily is at \u2013 is near historic highs. Here is the factoid for you, between January and June, 9400 homes were sold in San Antonio, that\u2019s 500 more than they were in the prior year. And part of what we are seeing now is just a lot of subdivision work as well. That\u2019s clearly different. Even when we move from San Antonio to Huston, the best way to describe Houston is, Houston right now just looks back. I mean, it\u2019s at levels that are clearly pre-recession. Housing is tight in Houston though that\u2019s not a word you would use in much of the Southeast, but we are using in Southwest. Inventory and the housing there is around 4.9 months, that\u2019s the lowest since April 2002. And August year-on-year sales were up 20%, that\u2019s the fifteenth straight month of improvement there.","The only market that we are not seeing dramatic improvement in that respect is what we are seeing in North Texas right now, Kathryn, but even when we move to North Texas and keep in mind, they are not getting the energy tailwind that South Texas has. What we are seeing in North Texas from an infrastructure perspective is still pretty considerable. I mean, the DFW Connector is still underway, Interstate 635, which is the LBJ is underway, we\u2019ll go into not just next year, but at least through 2015. And we have got a number of jobs on the Southwest Parkway, which is really closer to Tarrant County and another series of jobs there as well. Keep in mind, even these numbers though that we are talking about in TXDOT that are $7 billion, $8 billion, that doesn\u2019t necessarily include the comprehensive development agreements in North Texas. So, I am trying to give you at least some factoids that you can look at Kathryn in building your model going forward. But as we are sitting here looking at what we think our 2013 DOT letting schedule could be in Texas, we are seeing a positive by around 130%.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Okay, great. Thank you. Maybe moving a little bit over to pricing and you gave some segmentations, in particular, the Southeast benefited from mix versus price increases, but on aggregate as a total, if you were to look just in rough percentages how much was the increased mix versus natural pricing increases in the market?","Howard Nye","Even the Southeast, the mix effect was only about 40 bps. So, it wasn\u2019t that profound. If we looked at it all-in, it was probably around 30 bps. So, what I would tell you is most of it is just genuine pricing, so it\u2019s not so much of mix effect.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","And speaking of pricing shipping over to your Denver market, Denver pricing as you\u2019ve talked about it has been lower versus your legacy products, and Martin\u2019s been making a concerted effort to push pricing out west. How are these efforts progressing? Is the market receptive in light of improved volumes to higher pricing? Any color you might give just on broadly speaking, not just specific pricing in the quarter in Denver, but higher efforts really play out as we look forward over the next 12 to 24 months?","Howard Nye","Right. Kathryn, if we are looking in an average selling price across the company of around 10.57, Denver is considerably lower than that. So, the fact is at least from where I said, yeah, there is considerably room there for that. And actually what I\u2019ll tell you is we have already put our pricing increases in that market, in aggregates, but we are also looking at price increases in ready-mix and across our products. And so far particularly with respect to what we are seeing in ready-mix, we think the biggest piece of price increases that we are putting out there will be sticking. And again I think if we go back to some of the data that I was sharing with Arnie in his first call is volume continues to comeback to that market. I think we will likely see pricing even grow in a more robust way.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","Do you think you will be able to be successful on changing the overall philosophy on pricing in that market, because it was a bit different than other markets that could you currently compete?","Howard Nye","The only thing that we can do is we can control what we do. I mean, we can look at our business and try to make the independent decisions that we think are the right decisions to make in that market and others. The thing that I like about Denver and what we have talked with you and others about is we want to be in markets where we can have a number one or number two position. And we think that does give us the ability to be a leader in that market and that\u2019s what we intend to do.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","And final question, what gives you the greatest concern about your preliminary guidance for next year and what gives you \u2013 what gives you confidence that those concerns maybe ill founded? Thank you.","Howard Nye","Kathryn, as I look at res, I feel pretty confident with that as I look at non-res on the heavy side uncomfortable with that. That\u2019s been so energy driven. As we look at that, that looks good and solid to me. It certainly seems to me that we should see the lighter side of non-res get some life. I think that\u2019s probably the space if you wanted to put some degree of risk out there that may have the highest degree of risk. But keep in mind by the time we get into next year, we will have had just about a year and a half pretty good housing numbers, and by then, you should start to see the office and retail portion pickup just a bit and go forward. Again, what we are talking that relative to ChemRock and Rail for next year is something that feels much more like up 3- to 5-year average. So, I feel relatively comfortable there and I hope that\u2019s responsive to your question.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research","That is. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to go back to Denver for a little bit, I was trying to understand though the full impact of that operation on the other companies\u2019 overall profile. And so can \u2013 and I understand the mix, but can you talk about what the contribution margin would be in the West segment going forward you think? And then you mentioned if there was going back to the question about Martinizing it, if there was any negative impact this quarter you think that you will be able to a quarter or two from now that would have been reversed as its fully Martinized so to speak?","Howard Nye","Well, let me give you some numbers, Adam. And I think this probably will lead you to what you are looking at in large part. There is $90 million in revenue in Denver. The best way to think about that is around half of that $90 million is going to be in some downstream form of business so either hot mix or ready-mix. And again from a hot mix perspective, when we bought that business in Denver we\u2019ve just about doubled our hot mix exposure. I want to say heritage business, usually around 1.3 million tons these last few years we\u2019ve picked up around 1.5 million tons in Denver. If you go back and look at our heritage business on ready-mix, usually that\u2019s going be somewhere between over the last several years 0.5 million cubic yards and 600,000 cubic yards, we are going be somewhere just north probably of 800,000 cubic yards in Denver in ready-mix. So, from that perspective, it is a different look there. I do think as we move forward with the balance of the integration, you will make a nice difference there. Keep in mind what we said was we have planned for the acquisition in Denver to be accretive in 2013. And that is still our plan to have that business accretive in 2013.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thank you. And then just secondly, I think it\u2019s been while since I have publicly heard anything, is there been any update you care to share with any plans to proceed or not proceed with Vulcan?","Howard Nye","Yeah, you are right it\u2019s been very quiet on that. And what I\u2019ll tell you is obviously we are focused on running our business and we are focused on creating shareholder value. And that\u2019s creating shareholder value through doing what we do organically and otherwise, that\u2019s what we are going to look at. And if we can create shareholder value by looking at acquisitions, we are going to look at acquisitions. So, for us, I think what our track record is, I think we look for continuous improvement and we look to grow our business in any number of ways. So, I know that\u2019s a relatively vague answer, but that\u2019s probably the best that I can do for you this time.","Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from Todd Vencil of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","","Hi, thanks very much. Good afternoon guys.","Howard Nye","Hi, Todd.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Big picture and then small picture, let\u2019s have big picture first, as you look at your outlook for 2013, I mean obviously that\u2019s a key item that everybody is focused on. You\u2019ve had a few questions about it. But can you talk a little bit about how you formulated that and where you are sort of \u2013 where you are looking at an order book, your level or your customers\u2019 level and where it\u2019s a little more sort of nebulous?","Howard Nye","Well, Todd, again, big picture I think that\u2019s really the way that we are looking at that right now is from a big picture. And again, we\u2019ll probably give you much more detail that you can really sink your teeth into coming February. But again if we are looking at sitting in a place with a highway build that we haven\u2019t done for years. I mean, Todd you\u2019ve heard me say we are now sitting in a spot from a forward-looking view perspective, we haven\u2019t been since 2007. And that as we\u2019ve at least got two years of knowing what we have had ahead of us. I think knowing that there is something that\u2019s solid with MAP-21 that states and others can count on we think is significant. Seeing what\u2019s coming in TIFIA, we also think is pretty significant. Again, if you take a look at what\u2019s going on relative to TIFIA in some of the markets that are moment to us, it\u2019s a pretty big deal. I mean, we have looked at 16, 17, almost 19 different projects that are out there. If you look at $27 billion worth of projects that had been bid so far, I said five of them in Texas, two in North Carolina, and that puts us in a spot that we feel like we can be more than competitive on more than $9 billion worth of that work.","If we look at some of the jobs that were out there in previous TIFIA submissions, but have not yet been resubmitted being some of those were in North Carolina, and specifically, the Garden Parkway near Charlotte, if we look at Texas, San Antonio Loop 1604 and State Highway 550 and the Valley are all jobs that we will be looking at in Florida I-75. So, again, if we are looking big picture and you are looking MAP-21 and you are looking at TIFIA, yeah I think those are pretty considerable. I can go through the rest of the buckets. And you assume that shale has been awfully good work for us this year in the energy sector. I\u2019ll let you draw your own conclusions on where do you see energy going, but clearly if you\u2019ve got infrastructure that\u2019s moving where we think it is, if you\u2019ve got energy that you think maybe pretty solid next year, if you\u2019ve got another good year of housing, yeah, I think those are the building blocks that leads you to at least some of the macro indicators that we\u2019ve put out there, Todd.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Great. Thanks for that color. Drilling down a little bit on the Denver market, you talked some about the downstream businesses, how are those businesses and again the non-aggregates, the paving and the asphalt and the ready-mix, how are those operating relative to what you would have expected? How is the demand, I assume the demand has come along pretty good based on some of your other comments, but how is that going in? And what does the profitability look like for those businesses, which ones you are making money and which ones are tougher?","Howard Nye","I mean, clearly downstream businesses tend to be tougher businesses in this type of market area. I think if you want to come back and say which ones look tougher and which ones look better, I think it\u2019s not a Denver issue, I think it\u2019s probably a U.S. issue to come back and say ready-mix is a tougher animal than anything else is today. At the same time, what I will tell you is what we are seeing relative to activity in that market is I see better than we thought it would be, Todd. Ready-mix was going to be driven disproportionately when things start building up. So when we start seeing that form of vertical construction that we are seeing now in Denver, that\u2019s a good sign. At the same time, the hot mix business in some markets has been pretty good this year, in other markets it struggled more. What I\u2019ll tell you is we\u2019re seeing a lot of project work in Denver. Through September we bid on 1,700 projects in that market I mean that\u2019s a lot. And we\u2019ve got a success rate on those projects that I won\u2019t give you that I do know but I won\u2019t give it to you. But I\u2019m pretty excited about the type of success right we have on those keeping in mind we want to have a leadership position, so we\u2019re bidding those projects very carefully and we\u2019re trying to be responsive in that market.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Right, good you\u2019re just teasing me on the success rate, by the way.","Howard Nye","Well.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Final question, thinking about the seasonality we haven\u2019t been through the full fourth quarter with these guys yet, any color on that I think about that I mean think about maybe if we compare to the first quarter, how should we think about the downstream activity there relative to what was on the first quarter?","Howard Nye","Well, that\u2019s a great question. And Todd, what I\u2019ll always tell you is the first quarter out there is always going be tough. I mean its January, February and March and what happens at the end of March is you\u2019re going to make or break that. Usually in most these places, October is going be pretty good month. I mean across the industry, October is usually the single biggest month that the industry sees. It\u2019s usually not horribly cold and it\u2019s usually relatively dry. So, I\u2019ll send you to the NOAA forecast to see what it looked like in the neighborhood near you. But I think if you look at what October is and you assume that in any of these cold markets, if you can have a good solid run up to Thanksgiving really that\u2019s doing pretty well. And anything you get after Thanksgiving it\u2019s almost gravy, so that\u2019s probably the best way to think about it.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","I\u2019ll got take a look at the NOAA forecast, but given that\u2019s it\u2019s now November any color on whether we might have had a good solid run so far as we approach Thanksgiving?","Howard Nye","Well, I\u2019ll tell you what Todd I\u2019ll say you all about that in February.","Todd Vencil \u2013 Sterne Agee","Alright. Thanks a lot Ward.","Howard Nye","Alright. Todd, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Kasprzak of BB&T. Your line is open.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone.","Howard Nye","How are you doing Jack?","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T","Doing fine. Thanks Ward. My first question is the volumes were down in Q3, I guess that led to bit of a reduction in volume guidance for the year. Sitting here today do we think that the really mild first quarter accelerated shipments and there just wasn\u2019t enough left in backlog for 2012 to maintain guidance?","Howard Nye","I think it did a number of things. So, I think the early start it probably rob a little bit from the back end of the year. I think that\u2019s there. I think the protracted process of MAP-21 and the uncertainty that came from that did a bit of a number on it as well. It\u2019s funny if you look at the first five months of the year Jack it was up 10%. If you look at June through September it was down 4%, I think there was a confidence issue somewhere in there as well. I think you had several things, I think you did have an early start to the year, but I do think the MAP-21 process and things relative around confidence was pretty tough. The other thing that I\u2019m sensitive to as I sit here as we head into the end of the year too is when I\u2019m talking with your at some point next year we\u2019re going have to dealing with what was pretty a tough comparable back in Q1. So, I\u2019m sitting here right now thinking it probably did do a little bit of harm to us in the later part of the year and then you and I will probably have another conversation along that line as we talk about Q1 next year.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T","Sure, that\u2019s good heads up for model building. On the subject of infrastructure if we go back in time and big highway always builds happen like 221 and people got excited and obviously the stimulus program which was a shot in your arm to infrastructure thought to be big a increment at the time probably not such a big increment and now we\u2019re looking at not just this MAP-21 program, but the TIFITA program which seems have generated some excitement, what\u2019s the chances that it\u2019s a bit of a disappointment and that there are offsets like we\u2019ve seen in the past and is there a chance that the money spend on larger projects and maybe less aggregates intensive?","Howard Nye","The only time I think you\u2019ll see money spent on larger projects will be less aggregate intensive is if you have a lot of bridge work. If there is a lot of bridge work it\u2019s going have a lot of concrete, it\u2019s going have cement. But it\u2019s not going have a lot of aggregates. I think what we\u2019re seeing and where we have certainly sense most of the pent up demand and what we\u2019re seeing in most TIFIA projects is adding some form of lane capacity. And I think when we come back and add lane capacity. That\u2019s going to be awfully important to us look. As I look at the big jobs that are out there right now that we are seeing in TIFIA. What I am seeing I-77 HOT lanes in Charlotte. I am seeing I-83 or State Highway 183 in Dallas. I am seeing State Highway 288 in Houston, 183 in Austin, again the Grand Parkway in Houston, Interstate 35 in Dallas. All of these are big lane addition projects. So, I think as we sit here and look at it, I think TIFIA from where I sit, Jack, I think it\u2019s going to be the real deal. And I think the other difference that we have relative to the underlying program is we have two years of knowing that we have something. I mean if we go back and look at the stimulus deal or others, you still had an environment which you are operating that didn\u2019t have any degree of consistency or forward view to it. Now, am I crazy about a 2-year forward view? Not as crazy as that would be about a 6-year forward view, but believe me it feels a lot better than 60 days.","Jack Kasprzak \u2013 BB&T","Sure. Certainly, part of their general uncertainty you were referring to. Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks a lot, Howard.","Howard Nye","Thanks, Jack.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, good afternoon.","Howard Nye","Jerry.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Howard, excellent pricing in the quarter, can you just talk about what surprise to the upside and presumably realizations were somewhat higher than you expected. Can you just give us some color?","Howard Nye","Yeah. I am not sure that they were all that higher really than expected. I mean, it was kind of right, and it was toward the upper end of the range that we thought it would be. As I said, it probably got a little bit of help candidly not an enormous amount of help from at least from the geography that was going on in South Texas going to the rail yards. And I mentioned around the 40 bps that helped a bit in the Southeast, but Jerry as I look here across our different areas of business what I am seeing is a lot of green. And part of what helped here too is we saw some pricing in Carolina. And you and I have talked about the fact that, that\u2019s a market that\u2019s awfully important to us. And when we are seeing pricing in South Texas and when we are seeing pricing in a place like Charlotte, it really helps and drops to the bottom line pretty quickly.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And I know seasonality can skew things in the fourth quarter, but you still have a pretty wide guidance range for pricing, I am wondering how you expect pricing on a year-over-year basis back up in the fourth quarter compared to what we just saw for the third?","Howard Nye","You know what I\u2019ll tell you more about that when we come in for the full year, but obviously given what our range is Jerry you\u2019ve got a pretty view for where that is. There is not much math left to the year.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Sure. And so you think about 2013 presumably you are having the Jan 1 price increase announcements with your customers give, if you\u2019ve sent that, any notices, can you just share with us on what you are targeting well for January 1?","Howard Nye","You know what, Jerry obviously, the prices that will go out are going to vary enormously by market. And what we may see in a market in one part of Texas or another part of Texas could swing dramatically. The same story could be in North Carolina. So, it\u2019s hard to come back and put any specifics to it, but obviously we are in the process of really finalizing a lot of that right now.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And lastly now that you\u2019ve had a couple of quarters with the Denver assets under your belt, can you just talk about how you expect the margin progression to compare versus the rest of the business over the next call it one to two years, if your volume forecast play out how do you expect margin expansion in the Denver assets to compare with the rest of the aggregates footprint?","Howard Nye","Sure, Jerry. I mean, clearly, we are going to have to look at that market on an integrated basis, because that\u2019s the way that market is built. And because it\u2019s built on more of an integrated basis, it\u2019s not going to have the same type of margin number at the end of the day that we have come to expect in a more pure-play market. From that perspective, will it lag other markets? I think that\u2019s entirely fair to say, because again you can\u2019t have that much hot mix and ready-mix and have that happened. At the same time, if we look at Denver and look at the currency that we used in River, what I\u2019ll tell you is Denver at peak was about 3x where River was in peak. And it all comes back to our notion that we are looking to be one or two in markets that we think have near-term and long-term attractive demographics to it and Denver falls entirely into that. And Denver is the market that when volume returns to that market will be very attractive to this economy.","Jerry Revich \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Howard Nye","Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Trey Grooms of Stephens. Your line is open.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens","Hi Howard and Ann.","Howard Nye","Great.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens","On \u201813, as we kind of look out there, historically you\u2019ve said and I think you\u2019ve touched on this again today that you would need to see kind of an improvement across the enterprise I guess kind of from geographic standpoint in order to see the kind of incremental margins you\u2019ve outlined for the business, but kind of looking into next year given your outlook would you expect some of these markets that seem to still be trying to kind of find bottom here would you expect to see them finally start to see demand improvement as well?","Howard Nye","Alight and again, just to be clear we\u2019re really just talking about the pure aggregates business. And Trey the markets that have suffered the most had clearly been the markets in the Southeast United States. And again we\u2019ll come back and talk with some degree of specificity around all of those. I think there are couple of things that are probably we\u2019re thinking about because if you really go back look at them some of the states in the Southeast are getting better. I mean from a housing perspective foreclosures in North Carolina have improved pretty considerably year-over-year. If you look at Georgia last year in August of \u201911 the percent of homes with mortgages somewhere in the foreclosure process was almost 3%, today it\u2019s around 2%. So, things are getting better in the Southeast. They are not great, but they are getting better. Here is what I would tell you though. There is the Southeast and then there is Florida. I mean Florida from a housing perspective is so much worse off than anybody else is. The percent of homes with mortgages and foreclosure in Florida last year in August was 12.1%. Its still today at almost 11% and to give you a sense of it when you go from Florida to whoever is next worst, in that case you come to New Jersey and New Jersey is at around 6.5%. So, there is still some tough slogging that people have to do in certain parts of the country. And if we\u2019re sitting here today, you still got one out of every 318 homes in Florida that are in some degree of foreclosure.","And to give you a sense, Georgia is down to one in 532, the U.S. rate is one out of every 730. So, there are some parts of our footprint that I think you and I would look at and say these are good markets, these are markets where you want to be, but they are some markets that still have some curing that they need go through. What\u2019s remarkable though and you know its right it only takes a little bit of volume just minimal volume to suddenly start getting very strong incremental returns. So and we joked about in the past and literally said there is nothing wrong with this business that 5 million tons doesn\u2019t cure. And the odd thing is if you and I were talking about 5 million tons back in 2006 it wouldn\u2019t have seemed like that much, today it seems like an enormous amount. But I hope that puts some metrics around what we\u2019re seeing in parts of our business particularly in the Southeast because really that\u2019s where it needs to get well. So, you can see the volume across the enterprise to really propel us to those incremental margins that we will see.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens","It\u2019s helpful. Well thanks and I guess one other question again kind of on the outlook. You just given kind of the scenario that you\u2019ve kind of laid out for us would you expect to see any kind of product mix impact to pricing next year just given if things shake out kind of the direction that\u2019s you\u2019ve been laid for us there?","Howard Nye","Right, I guess I would say a couple of things in that respect. Number one, remember Denver is going come in and it won\u2019t be acquisition next year, it\u2019s going to be heritage. So, when Denver pricing comes in that geographic mix is going to pull it down. The other thing that I would tell you is, let\u2019s face it. The big thing that\u2019s going on right now is housing, I mean so if we\u2019re looking at housing numbers August to August up 28% and that\u2019s a great number, but we\u2019re going to be a lagger going into that housing market as well, so we\u2019re not going to feel some of the pop from that. If we are seeing too though more of these TIFIA projects and I believe that we will. And if these TIFIA projects are building more new lane miles we\u2019re going to send more base out. And sending more base out is something that we as an organization will obviously celebrate because it\u2019s going to be more volume and we\u2019re producing base as we\u2019re producing a clean wash stone. But I think bringing Denver into heritage and seeing more base go out if you\u2019re having more new projects will give you at least somewhat of a mix effect that could optically book downward when downward is really not what you\u2019re seeing, I think on the same-quarry, same store, same product basis you won\u2019t see bad things happen. And I think that really is incumbent on us to make sure that we\u2019re explaining it very carefully. And as you recall that was the process that we had to go through couple of years ago as well.","Trey Grooms \u2013 Stephens","Thanks a lot, Ward. Very helpful, good luck.","Howard Nye","Take care, Trey.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garik Shmois of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Just a follow-up to Trey\u2019s previous question, you already mentioned that there could be some negative mix issues on pricing next year if you start shipping more base. But I was just wondering on the offset there presumably you\u2019re still working through some maybe a modest backlog of stimulus projects that when they come off perhaps could provide a positive mix effect. I was wondering if you can speak to that maybe provide some color on how many \u2013 what percentage of projects in your backlog are still are stimulus related?","Howard Nye","Garik, there is not going to be an enormous amount of stimulus work left particularly when we get to the end of the year. If you go back and look at that $26 billion-$27 billion, 21% of that work was done in 2009, around 43% in \u201910, around 22% last year. So, as we came into the year it\u2019s around $1.7 billion that was even left as we came into the year. So, I think it\u2019s a practical matter. You\u2019re not going to see much of an effect from that rolling off in our candor. I think the bigger issue on the mix will be how much is going on in the East versus how much is going on to the West and then how much is going on relative to brand new lane construction projects versus overlay.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay and I guess one more question on that with stimulus we did see an incrementally more competitive pricing environment, mix aside, you\u2019re still operating it fairly low utilization rates as is the industry relative to normal levels, is there any risk in your view that with some of these new big attractive projects coming on that the pricing environment could get incrementally more competitive as competitors chase additional volume?","Howard Nye","What I don\u2019t see Garik today is the sheer level of fear that I think was present in the minds of contractors and frankly others across the economy period that during the period of time that stimulus was really going. So, I see something in the economy today and then the space that is much more steady than it\u2019s been and my sense is that\u2019s not going to be a particularly big issue. The other thing that strikes me on much of these larger jobs, keep in mind these are going to be bid differently, you\u2019re going to start to see a bit of change in the way highway contracting works, because these large design build jobs usually are going to be built by a consortium of contractors who are coming forward to and relationships are going to matter here a lot. And a contractor recognizing on a job that may have an enormous liquidated damages if they don\u2019t turn it on time that they have a producer who can really put the material on the ground is going to be important. So, I\u2019ve seen an entirely different paradigm going into a TIFIA like world as opposed to what I saw going into a stimulus like world.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful and my last question is on the energy portion of your non-res business you\u2019ve seen good growth here in 2012 you\u2019ve provided an optimistic outlook going forward with declining rig counts, just wondering where your optimism is coming from and is it really coming from continued growth in Eagle Ford are you looking to expand your energy exposure just a little bit of color there will be helpful?","Howard Nye","Absolutely, we \u2013 Garik you\u2019re right I mean the drop I\u2019ve seen in rig counts the change from \u201812 is around 9%. But at the same time if I go back and look at the different shale plays in which we are involved, what we\u2019ve seen from a \u201811 to \u201812 in Niobrara is improvement, what we\u2019ve seen from a \u201811 to \u201812 in Barnett relatively stable. What we\u2019ve seen from a \u201811 to \u201812 in Eagle Ford is improvement, what we\u2019ve seen from \u201811 to \u201812 in Haynesville is actually down and what we\u2019ve seen in Marcellus is actually up. So, as we sit here and look at shale activity today I think we see a number that\u2019s nicely up over the last year. And I guess what I would suggest to you is if you look at the ones that are most impactful to us would in today\u2019s world be Niobrara and it would be Eagleford, and to a certain degree, what\u2019s going on in Haynesville and a growing role in Marcellus. I think those look pretty good going into the year. Remember the areas that you are going to see most of the growth can be the areas that you are getting gas and you are getting oil at the same time. And based on what we are seeing in particular in South Texas, we feel like that\u2019s going to be stable, and candidly, we are looking at ways to get into others this time as well.","Garik Shmois \u2013 Longbow Research","Okay, thanks so much.","Howard Nye","Sure, Garik.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","","Hi, guys. How are you doing?","Howard Nye","Hi, Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","I was hoping to come back to couple of the margin questions. Just to better understand in the core aggregates business, what was happening? And maybe as a starting point, I apologize if I missed it. I think Arnie\u2019s first question asked about some of the comments on your heritage profitability. Could you just reiterate what those were?","Howard Nye","I mean, what I addressed with Arnie on what some of the drivers were. I mean, clearly you had pricing that was helping in that respect. You had cost control that it actually taking cost up candidly a little bit less than 1% for the quarter, which we are pretty pleased with. And we were seeing tons produced per working man hour, up somewhere north of 4% for the quarter as well. So, those were the primary drivers Ted that I gone through with Arnie.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","And so did you speak to what the common heritage incrementals look like?","Howard Nye","Not, I don\u2019t think we spoke specifically to what those numbers look like, but I can tell you that there was growth in the heritage margin.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay. Because I guess when I go through the numbers, obviously you had volumes down a little bit and pricing will be tailwind, but you say that on a reported basis, you have a 6% incremental, which included $7 million of better pricing. So, in that note, profits were down about $1 million on an $88 million increase on profitability. I think this gives us some of the questions around to the impact that Denver, the downstream assets maybe very specifically that the paving business. But could you just help us understand you maybe bridge what happened to the underlying profitability of the business, because when we look at the reported numbers, the incremental pull-through probably was below people\u2019s expectations?","Howard Nye","I think if you look at the pricing strength, there was probably around $14 million of pricing strength that was there. If you look at the volume weakness, there was probably almost a similar number on the volume weakness as there was in the pricing. If you look at the decrease in production costs, that\u2019s probably going to get you somewhere north of $6 million. Yeah, I think if we go through and simply take a look at what the acquired locations were and otherwise, I can certainly take you through that bridge in some more detail, if you need to on later call, but I think that in large part is what\u2019s going to gets you there, Ted.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. But in terms of just understanding the profitability of the downstream businesses, could you speak directly to what those profits or losses look like for the asphalt, for the concrete, and for the paving business?","Howard Nye","We have not done that specifically Ted and obviously we\u2019ll come back and talk about some of that at year end, but as we said earlier on, an asphalt business in many respects is the very profitable or at least a good business in today\u2019s market. Our ready-mix concrete business is going to be a challenged market in any market in the United States today. So, you can certainly take that comment to be what you like it to be or wanted to be with respect to Denver or portions of Texas or Arkansas, and those are the three areas of which we would have ready-mix operations.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay. And the last thing I was just hoping to ask is your framework for 2013 was very helpful, but maybe even taking a step back and thinking let\u2019s just say over the next cycle. How would you just frame? How you think about the cycle-over-cycle potential? If we were to try to look back at prior up-cycle, do you think it will be fair to look for similar intensity of growth would be moderated by some of the leverage issues we are facing in the nation, but just any commentary there would be super helpful?","Howard Nye","I don\u2019t think anything is going to be dramatic from a growth perspective, but here is what\u2019s different. I don\u2019t think it has to be dramatic for to be dramatic to our business. I think where we are sitting with today\u2019s cost and with what we think tomorrow\u2019s pricing can be any degree of volume to this business today is incredibly powerful. As you and I discussed in the past, we are 80 million tons away from where we were at peak, and remarkably, if we recover half of that, we go past what our peak profitability was. And I think it\u2019s those types of metrics that tell you that we think it\u2019s going to be a very uneven at times March out of this. Yeah we do. Do we feel like that we\u2019ve seen the worst of it? Yeah, I think we do. Do we feel like any degree of volume is going to be powerful and very quickly drop to our bottom line? Certainly. And we feel like if we have growth across our geography are we going to find the incremental margins that we talked about, I think our confidence on that simply increases.","Ted Grace \u2013 Susquehanna","Yeah was that volume leverage I was trying to get that, so it\u2019s very helpful guys. Coagulations, good luck this quarter.","Howard Nye","Thanks a lot Ted.","Operator","Thank you. I am showing no questions in the queue at this time. I will hand the call back Mr. Nye for closing remarks.","Howard Nye - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks again for joining our third quarter 2012 call and for your interest in Martin Marietta. As we said we are encouraged by recent positive trends which should lead to increased construction activity in 2013 and beyond. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results with you in February. Thanks for your time today and for your continued support to Martin Marietta. Good day to all of you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference for today. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."]}}
