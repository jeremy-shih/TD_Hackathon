There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our press release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent forms -- report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Please note that we have not fully completed the tax provision calculation process and the tax provisions for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013, including the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction and income tax expense related to taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the intended repatriation, are still preliminary, and therefore, GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share for these periods are also preliminary. Final tax provisions, GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share will be included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, to be filed with the SEC, and may differ materially from what we discuss today.","VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our press release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter results capped a solid 2013 for VeriSign, in which we executed on our goals to protect, grow and manage the business. In 2013, we provided uninterrupted availability for the common net DNS, now for over 16 years. We processed 34 million new domain registrations and finished the year with 127.2 million names in the domain name base. We recorded strong 2013 financial performance, including 10% year-over-year revenue growth and $533 million in free cash flow. During the year, we repurchased 21 million shares for $1 billion.","As noted in our press release, we liquidated one of our domestic subsidiaries during the fourth quarter and plan to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return for a net tax benefit of approximately $375 million. Also, we intend to repatriate approximately $700 million to $800 million of offshore cash during the second or third quarter of this year. George will provide further details on the worthless stock deduction and plans for repatriating a portion of our offshore cash.","Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of 2013. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 4.1 million shares for $225 million. On January 31, 2014, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $528 million to a total of $1 billion in authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration.","We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","New generic top level domains were delegated into the root zone during Q4. While we admit we have been invited by ICANN to begin the contracting process for 12 of our 14 applications, VeriSign has not yet signed agreements for these gTLD applications. We will provide updates, as appropriate, regarding the status of our applications and the status of back-end registry customers.","Over the past few quarters, we've spoken about efforts in our area of innovation and intellectual property. We've made progress in both these areas and may see revenue from these efforts, as well as from new gTLDs and back-end Registry Services in 2014. However, based on current visibility, we're not including any such revenue in the 2014 revenue guidance George will be discussing in a few minutes.","Our NIA unit grew revenues, bookings and customers in 2013. I'll comment now on the fourth quarter and full year operating highlights. In our Naming business, at the end of December, the total base of active registered domain names in the zone for common net was 127.2 million, consisting of 112 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 5% year-over-year.","In the fourth quarter, we added 1.29 million net new names for the domain name base after processing 8.2 million new name registrations.","In the third quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 72.5% for the third quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2013 will be approximately 72.2%. This rate compares to 72.9% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012.","From the daily posting of the zone file through January, the first quarter incremental zone growth has been trending below last year's levels. While there are many factors that drive zone growth, there are a couple of items of note affecting the zone during this quarter. Recent changes to certain domestic and international registrar marketing tactic have had a near-term negative impact on the zones as these registrars are focused on increasing bundled product offerings rather than on driving domain name sales and have been running fewer discount programs on new domain. Also, we see some impacts from economic headwinds in emerging markets that are contributing to January's lower trend in zone growth. While it is too early to say for how long or how much these factors may affect zone growth, we currently see it impacting registrations in the first half of the year. But we expect net new names additions to return closer to last year's levels in the second half of the year. Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, the overall renewal rate has been softer, primarily due to the lower renewal rates for first-time renewing names. Given our forecast for zone growth, including the factors just discussed, we expect .com and .net names added to the zone in the first quarter of 2014 to be between 1 million and 1.5 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing the fourth quarter and full year financials, I would like to review with you the update on the worthless stock deduction and the repatriation noted in today's press release. As Jim mentioned, we liquidated, for tax purposes, one of our domestic subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of 2013, which will allow us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return. We recorded a net income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2013 of approximately $375 million related to the worthless stock deduction, net of valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions. VeriSign also sold certain cost method investments during the fourth quarter of 2013 and realized a pre-tax nonoperating gain of $15.8 million on this disposition. Additional information regarding this liquidation and the benefit is contained in today's press release.","As with any tax filing, the worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the IRS. If the IRS rejects or reduces the amount of the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction, we may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which could adversely affect our results from operation, financial position and cash flow. Further, we cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of benefit we receive will be, if any, if the deduction is reviewed and adjusted by the IRS.","As part of this process, we evaluated various scenarios to realizing the tax benefits from the worthless stock deduction and determined that using part of the benefit to offset current year domestic income, combined with the repatriation of a portion of the cash held by foreign subsidiaries, as the most financially beneficial alternative. Accordingly, during the second or third quarter of 2014, we intend to repatriate approximately $700 million to $800 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner by using the tax benefit resulting from the worthless stock deduction to offset the taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the repatriation. The repatriation amount utilizes substantially all of the projected, available, distributable capital reserves of our foreign subsidiaries under applicable foreign statutes.","During the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an income tax expense of approximately $167 million related to the taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the intended repatriation in 2014. For funds remaining in the foreign subsidiaries after the intended repatriation that have not been previously taxed in the U.S., our intent remains to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside of the U.S., and accordingly, we have not provided deferred U.S. taxes for such funds. We expect the remaining worthless stock deduction benefit to be used during fiscal 2014 to offset anticipated domestic income taxes.","I would now like to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. During the fourth quarter, the company generated revenue of $246 million, up 7% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $130 million, compared with $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 53% as compared to 58.8% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $292 million, compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.94 in the fourth quarter this year, compared to $0.65 for the fourth quarter last year. Results for the fourth quarter of 2013 included the income tax benefit related to the worthless stock deduction, income tax expense related to the taxable income generated in the U.S. as a result of the intended repatriation and $15.8 million pre-tax nonoperating gains from the sale of certain investments, which collectively increased net income by approximately $218 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.45.","As of December 31, 2013, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2.66 billion, up from $2.06 billion a year ago. Of the total assets, $1.7 billion were in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including $250 million in cash and cash equivalents held domestically. Total liabilities were $3.08 billion as of the fourth quarter, up from $2.07 billion a year ago.","I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2014 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $246 million for the fourth quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from foreign customers. For the full year, 2013 revenue was $965 million, up 10% year-over-year. Deferred revenue at year-end 2013 totaled $856 million, a $43 million increase from year-end 2012. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $106 million compared with $100 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $88 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter came to 56.9%, compared to 62% in the same quarter of 2012.","Last quarter, we signaled an expected increase in sales and marketing expense, which was realized in our fourth quarter results. You will also note that G&A expenses were higher in the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared with the third quarter of 2013. Much of this quarter-over-quarter increase in G&A expense is related to capital taxes and other expenses as we prepared for the worthless stock deduction and the intended repatriation of offshore assets during 2014.","The fourth quarter 2012 operating margin benefited from certain credits, as detailed in last year's press release. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $98 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.65 compared to $0.59 in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $0.59 last year -- last quarter. Full year 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.40, a 22% increase over 2012. Results for 2013 included pre-tax nonoperating gains of $15.8 million recognized during the fourth quarter from the sale of certain cross-method investments, which increased non-GAAP net income by $11.4 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.07.","Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2013 was $45 million expense and included the $15.8 million in realized nonoperating gains from investment sales mentioned earlier.","With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations. In 2014, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $50 million. Much of these expected cash taxes in 2014 relate to international withholding taxes on our intended repatriation. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 150 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 153 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 13.7 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 6.4 million for the same quarter in 2012. The share count was reduced by the full effects of third quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 4.1 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.","Operating cash flow was $147 million for the fourth quarter, compared to $134 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $171 million for the fourth quarter last year. Full year 2013 operating cash flow was $579 million compared with $538 million for 2012.","Fourth quarter free cash flow was $121 million, which includes a decrease of $11 million in excise tax benefit from stock-based compensation and a use of $15 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2013 was $533 million, including a net $19 million of excise tax benefits and a use of $66 million in capital expenditures.","With respect to 2014 guidance, revenue for 2014 should be in the range of $1 billion to $1.02 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 6%. This revenue range is based on a zone growth rate of between 2% and 4% for 2014 and takes into consideration our Q1 net additions estimate. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 58% and 60%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $73 million and $77 million for 2014. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $60 million and $80 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound performance throughout the year. We grew non-GAAP operating income and net income. We maintained a strong balance sheet, executed on improving our capital structure and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I will turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. Over the last year, we've furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value. We protected our business by providing over 16 years of uninterrupted availability of the .com and the net DNS. This track record is due to the strength and experience of our people, our commitment to excellence, our specialized and purpose-built network and the extensive redundancy built into our infrastructure. Our focus on innovation supports our business growth initiatives as we continually work to develop new products and services.","Furthermore, we've been managing the business effectively through expansion of our operating margins and delivering value to shareholders. During 2013, we repurchased 21 million shares for $1 billion. We recorded an income tax benefit of $375 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. And in 2014, we intend to repatriate $700 million to $800 million of our offshore cash. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and providing value to our customers, employees and shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to drill into the names, first of all. You mentioned a couple of factors that might be headwinds here, emerging markets, and then the renewal rate in terms of the economy. Curious on the emerging markets specifically, can you give us a sense of what kind of growth that they were contributing to the zone increase in 2013? And are there programs you expect to start to come in, in the middle of the year on that discounting trends [ph] that might be exploited? And then one follow-up.","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Sterling. So we did have some good success in penetrating some international markets last year. They seem to be performing at least early on. We have 1 month of data here with the actual date of January, and we see those markets, but primarily, I would say, China and that market being a little slower than last year. But as we talked about in our prepared comments, there are really a confluence of factors that are affecting our zone in the first quarter. And we talked about some of the changes that registrars had been making in some of their marketing tactics, really focusing more on ARPU and customer acquisitions. We also see them not discounting names as much, which is another indicator of them going after increasing ARPU instead of customer acquisitions. And we've seen the emerging market weakness. I will also say anecdotally, we've seen some continued tweaks of the Google algorithm. We do know there were 2 announced changes, one was a Penguin update and then the other one was something with regard to around how authors are viewed in their systems. But we do note that there's been some volatility in the keyword ranking, at least starting in mid-December and continuing on through January. So we've been noticing that. Haven't seen a direct correlation just yet, but that has been happening. So a confluence of factors that we've seen in the month of January. And as a result of the month of January, we've taken that input into our models and believe that will have somewhat of a negative impact for us, at least in the first half of the year. But our current models show us that the numbers of the net new adds should return in the third and fourth quarter to similar Q3 and Q4 levels from previous years.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, any thought to whether the gTLD program, whether people coming in for new sites might actually be thinking about an alternative gTLD to .com? And maybe that's having some sort of impact? And you also mentioned that your gTLD, both your names and your back-end registry, is not in guidance. Any sense of what that might contribute to 2014?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, Sterling, this is Jim. So let me take those in reverse order there. So first of all, the guidance that we gave, as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, does not include any revenue just because of visibility issues. We've been invited to begin contracting. Contracting, as you know, can be a complex process, so we just don't have the visibility to say that. Now some of our back-end customers, I think, are a little bit further down the process, and when I finish here, I'll invite Pat to comment a little bit on where some of them may be. I believe there's at least one of them that we expect to go live some time fairly early in 2014. So as far as the new gTLD program, I don't think that -- I think I don't see anybody who's going to abandon the .com for a new gTLD. There's a lot of strong anecdotal evidence that, that may not be the case. I can give you an example. So for example, you may have seen that the U.K. paper, dailymail.co.uk, a very typical English configuration for a web address, using a company dot U.K. configuration. So dailymail.co.uk purchased dailymail.com. They said that they purchased it because they wanted something that was more global that would allow them to get more traffic, especially in the U.S. They paid GBP 1 million for it. They bought it from The Charleston Daily Mail of Charleston, West Virginia, a 100-year-old Pulitzer Prize winning newspaper, who after they got their roughly $1.6 million for that domain name, were free to go out and buy whatever they wanted. Then they chose to go out and buy charlestondailymail.com. If they bought it for retail, they probably paid about $10 for it. So I think .com is very much the preferred, established reliable name. I don't know what's going to happen in the future with the TLDs. I'm sure some of them will do well, they'll build some community. But I guess I can give you one data point. If we look at -- look back, this is not the first time this has happened. There have been some new TLDs before, and one of them that I think actually is a good idea of what success what might look like, a good example would be .co. And I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with it. .co is a short name, it's just 2 letters. It's a meaningful name, it's linked to company. They went live in July of 2010. They had a very robust marketing partner, they partnered with Go Daddy, the largest registrar. They did 3 Super Bowl ads. They did, I thought, a very good job of marketing. They did partner with Go Daddy on 3 Super Bowl commercials. They have a substantial marketing budget. They had no gTLD competition when they came out. And they're not ICANN-regulated because they're operating under contract from the ccTLD .co for Colombia. So their history was that when they went live in July of 2010, they registered 100,000 domains in the first 10 minutes that they were live. Less than a year later, in June of 2011, they had reached 1 million domains. During that same period, by the way, that 11-month period, .com registered about 7 million. Just under 2 years later, by April of 2013, they had gone from 1 million to 1.5 million, so they added 500,000 domains during those 2 years. During that period, .com added 13.2 million. And then from April of 2013 until December 31 of last year, they added another 90,000 names, they closed the year at 1.59 million. .com added another 3.5 million during that time. I think they've done a great job with .co. I think they've been successful there. They ended the year at 1.59 million domains. Their growth has slowed a bit, obviously. But in Q3, we added 1.55 million names, that's the entire size of the .co zone. We added that in one quarter. We typically have 5x the size of their zone in gross adds in a quarter. So I think with somewhere in the neighborhood of, I don't know, 400 or 500 gTLDs that are non-brand that'll be distributed, it's going to be a little bit more crowded. They're obviously more specialized and different. I'm not sure where that's going to end up, but I do know that we have at least one data point, so I think we've coexisted well and done well with .co, and I'm sure we will with the other gTLDs. And I'm sure there'll be a lot of excitement as they roll out over the course of 2014. But we -- what we described as impacting our zone in the first quarter is what we see, some registrar behavior and also some economic headwinds that we're seeing in Asia.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Chaitanya for Steve Ashley. I wanted to ask, now that you're going to be repatriating $700 million to $800 million in the middle of the year, how should we be thinking about the cash use? Are you going to continue the strategy of aggressive buybacks? Or is there a possibility of more M&A or even a regular dividend?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, this is Jim. First of all, we don't guide to buyback, but I -- we prefer that you look back at our history. We are committed through our strategy framework to protect, grow and manage the business. Under, as I mentioned during my comments, under manage the business, an important component of that is that we return value to our shareholders. We have in the past used dividends, but, of course, we've made extensive use of share repurchases during '13, during 2013, as I mentioned, having deployed $1 billion in cash for share repurchase. Every quarter, we reevaluate the needs of the business and what we may do to have when we decide on capital allocation. With respect to your question about M&A, I think we've been fairly consistent over the years that sort of growth for growth's sake and growth as a strategy is not part of our growth plan. However, if we see a way to accelerate a path to either a new product that we're developing or some other opportunistic things that may come along, we're certainly not opposed to doing those kinds of things if they're consistent with our core business, consistent with our commitment to delivering good, profitable growth. So I'm not saying we're ruling out M&A completely, of course, but there's no M&A in our radar at this point. There could be opportunities in the future. There will be many new registry operators. I don't know if all 500 will ultimately succeed over the years, but again, if there's an opportunity to improve our core business and drive profitable growth through some M&A opportunity, we're certainly open to looking at it, but that is not a part of our growth strategy. We don't believe in acquisition as a growth strategy. And I'd like George to comment further.","George E. Kilguss","No, I think that's right, Jim. With all our cash, as Jim mentioned, we really look to protect, grow and manage. First off, we absolutely want to maintain [ph] enough liquidity to protect the business, the very dynamic business that we're in. There's always a cyber threat that we're thinking ahead of, and we make sure that we invest enough in the business and in the future architecture of the business to protect the business. We then look at opportunities where we can invest the business and try to achieve positive returns for investors. And once we come to that conclusion, if there's excess capital that, as Jim said, could potentially be an accretive acquisition, we may look at that. But otherwise, we historically have returned excess capital to shareholders.","D. James Bidzos","And just to add one more comment to that, I think it's often overlooked in our business, and I'll just remind everyone again that our primary strength is the reliability and stability of our global network and our platform. 16 years of uninterrupted reliability for .com has been the foundation on which the hundreds of billions of e-commerce in the U.S. alone have been built on. I think that reliability is absolutely a critical component that helped e-commerce to flourish. So that is job 1 for us. We have a contract, we have obligations to deliver under that contract. First and foremost, the first consideration for our use of cash is making sure that we maintain a secure and stable network. That's the protect part of the business and protect is first for a reason. So we do look at that. And opportunities from there, of course, we consider. But that's first and foremost. And as George mentioned, cyber attacks are becoming more frequent. More challenging, more difficult, cybersecurity is a growing area, of course. And we are a large consumer of our own cybersecurity technology, that's what's kept us delivering and performing for so long.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Absolutely. That's very helpful. And also I just wanted to kind of ask again on the domain name growth side. .net has been lagging the .com growth for a while, and it looks like that decelerated as well in the recent months. Is there any reason for that? And is there anything that you can do from a marketing perspective to help that growth?","D. James Bidzos","This is Jim. I'll just make a brief comment, and I'll invite Pat to comment on that. In past quarters, you may have heard us talk about our efforts to do more targeted marketing. I think we've had some success with that, especially in some offshore markets. And that has, I think, helped some of that growth. But if your question is specifically about the relative comparative growth between .com and .net, I'll invite Pat to comment on that.","Patrick S. Kane","So all I can think of is .com has outdone .net from the other direction. But we are taking a look at .net and continue to market that as one of our lead properties. We think it's got a lot of value that can still be gained out of it, but it will continue to grow.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, .net is over 15 million registrations, so it is rather sizable. .co, which I talked about, which I think, again, is an indication of what a successful gTLD launch is. Basically between July of 2010, when they launched, and the end of 2013, December 31, that 1.5 million names is not an easy thing to do. But .net is still roughly 10x that size.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect. And finally, I just wanted to ask on G&A. I know that the second half of last year was elevated because of the liquidation of data [indiscernible]. How do we think about G&A cost going forward when we model out for 2014?","George E. Kilguss","Sure. So, I mean, if you took our guidance that we provided to you and you use the revenue range that we gave of $1 billion to $1.20 billion and the 58% to 60% non-GAAP operating margin, that would box you into a $400 million to $428 million non-GAAP operating expense range for the full year. As it relates to the fourth quarter, we did have some expenses in the fourth quarter related to our worthless stock deduction that should not be recurring going forward. But for the full year range, I think if you just do the math on our guidance, you'll come to about a $400 million to a $428 million non-GAAP operating expense range.","Operator","And our next question will come from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","George, just wanted to ask, do the tax benefits from the worthless stock deduction completely offset the taxable income from the expected repatriation?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, we should be able to do that in a very tax efficient -- it will offset domestic taxes. We will still pay some international taxes when we do the repatriation, but as far as domestic taxes, we believe we'll able to shield about $167 million of taxes associated with that repatriation to the United States.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So just to confirm, does that mean then, I guess, that the full $700 million to $800 million can be repatriated without any offsetting cash tax liability for the company?","George E. Kilguss","Domestic cash, yes. We'll still pay some international tax, and we talked about that number. But we should be able to use that deduction to offset domestic taxes associated with repatriation.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And in Q4, did you spend the full amount of accelerated sales and marketing investments that you had initially planned? And is that something you expect will continue in the first half of this year as well?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, I would say pretty much. I mean, you saw -- if you look at the numbers, you saw that sales and marketing was up about $2 million quarter-over-quarter. We talked about that $2 million, $2.5 million as the amount that we were moving to the back half of the year, so that was pretty much in line with our expectations. I can say that we absolutely plan to continue to invest in marketing, sales and marketing activities. I mean, if you looked at sales and marketing going back a couple of years, we've been as high, for example, in 2012, as $26 million to $24 million the first 2 quarters of 2012. In this particular quarter, we were about $23 million. Again, this is on a non-GAAP basis, which just basically excludes stock-based compensation. And so we continue to look for opportunities to invest in marketing, but we are absolutely monitoring those and making sure that those uses of investments are generating positive returns.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last one. I have a question on the -- I guess for Jim or for George, on the 2014 unit growth guidance of 2% to 4% for .com and .net. In order to reach the low end of that range, just doing the math, it looks like we would have to see net adds in 2014 fall by more than 50% from 2013 levels. And given your comments that net adds should return to similar levels in Q3 and Q4 as what we've seen in previous years, it just seems very difficult to see how we would actually arrive or how you would get to the 2%. Is this just -- is that conservatism or is there something else there that I'm missing?","George E. Kilguss","Well, again, I would say we have one month of data, right? If you looked at our January results and you went to the website, you would see that for the month of January, we added about 355 million names. So January was -- I'm sorry, 355,000 names. And so it was down substantially. So we've put those actuals into our models, we've run them out, and we do think that the first half of the year will be below the first half of actual results for last year. When we look at those models today, when we run them, they indicate that those levels should return back close or near to what we did in previous quarters in the second half of the year. So closer to our 3Q and closer to 4Q of last year. Those models are dynamic. They will continue to change, but that's what we're looking at. The 2% to 4% is our view based on what we're seeing coming out of January and in our models, for the rest of the year. Obviously, as you know, you'll be able to monitor our progress from the post on our website that we update daily. And in our next quarter, we'll give you some more update based on more actual information that comes in as these different factors play out. But the 2% to 4% is our expectation for the year as we sit here today.","D. James Bidzos","I don't think you should read anything more into that other than it's simply based on the limited visibility based on the amount of time into the year that we are. We have a month's worth of data.","Operator","And our next question will come from Walter Pritchard of Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wondering if you could talk a bit about on the delta [ph] marketing expenses. It does feel like with unit growth coming down and with obviously the benefit of the price increase that you had before, that you've had on the margin side to not spend as much to get margin expansion up. I'm just wondering if that's had any -- with reduced sales and marketing spend still sort of flattish, if that's had any impact on your ability to grow the top line?","George E. Kilguss","Walter, if you look at total sales and marketing expense for the fiscal year, our spend was down a little bit year-over-year. You're correct there. Now part of that came because we're trying to revamp programs to make them more efficient. And we are investing, I think, more this year, at least in more international markets and more focus over there. And markets have cycles they go through. We had -- I think we had some good progress in some international and emerging markets. Right now there's a little bit of an economic headwind in the short term, but we still think that there's good growth opportunities in those markets. As one would expect, the marketing techniques we need to invest in, in those markets differ a little bit than in the U.S. But we'll continue to experiment in those opportunities in those markets. We find out what works and what doesn't work. But we firmly believe that marketing is impactful and can be impactful for increasing domain names. And we're working with the registrar community to help improve the programs that we're offering and getting feedback all the time. So I do think you'll see us continuing to invest in sales and marketing, and looking for more innovative ways to do that to drive new domain names.","D. James Bidzos","Yes. And Walter, this is Jim. I will just -- just as a reminder, I'm sure you're all aware of this, but for everybody who may not be, we, of course, exclusively sell through registrars. We don't sell directly. So for these opportunities that we speak, particularly outside the United States where .com is viewed as sort of a well-established global brand, we need to make some investments to prepare and educate the registrars there. And that's a slightly different challenge, of course, than working with English-speaking registrars here. There's just a bit of a slightly more complicated effort. They're farther away, they have their cultural and language differences, and so there is an investment required to get everybody up to speed so that the registrars are prepared to meet the demand that's there and to pursue the opportunities that are there. So we do need to do that marketing, it's important.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, George, just a follow-up on the tax side, [indiscernible] a good portion of it for the offsetting that we did reach [ph]. Can you talk about how you're able to use the other roughly $200 million worthless stock tax credit there? Is it that the reduction is still tax-free [ph] or is there a reduction in cash tax, or over what timeframe?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, sure. So of the roughly $375 million net benefit, as you allude to, we expect to use about $167 million for the repatriation. That will leave us about $208 million. Approximately, half of that $208 million will be used to defer or offset 2013 taxable income. It'll be able to shield that net income. The balance, about $100 million, we expect to use in a normal course in 2014. So we clearly will have U.S. income next year, but we expect to be able to use about $100 million of that benefit in 2014. And we should be through that benefit at the end of next year.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then the rest just sort of stays on as the deferred tax asset [indiscernible]?","George E. Kilguss","So that should use up most of the usable benefit. We do have some capital losses, but we don't really see any need for them or use for them in the immediate future. So we have valuation reserved against the capital losses. But the losses that we think we can use, we absolutely have put [ph] and that's been part of the game that we're working [ph].","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Craig Nankervis at First Analyst.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I don't recall if you spoke to your IP strategy in your prepared remarks, and I wondered if you did not -- I didn't think I heard it, but if you did not, if there has been any sort of update. Maybe we'll just start with that.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, I'm sorry. You said IP?","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Yes.","D. James Bidzos","I couldn't hear, I didn't know if you said IT or IP. Yes, if you're talking specifically about our patent program, I did allude to progress that we've made over the quarter, and we did make progress. We have an active program underway to evaluate and develop our plans for exploiting our rather substantial intellectual property portfolio. And I think all I can tell you at this point is that we've made progress in that effort. There's nothing beyond that, that we're ready to publicly disclose at this time. But that effort does continue and we have made progress.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Are you willing to say whether there is a specific strategy beyond the straightforward increase of patent applications? Is there a game plan beyond that activity?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I would say in general, a good approach to any strategy that's designed to exploit your intellectual property, first and foremost, of course, is the investment in developing the IP. And yes, we have done that, and yes, we will continue to do that. I think every program starts with a very careful assessment of what that portfolio is, what value it has, how it can best be exploited, how it can best serve your business interest, whatever those may be. So without getting into details of exactly where we are in that process, we're well along the evaluation process. One needs to understand what one has, match it up to their business strategy and then develop a plan to exploit it. So that's our strategy, and we're progressing down that path. So without giving any details about where we are, we're pleased with the progress we're making and moving down that strategic path. And along the way, we absolutely do continue to innovate, and the patent filings are a byproduct of that innovation where we continue to do that. We take a lot of pride in that.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Am I pushing it a little much by asking, is there any likelihood that something actually happens on this front this year? Or are you not willing to speak to much of a timetable?","D. James Bidzos","I think it's just early to say anything at this point. We'll certainly keep you up-to-date, but this quarter's update is that we're active and we're making progress.","Operator","And our next question will come from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I just want to get some color on just sort of the process in interacting with ICANN on these refilled [ph], entering into contract talks. And sort of what is being sort of negotiated here or what could be negotiated back and forth? And then as far as those that have -- and several has been sort of asked through your interim talks. And what percentage of those are you potentially serving as the -- or are you serving as -- going to be serving at the back-end infrastructure [ph] and -- or you already have some sort of contract in place?","Patrick S. Kane","This is Pat, and I'll talk to the contracting process. And so there's a base contract that was part of the application guide that ICANN put together that everybody starts from. And there were -- some gTLD applicants were invited to contract even though there were still some issues around the name collisions and how they were going to be handled. And basically we've been waiting to see kind of what that name collision process ends up looking like before we go down a road to where we don't really know what the process is to handle them or basically work within the ICANN framework. So we've been -- so we have 9 months -- there's a 9-month process to go through the contracting process and we've been invited to do that. At the end of that 9 months, there's an opportunity to extend that negotiating contract, an additional 9 months, for a total of 18-month window to negotiate. So there's still some things that we will go to the table and ask for within those contracts. And so it could take some time. And the IDNs that we have, because of the proposed process that we put in place, it could take a bit longer because for -- since sort of we are focusing on helping IP and trademarking intellectual property, protect the brands within those IDNs, which are transliterations of .com and .net. It may take a little bit of extra time for us to do -- to get through that.","Operator","I'm showing [indiscernible].","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just as far as the others that have been invited, outside of the ones that you can directly ask to talk to, how many have you already sort of established the contracts where they've been [indiscernible] to service the back-end?","Patrick S. Kane","As far as our back-end services, I don't think that it's really in our place right now to talk about exactly where they are in the contracting process because it is their contracting process. But as Jim said earlier, we will have some that will go live in the spring, but some will take longer.","D. James Bidzos","But just to avoid any confusion, the contract between those applicants and VeriSign, those contracts have been completed and been in place for quite some time.","Patrick S. Kane","Almost 2 years.","D. James Bidzos","Almost 2 years, and that's roughly 200 back-end registry services customers that are applicants. So they have to get through ICANN's process. They have signed up with us, which is the way that they met the requirements under the ICANN process to have established a registry capability by specifying VeriSign as their back-end service provider. But their contracting process or their string itself is between them and ICANN. And that will be what it is between those 2 parties.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on that line of conversation. Pat, you mentioned, to protect trademarks and the IDNs, that may take longer. I guess it was our understanding that there was that period of time that the trademark clearinghouse was supposed to do that. Are you saying that you're doing something above and beyond what the trademark clearinghouse is doing?","Patrick S. Kane","Yes. Essentially I haven't said that we're doing something different, and because what we're doing -- we may have talked about this in previous calls, but the idea of applying for the transliterations of .com and .net, one of the benefits of that was to protect the applicant -- or protect the registrant that has invested in .com today. So if there's a transliteration of .com in Chinese, what we have proposed to do is to make certain that only the registrant that is -- or if the registrant has already registered in .com, that they're the only one that has the opportunity to register that domain name in the transliterated version for Chinese or for Hangul or for whatever TLD that we've operated. So that's something that's unique to what we're doing within our applications. And so that's an additional protection for intellectual property and trademarks.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then on a different topic, Jim, the proposed guidance has one of the smaller margin expansions that we've seen in the last couple of years, but you're not including potential revenue from the 3 sources that we've discussed. If you were to get revenue from gTLDs or IP, should we think that those would come in and potentially drive incremental margin expansion above the guidance level? Or would there be expenses associated with it, so that's still a good range to think about even if there was a higher revenue add from those sources?","D. James Bidzos","Sterling, I love your question. I think I can answer this one, even though it started with if. So I have consistently said over the quarters that I've been speaking with our investors that the growth areas that we're looking at, they're complex, as Pat pointed out, with respect to IDNs. They are sort of specialized in the sense that we're looking for business opportunities that leverage the investment we've made in this network. And so that, therefore, they should yield margins that are comparable to the existing business. And that's why it's taking maybe a little bit longer. We don't do quarterly press releases about new features or products. We're looking for opportunities that play on our strength, that leverage the investment we've made in a powerful global infrastructure that's reliable and high-volume transactions, high-volume registrations and ultra high-volume resolutions in the many, many tens of billions or in excess of 100 billion per day. And so in looking for those applications, by definition, they would yield margins that are, I guess, in the end, are targeted to be accretive to the margins in our business. So I think we certainly aspire to deliver those services in such a way that if there were going to be revenue, that I -- our goal is to have it not adversely impact our margins.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And last question would be, last earnings call, you talked about going into -- I don't think you wanted to call it a beta, but attach with a potential customer on a new product or service during the fourth quarter. Any update to that? Any update to when you might actually release whatever it is commercially?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I've not been quite as timely with that goal as I've sort of hinted in past quarters. And so I wish I had a little bit more I can tell you, but all I can say at this point is that we have made progress. It's an active effort, and we have made progress, and when we can share something with you, we absolutely will. So I apologize, I can't say more than that right now.","Operator","And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Mr. Atchley for any additional or closing comments.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter capped a year of solid growth, execution, financial performance and shareholder returns for VeriSign. During the past year, we completed a 4-year board-directed restructuring plan, which included divesting non-core businesses, the sale of our Authentication Services business and relocating our headquarters. This restructuring has resulted in a more efficient and more focused VeriSign that we believe is better prepared for the opportunities ahead.  We delivered both for the global community of Internet users that increasingly rely on us and for our shareholders. ","As stewards of critical elements of Internet infrastructure, both what we do and how we do it are important for the secure and reliable operation of the global Internet, upon which billions of people worldwide depend.","In 2011, we continued to demonstrate our commitment to shareholders by completing the return of divestiture proceeds. In May, we paid a special dividend of $463 million to shareholders and $100 million in contingent interest to bondholders. We also continued our share repurchase program during the year, with 16.3 million shares repurchased, returning $535 million during 2011.","On our last earnings call, we described several pending cash activities. These included the full payment for the rest of the building purchased, potential financing scenarios and the pending repatriation of previously taxed offshore cash. We mentioned this repatriation in our last call but did not state the amount, which is $86 million. All of these items will resolve as expected by December 31. As these activities were pending during the fourth quarter, we took a conservative approach, and for this reason alone, we did not make share repurchases. ","Security and stability are paramount for the way we run our business, and this extends to the way we manage our liquidity. So, on December 31, with all the pending cash activity successfully concluded, we held $225 million in domestic cash and $1,125,000,000 in offshore cash. We have $831 million remaining under our current share repurchase authorization.  We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best use for our cash, including potential share repurchases. John will discuss our cash balance in more detail in a few minutes.","During the fourth quarter, we completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Reston, Virginia. We are excited about this new facility as it brings our main corporate functions under one roof. We're already seeing efficiencies and enhanced collaboration among our teams in the new building. ","Also, I'd like to give you a quick update from our last call regarding our search for a CFO. As mentioned last time, we have begun a search for a new CFO and are starting the interviewing process. Of course, we'll keep you updated as things progress.","As we look towards 2012, one important area of focus is the .com agreement renewal. The process and timeline are on track, and we will provide updates as appropriate leading up to the renewal. Since we last spoke to you, we are engaged and are pleased with the progress.","I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 113.8 million at the end of December. This represents an 8% increase year-over-year in the base and then approximately 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. In the fourth quarter, we added 1.9 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 7.9 million new registrations, which is about a 4% increase over the same period a year ago. The fourth quarter was our strongest Q4 for new registrations on record. In fact, that's true for each of the quarters in 2011, thus making it our strongest year for new registrations with over 32 million new registrations processed. ","The Q3 2011 renewal rate was 73.3%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2011 will be approximately 73.4%.  We expect the Q1 net names added to the base to be between 2.4 million and 2.7 million names, which reflects the continued growth and the underlying drivers of the Internet, as well as seasonality.","Looking at our NIA business. The team performed very well and exceeded our full year bookings target. The NIA sales team is now fully hired and in place, and we expect 2012 to be a year of execution for the business.  We are focused on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth. ","As we look forward to 2012, our focus will be to: number one, continue providing unparalleled network and registry services performance; number two, renew the .com agreement with ICANN and receive approval of the agreement by the Department of Commerce; number three, invest in benefiting from the new gTLD program by both applying for strategic names ourself and teaming with other applicants as their backend registry service provider. ","By the way, we've been selected by several brands that ran an early selection process in anticipation of their applications for new gTLD succeeding. While the revenue is not material and not expected before 2013, I wanted to let you know that we're already competing successfully as the backend service provider. This says a lot about the quality work our Registry Services and network ops teams have been doing. ","Number four, we want to continue to invest in and grow the NIA business; number five, continue to identify and select opportunities for growth through value-added services, which leverage our core strength and offer quality of revenue; and number six, of course, continue to act as responsible stewards for critical elements of global Internet infrastructure, both operationally and in the management of the business.","We believe this is the appropriate, responsible strategy for balancing stability, growth and shareholder interest, all of which are intertwined. ","Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Calys","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jim explained, this is another solid quarter and year for us. During 2011, we generated revenue of $772 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $384 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins by 792 basis points.  These results drove approximately $157 million in free cash flow for the year. ","Following on to Jim's comments on our cash position. The total cash of investment balance ended Q4 at $1.35 billion. Of this balance, $225 million is domestic. During the quarter, we initiated a new 5-year $200 million credit facility, borrowed $100 million against this facility as short-term financing for our Reston building purchase. In fact, the [ph] cash balance also included $86 million of previously taxed income that was repatriated at the end of the quarter.","Let me recap our performance for the fourth quarter and year on our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss 2012 full year guidance.","Revenue of $204 million for the fourth quarter was up 3% from the prior quarter and up 14% year-over-year. 2011 revenue of $772 million was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $729 million, a $6 million increase from Q3 2011 and a $66 million increase year-over-year, up 10%. ","Non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 50.9% compared to 50.1% in Q3. 4Q non-GAAP operating expenses were $100 million, up sequentially and flat year-over-year. The fourth quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and ways to improve our operating margin.","Net income and EPS.  Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $64 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 compared to $0.39 in Q3 and $0.31 in the same period in 2010. 2011 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.49 is a 43% increase over 2010. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2011 was $28 million. This included a pretax $4 million nonoperating accrued expense booked in Q4, which is non-recurring in nature and had a negative effect of $0.02 on EPS.","With respect to taxes. We think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 160 million shares in Q4 compared to 164 million in third quarter. ","Operating cash flow on a consolidated basis was $124 million in the fourth quarter and $336 million for 2011, which includes the payout of $100 million in contingent interest to holders of our convertible debt.","Free cash flow was $6.6 million in Q4, given $11.6 million in excess tax benefits and $129 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2011 was $157 million after $13 million in excess tax benefits and approximately $193 million in capital expenditures. Relating to capital expenditures, the company closed a property purchase of the Reston, Virginia, headquarters building on November 15, 2011 for $118 million. ","To reiterate, we saw solid performance in Q4. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","With respect to 2012 guidance.  Revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $865 million to $890 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%.","Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our businesses, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","I will now turn the call back to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, John. In summary, we're pleased with the performance and milestones we've marked in 2011. In addition to completing the restructuring plan, we renewed .net until 2017, DNSSEC went live in .com and we extended our .tv agreement. VeriSign was selected to run .gov for the U.S. government, and we have been selected to service the registry operator for applicants for potential future gTLDs under the new ICANN program. We brought in new talent at all levels, and we moved into our new building in Reston. ","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Wanted to ask about deferred revenue. Deferred revenue growth was lower than expected, and short-term deferred revenue basically didn't grow sequentially. Was there, Jim, any sort of registry purge or some other factor? Or was it just a function of demand possibly being a little bit lower than you were expecting in the quarter?","John Calys","This is John. Let me take that. I don't think that was really a surprise to us. A lot of the deferred revenue trends are seasonal. First quarter is always a strong seasonal quarter, so you see a little more of a bump. So sometimes, it could be choppy. Quarter-over-quarter, I think the full year 10% increase is what was expected, but there was no unusual purge or anything of that nature.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of renewal rates over the last 3 quarters, that is assuming that your expected Q4 estimate holds, there hasn't been much change in the overall renewal rate. So I just wanted to get your view on renewal rates in 2012. I would think you should start to see more of an uplift, particularly as the base gets a little bit more mature.","D. James Bidzos","This is Jim. I've invited Pat Kane, who's our executive in charge of the registry. And, Pat, do you want to take that one?","Patrick S. Kane","Yes. So the renewal -- as the age of the base, as you pointed out, gets older, you do see a change in the percentage of previously renewed domains versus first-time renewing domains. And since the previously renewed domains actually renew at a higher rate, you will see a natural growth.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could just ask one other question. So there have been some corporations who have voiced opposition to the new gTLDs, including the timeline and process. I was just curious to get your thoughts on that, and just more broadly, how you envision this moving forward. Do you expect everything to move according to plan?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, this is Jim. We monitor this closely. We're supportive of the multi-stakeholder model and ICANN's plans to move forward. There has been opposition from patent holders. There were hearings both in the House and in the Senate, but the program opened up on January 12 for applications. The application period closes on April 12. And on May 1, ICANN will publish on its website a list of all of the applications. I expect that there will probably be some more comments from the various stakeholders, but that's how the process works. So from our perspective, as I said, we're participants in the program. We're supportive of ours and the participation of others in it. And I think we've made our view of that clear, that we apply for domain names. We see it as an opportunity to be a service provider. We don't expect the revenue to be material. We don't expect it before 2013, but we expect the market to grow. And we expect our business to grow as a result.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to focus on margins for a moment. Obviously, the exit margin guidance you gave of, whatever, 52% to 54%, I believe consensus was 51.6%, it was clearly ahead of where consensus was. What's driving that continued leverage? And then, Jim, how should we think about just margins going forward and the leverage of this business? And just kind of -- is there a target that you have in mind or a ceiling that you see out there? Or how do you think about it?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I think the guidance that we -- margin guidance that we just delivered for 2012 is obviously the way we see it and describe it now. I'll just say that post restructuring, I think there's kind of a long tail that I would describe as a continual optimization of our efforts to do a better job, to focus on our customers better and change the way we do things. Remember, we've gone from over 5,000 employees to roughly 1,000. Actually, we ended 2011 at 1,009 employees. So the process of discovering processes here at VeriSign that haven't caught up with the new VeriSign yet, I think, will probably continue for a while. So I think you see that reflected in our guidance for the year. So I expect in the process of finding ways to do our job better, we'll probably find efficiencies, and we expect that to happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Any thoughts, high-level, of how fast you expect the zone file to grow in 2012?","D. James Bidzos","Yes. The revenue guidance that we gave you was $865 million to $890 million for the year, and that has underlying a 6% to 8% unit growth rate for net new names.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect. And this might be for Pat Kane. But on the new gTLDs, the question that I get asked is, will this cannibalize .com, and if not, kind of why not?","Patrick S. Kane","Well, what the new gTLD program is designed to do is to offer more choice for individual registrants. And while that will certainly have people choose domain names in different TLDs for the first time, we also recognize there's tremendous value in having your domain name in .com. And so we will likely see multiple registrations for individual registrants.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then lastly, can you say how many new gTLDs VeriSign intends to bid for directly?","D. James Bidzos","I think -- go ahead, Pat.","Patrick S. Kane","Well, we intend to do about 12. Most of those will be transliterations of .com.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Maguire with CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could address your expectations around the NIA business. There's been a lot of headlines about the impact of hacker groups and denial of service attacks. And what your expectations for that business will be over the next year.","D. James Bidzos","Well, as we mentioned, that business exceeded our expectations in 2011. We like that business. We think it's a business of growing importance. In particular, I think what you're referring to, which is the DDoS Mitigation part of that business, although we saw growth across all 3 sections of the NIA business, there is the iDefense threat intelligence unit, a managed DNS business, and of course the DDoS Mitigation service. Certainly, denial of service attacks have been more visible, and there's tremendous interest in technology that's available, a service that's available for companies to protect themself. We're well-positioned to benefit from that. I think it's one of the reasons we like the business. It's a growth area. The other reason, of course, is that it leverages our core strengths and our reputation, and we have a tremendous amount of experience. In general, concerning NIA, we now have the sales force hired. We're where we want to be there. And the areas that we're working on in NIA primarily is to structure it for scalability and also to find ways to improve the quality of revenue and make it closer to the quality of revenue that most of our revenues reflect. So we're optimistic about it, but we're obviously not breaking it out separately. And can't tell you exactly when we'll do that. But we're continuing to invest in that business.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And just a follow-up on your uses of cash for buybacks. What pace of buybacks are you expecting to implement this year? And do you also have any plans to deploy some of that offshore cash?","John Calys","I missed just the last word there.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","To deploy the cash that's offshore.","John Calys","Yes, right. We don't provide any specific guidance on our repurchase activity normally. Obviously, we have $831 million left under our board-approved plan. We evaluate our cash needs and potential uses for cash on a regular basis, and that includes evaluating our offshore cash balances as well in terms of doing what we think is optimal for the company and the shareholders.","D. James Bidzos","Ed, this is Jim. I would just add that, basically, our view of buybacks as one option for returning value to shareholders is unchanged. The board authorization of $831 million, as John mentioned, continues to stand. Nothing's changed in our view, and I think we made it clear that there were just pending cash liquidity issues that were unresolved. They did all become favorably resolved at the end of Q4, but as we mentioned, that was the only reason that there were no buybacks in the quarter.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, I'm wondering what type of updates -- you said we'll get updates on the .com process. I mean, what sort of updates do you envision providing us as we go through the next February month with that process ongoing?","D. James Bidzos","Let's see. I guess the material events that would certainly be disclosed, of course, would be the -- if you follow the .net process, as I'm sure most of you probably did, there was some point at which we came together with ICANN, agreed on the form of renewal. There were some minor issues, as we mentioned, in the contract. So if you could look back at .net when those issues were addressed and a version of the contract was ready for the public review process, it was then posted on ICANN's website for public comment for 30 days. I will say there's been one change since last year. There's a new ICANN policy that became effective January 1, 2012, in which their public comment periods have changed from a single 30-day comment period to 2 comment periods of 21 days each, effectively making the 30-day comment period a 42-day comment period. But I think the next visible event will be the presentation of that agreement for comment, that then follows, of course, formal approval by ICANN's Board of Directors. And .com, of course, being a little different than .net, we then present that to the Department of Commerce for their approval. So those are the high-level sequence of events. All of that should conclude no later than the termination date of the existing agreement, the expiration date, which is November 30, 2012. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is a timetable and a process. There's been engagement and activity since I last spoke to you, and we're pleased with that progress. So I think that's what we can say to you right now, but that's an overview of the process itself. And I think those are the events you can expect to see being disclosed certainly by VeriSign, but also information that'll appear on, in particular, the contract for public comment on ICANN's website.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just on -- I guess it may be a question for Pat. But on the domain name guidance, if I look at, I guess, this quarter, we had some confusion on our end whether or not it was 1.8 or 1.9 adds but sort of in the lower end of your range. I recall last quarter, kind of in the lower end of your range. And I'm wondering, as you look at the guidance that you give, what in the last couple of quarters and then how are you looking at Q1 in terms of that range and what factors are driving you to be in the -- have driven you to be in the low end and may influence Q1?","Patrick S. Kane","Well, growth is always dependent upon 2 factors. One is the new registrations and one is the renewal rates as well. And so when we take a look at the range, we have to take into account what renewal rates will look like. And renewal rates fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, dependent upon specific activity from specific registrars. So we know we'll end up within the range. But it's I think sort of the function of the renewal rate as to how we end up where we end up within that range.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess what you're saying is the last couple of quarters it's been more renewal rates that have been the delta within that range rather than the gross new adds?","Patrick S. Kane","Well, I mean, it's -- I guess the answer would be yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to follow up, Jim, on the renewal timeline. Given that it's an election year and given the timing of when the contract expires, is there a chance that it can go beyond November 30? And can you just review for people if it were to -- how the contracts are actually handled at that point?","D. James Bidzos","Well, we certainly don't anticipate that we wouldn't be finished. Our timeline, certainly, the timeline and the engagement process are all designed to avoid any issues that would cause the process to extend beyond November 30. So I just don't envision that happening. I suppose it's possible, but I don't see that happening. There is a requirement that the ICANN VeriSign agreed contract be presented to the Department of Commerce for their approval 90 days prior to the expiration, and we're certainly planning to meet or beat that date and make sure that there's plenty of time to get the contract renewed, which I think everybody feels is in everyone's best interest. So I guess I don't envision that happening.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. A different topic. When you look at the fourth quarter, did you guys run any special programs with registrars to help motivate name additions? What are your plans for kind of work with registrars as you look into the first half of 2012?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, we ran some additional marketing and promotional programs in 4Q, not particularly large, but a little bit. And I would expect for 2012 that those numbers would be pretty consistent with what they've been historically for us.  Generally, the programs we run are not material, and generally, they're sort of -- at the first half of the year, I think we generally run more than we do in the second half.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And based on your kind of talks and interactions with registrars, how do you feel about -- since they're your channel, how do you feel about the help of that channel and kind of where they're positioned to help drive growth in that Naming business for 2012?","D. James Bidzos","Pat talks to them all the time, visits with them frequently, so perhaps he can...","Patrick S. Kane","Well, I think if you just take a look at the new unit numbers that Jim talked about earlier where each quarter of this year was the strongest quarter we've ever had in that quarter, it's a healthy channel. They are finding uses for domain names. Whether it be small, medium businesses, enterprises, et cetera, they're -- it's strong.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, their drivers, they haven't changed. It's Internet adoption. There's more growth internationally than there is in the U.S. It's the continual move of dollars from traditional to online advertising. Basically, all the things that we're seeing just simply continuing. Internet adoption is a growth area.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Scott Kessler with S&P Capital.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research","I was wondering if you could possibly highlight one or 2 examples. Jim, you highlighted value-added services as a potential growth area for this year, and maybe if you could just talk about one or 2 areas where you might see some uplift.","D. James Bidzos","Sure. I guess the obvious area is, first of all, there are several categories of value-added services. First of all, Pat's group is continually developing value-added services for the registrar channel to help them manage their business. We provide them with information, we provide them with data, reports, analyses from the zone that help them manage their business better and hopefully maximize the registrations that they perform. We call that value-added services here at VeriSign. The other growth area that we talked about was NIA, which is an adjacency that's very relevant in the sense that it plays to our strength. The IDN or our DDoS Mitigation service, of course, is a result of homegrown efforts from a very purpose-developed network where we couldn't buy off the shelf solutions, and now we've productized some of those. And managed DNS is essentially our ability to deliver our experience in developing performance in the network and deliver that to customers. So all of those things you might consider value-added services. Certainly, even though we're the largest consumer of some of the threat intelligence information that comes from our iDefense unit, that is also a value-added services. There are new value-added services that we're exploring. We're not talking about these. These are areas, research that we've engaged in. I think it's fair to say we're focused on this like we haven't been before. We're investing more in research. We think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. We are seeing opportunities. And these are fundamental new value-added services that would complement and fit well with our current DNS lookup services. So until we're ready to talk about those, we can't say more. But that is the focus of our research efforts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jaimin Soni with Bank of America.","Jaimin Soni","I just wanted to follow up on the last question. And looking at the margins guidance that you guys have provided, margins were obviously expected to grow at a nice clip next year. Do you think there's more opportunity in investing more of this upside back into the business to fuel the other growth options that you guys are looking at, like NIA? And are you comfortable with the level of investment in these adjacent opportunities?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, that's a very good question. And the answer is absolutely yes. So in the case of NIA in particular, I mentioned that we're doing a couple of things with NIA. Number one is that we're focusing on structuring it to scale for growth. So -- and also, what we're doing with NIA is finding ways that we can sort of increase the quality of revenue to look more like our traditional business. So those are 2 things we want to do before we make the investment. Before we essentially step on the gas pedal, so to speak, we want to make sure that it's going to scale well, grow smoothly and provide a quality of revenue. So anything that we can do up front before we make the major investment, I think, will pay great dividends down the road if we're successful in achieving good, scalable growth and quality of revenue. So we will be making those investments. We have been making that effort to optimize the business, and that's been the focus of NIA. And we have plenty of cash, and I think you'll -- essentially, our guidance for you in 2012 incorporates our anticipated investments in those areas. There is no anticipation that we would make any acquisitions to fuel that growth. I think most of what we want to do leverages our core strengths. VeriSign, I think most of you understand, is unique. We do have a very purpose-developed network that's actually unique. I think that's something that's not well understood that in the future we're going to try to communicate better. Not only are we databases linked together by a high-speed network, but our ability to do updates, to do them quickly in realtime essentially and replicate it globally across a very diverse network and reliably is unique. And when you're talking about developing services that come from that sort of strength, trading on that kind of strength, those are investments that we have to make here. We have to make that, not buy it, because nobody's doing anything like that. Now if there are opportunities that we see to accelerate that process by making acquisitions that allow us to buy versus make pieces of those efforts as they start to come together, we'll certainly look at those and do those. But it's our view that we have adequate cash to do all of those growth areas and make all those investments. And that's all baked into our guidance for 2012 in margins.","Jaimin Soni","So, Jim, when you say that you want to build a base on NIA a little bit more before you step on the accelerator, is this more of a second half of 2012 that we're thinking about or 2013, when you think the timing would be right?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I think what we've said is that at this point, we fully staffed up the NIA sales team. We've done some optimization and restructuring a bit in how the products are packaged and bundled and sold. There are ways in which we have a billing relationship with the customer that will help us get sort of the right scalable structure. I think we're getting pretty close to the end of that process. And 2012, as we said, is a year of execution. So throughout the year, we'll be making investments as we see appropriate, depending on how the marketing effort plays out. But I think we're pretty close to getting ready to make some investments and grow that business a little bit quicker. It's a solid growth area, leverages our strength, there is a need and we like it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on new name growth. So you mentioned the 4 record quarters that you had throughout 2011. And as I extrapolate kind of your range for Q1, it seems like you're expecting again another record in Q1 of '12 and even maybe a little bit of acceleration in the year-over-year growth. So as we think about '12, how should we begin to think about new name growth, especially kind of given the global economic situation?","D. James Bidzos","Pat, do you want to comment?","Patrick S. Kane","Yes, this is Pat. So Jim mentioned some of the factors that we track in terms of Internet adoption, online advertising spend. And as those metrics continue to go up and to the right, we will -- people will find new ways to use domains, generate new small, medium businesses and continue to find ways on the Internet. So I think that as long as people continue to adopt the Internet, both domestically and internationally, we're going to see continued growth within .com.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, I think Internet adoption, really, is the key here. I mean, I know some numbers, but I don't know some others. For example, the GDP in the U.S. is roughly $15 trillion. In Europe, it's roughly $16 trillion. And globally, it's about $63 trillion. What portion of U.S. GDP is economic activity that's reliant on the Internet? It's probably more -- substantially more than the rest of the world certainly and probably more than Europe. But the rest of the world is catching up. I think that's one way to just think about the opportunity. Pat's right, Internet adoption and growth, greater reliance of economic activity on the use of the Internet, that's going to continue at a rate that's probably faster than in the U.S. only because of the amount of penetration in the market here. And I think the challenge is ours to find ways to make sure we get our fair share and exploit it and be smart about how we go after it. And we look at those things, we think about them. And we see growth, and we see opportunities.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then any sense of how many names are up for renewal in Q1 of '12?","D. James Bidzos","I'm sorry, the number of names that are up for renewal in calendar 2012?","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","No, Q1 of '12.","D. James Bidzos","Oh, I'm sorry, Q1. I don't know if I have that number handy.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And the only other question, with regard to the registry, I think it's a -- somewhat of a follow-on to Walter's question when he talked about -- I think it's been 4 out of the last 6 quarters, you've been at the lower end of the range, and you talked about that really being a function of the renewal rate. And I know there's 2 varying renewal rates that you guys track. It's names that are 1 year old and names that are multiple years old. So if that's been coming in a little bit lower, is it one group or the other?","John Calys","The renewal rates on both are trending up slightly, both for first time and times renewing past their first time. I think the renewal rate split is about 56.2 on first time, and it's 82.2 roughly, I think, for second time and beyond. And certainly, as those names renew, beyond the first time, second, third and fourth, that rate continues to climb.","D. James Bidzos","By the way, we found the other number. So the number that's coming up for renewal in Q1 of 2012 is 25.2 million.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Jim, I wonder if you could tell us, if you'd be willing to tell us, how much NIA contribution or a growth range you're assuming for the revenue guidance for 2012.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, we're not breaking that out, so it's probably early to tell you that. I hope that during 2012, we'll be able to tell you a lot more about it. I think all we said at this point and all I can say now is that the team is exceeding its bookings target that we assigned it.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","And just one follow-up related to NIA. Is the distribution model changing yet very much quarter-on-quarter? Do you envision it changing much in 2012 for VeriSign?","D. James Bidzos","There's a transition that's going on that we're very pleased with. It's going well. That's part of the scaling efforts, is a shift in the distribution model, and that's going according to plan.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had 2 housekeeping follow-ups. Can you go into a little bit more detail? I missed the 2-set impact on the non-recurring. I think you said it was a $4 million pretax charge. Can you just give us a little detail what that was regarding? And I had one other follow-up.","John Calys","That was a non-recurring item that we booked in fourth quarter, onetime for $4 million. And we don't expect it to recur, and it passed us.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But what was it tied to? What was it referring to?","John Calys","It referred to some non-income-related taxes, non-income tax.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, out of period.","John Calys","Right.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And then the other one is, with the cash that you're able to repatriate, is there additional cash that you can use the same methods to repatriate additional cash going forward?","John Calys","At this point in time, what we repatriated was all of our previously taxed income, at least through the end of 2011 -- or 2010, I'm sorry, 2010. So there's a small amount of incremental income that's earned offshore that gets taxed U.S. every year. Obviously, the objective is not to have any, but there's a little bit each year. That amount that we repatriated had built it up over a few-year period. So I wouldn't [ph] say there's a substantial amount of previously taxed income to bring back near term.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session.

Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.","We reported revenue of $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year, and delivered solid financial performance including non-GAAP EPS of $1.18, up 12% year-over-year. During the second quarter we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares for $125 million.","Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.

But beyond that we don't have anything else to say at this time.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. The increase was primarily a result of improved new domain name registrations and improving renewal rates over the prior year.","Operating income for the period totaled $193 million compared with $175 million in the second quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter a year ago.","Net income totaled $128 million compared to $123 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.04 in the second quarter of this year compared to $0.99 for the same quarter of last year.","As of June 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $569 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.","I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full-year guidance.","As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million compared to $101 million last quarter and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 68.2%, compared to 66.3% last quarter and 65.3% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $145 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.2 million shares.

Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, George. Second quarter was a solid one for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues were generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders.","We continue to work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. Last week the company surpassed 21 continuous years of 100% availability in the common net DNS.","This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure.","We will now take your questions.

Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. And I know, Jim, that you said you won't comment on the CA. But I thought I'd give it a shot anyway.","On the time line it's a November expiration so is it likely we would get some resolution on this before kind of our next earnings call? Or is it something that we would be unlikely to hear about until the actual expiration? And then I just had a quick follow-up. Thank you.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah, Rob. Nice try. Sorry, we're engaged in a dialogue with NTIA and really can't speculate on the time line. It's their process.","Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, Jim. And then I just wanted to ask about just kind of where we are with .web and any color that you guys can provide around how that ramp might begin to look. Thank you guys very much.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure, thanks. Well, we're engaged in ICANN's process on .web to move the delegation forward but this is ICANN's process so we can't say exactly when it will conclude. We'll certainly give you updates when they're available. Operator, another one?","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Hey. Hi guys, this is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. So just to hit on the Cooperative Agreement, Jim, you mentioned about that you are amending the agreement with ICANN?","Just so that we are clear on that one, is it ruled out about the possibility of renewing or the contract throwing away and the third possibility of amending is the one that you are taking moving forward?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, that is the statement that we made. Those others were certainly in a range of possibility. I suppose anything is possible. But the facts as they sit today that I can say speaking for both VeriSign and NTIA is precisely the statement that I made earlier, which is that we are engaged in a dialogue about amending the Cooperative Agreement and what that amendment would look like.","And I guess I would just add that amendments are certainly possible by mutual agreement between NTIA and VeriSign. So again we're engaged and that's the process we're in currently.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Great.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Since that process is still ongoing I can't speculate on what's possible at the end of it. But that's the statement I'm providing today.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Great. I mean, that's helpful. And one on the like net additions for the total domain names, you are guiding to something like 4% at the midpoint. I mean, that's the best rates that we have seen so far. Like if you exclude out the China in 2015. What is driving that particular increase in the domain? Is that the cross additions that you are seeing or the high renewal rates from the existing customers that is driving that net additions up?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. This is George. As you saw in the second quarter, we had good performance in net adds from the domain name base. And in the second quarter that primarily came from improved gross adds. Gross adds were $9.6 million versus $9.2 million a year ago in the second quarter and slightly improved renewal rates which were, as Jim mentioned, the preliminary renewal rate for second quarter is 74.9%, up from 74% a year ago. And we expect those trends to continue here into the third quarter. And that really \u2013 those two factors really are the basis of our guidance.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","All right. And if I could squeeze one more in on the operating margins, I mean 68.2% has been really the peak of the margins. But you are guiding to 66%, 67% for 2018. Any particular expenses that you expect in the back half of the year that should drag the margins down from the June quarter level?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, if you look at the second quarter, you can see that our expenses, our non-GAAP expenses were down about $4 million year-over-year. And as I have mentioned before, quarter-to-quarter we do have some timing differences with some spend that we put into the business. And Q4 was lower by that $4 million. Roughly $3 million of it was in marketing and $1 million was in G&A. But we still expect to be around that $100 million expense going forward.","And when we think about where they are \u2013 we'll probably see a little bit more in marketing expense go out in subsequent quarters. But we've given \u2013 we really don't guide to quarterly expense or margin. The full year guidance is what we expect we'll fall between for the remainder of the year.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","That's perfect. Really helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our last question from Matthew Wells with Citi.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. This is Matt Wells with Citi. Thanks for taking my questions. And just digging into growth in the zone file and net adds, can you just talk to where you are seeing strength geographically?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Yes. I'd say similar to last quarter, Matt, we continue to see U.S. registrars do well, as well as registrars in China. But the U.S. registrars have performed well for us this year year-to-date.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Are you able to just speak directionally around the breakout between U.S. and China, net add?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, for the first half of the year -- I mean, again we know that our (00:15:10) registrars are performing well. I'd say it's fairly balanced between the two areas. I'd say the U.S. is doing a pretty good job but China continues to do well as well.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's great. Thanks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Okay, it's Jim here. Just a clarification on one answer I gave on the Cooperative Agreement, our status there. The statement I made is an accurate statement. I guess I don't speak for NTIA. That process is theirs. But the statement is an accurate statement from VeriSign. I just wanted to be clear on that.","Operator","Thank you and that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

","Jim Bidzos","Thanks David and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter which kept the strong 2017 for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long term value to our shareholders. ","In 2017 VeriSign delivered strong financial performance reporting $1.165 billion in revenues, resulting in $653 million in free cash flow and generating full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margins of 65.3%. 2017 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base, in which the company processed 36.7 million registrations and finished the with 146.4 million links. During the year we marked more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. Also last year we renewed the .net registry agreement for another 6 years until 2023. ","During the quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.3 million for $145 million. during the full year 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $593 million. Effective today the board of directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $586 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program which have no expression. ","Our final position in strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $146.4 million, consisting of 131.9 million names for .com and 14.5 million names for .net. During the fourth quarter we processed 9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 0.57 million names. During the quarter we continue to see strength from domestic registrars which was offset by a lower second time renewal rate associated with the remaining China surge names from late 2015. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be 72.2%. ","We expect full year 2018 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 3%. For the first quarter we expect an increase to the domain name base of between 1.5 million to 2 million registrations. I would like to comment now on a recent positive development in our efforts to become the registry operator for .web. You may have seen the 8K we filed in January, in it we disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice's anti-trust division notified us that it had closed its investigation regarding the .web top level domain. ","We're now engaged in ICANN process to move the delegation of .web forward. However as this is ICANN's process we cannot say when it will conclude and while it's possible that our operation of .web will commence this year the 2018 revenue guidance we will provide does not include any revenue from .web. Of course, we will provide with updates as appropriate.","And now I would like to turn the call over to George. ","George Kilguss","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2107 the company generated revenue of 1.165 million up 2% from 2016 and delivered GAAP operating income of 708 million up 3% from 687 million for the full year 2016. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $296 million, up 3.2% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. ","During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customer abroad. As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $176 million compared with $169 million in fourth quarter 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 59.7% compared to 59% in the same quarter a year ago.","Net income totaled $103 million compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter last year. As of December 31, 2017, the company maintained total asset of 2.9 billion and total liabilities of 4.2 billion. Assets included 2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalence and marketable securities of which 729 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. ","I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. And then we'll discuss our 2018 full year guidance. ","As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation totaled $106 million compared to $97 million last quarter and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. ","Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as we had indicated on our last call primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2016. ","Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.3 million shares. This compares to the $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1 last quarter based on $125.5 million and $124.1 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. ","Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 25.2 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with $20.6 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 24 million shares last quarter. ","The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the $1.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $199 million and free cash flow was $190 million compared with $205 million and $198 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year. ","Now, I'd like to provide an update on implications to the company of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which I'll refer to as the Tax Act. ","As stated in today's earnings release, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million consisting of onetime U.S. taxes on cumulative foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related for withholding taxes. Both net of applying previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. This expense is offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act. ","As a result of the onetime U.S. taxes on cumulative foreign earnings we also intend to repatriate by early in the second quarter of 2018 approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of foreign withholding taxes based on current exchange rates. ","Additionally, on a go-forward basis due to the Tax Act, annual earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed by the U.S. This allows for annual repatriation without further U.S. taxation of distributable capital reserves from foreign entities. The taxation of foreign earnings and withholding taxes associated with ongoing repatriations will increase cash taxes over the amount the company has historically paid. ","Also, the lower corporate tax rates and limitations on the deductibility of interest implemented by the Tax Act, decreases the value of future interest expense deductions. In light of the Tax Act, we're presently evaluating our capital structure including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures. ","Finally, since mid-2017, we've used a tax rate of 25% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead we believe the more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. As a result, we will begin to use 22% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2018 non-GAAP results. ","With respect to full year 2018 guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of 1,195 million to 1,215 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $115 million and $122 million. ","Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million, and finally cash taxes are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. This 2018 cash tax guidance reflects our best estimate of the various impacts of the Tax Act including the impacts of our intended repay reaction. ","In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2017.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Bidzos","Thank you, George. 2017 was another solid year for VeriSign, there was further expansion of the domain name based and revenues, we generated an efficiently return value to shareholders, we renewed the .net registry agreement for another six years until 2023 and we mark more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. ","Finally, or early with this year we discuss that the U.S. Department of Justice notified as closed it investigation regarding the .net top level domain. We continued our work to protect grow advance of business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We think our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution in extent the long-term lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. ","We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. ","Gregg Moskowitz","In the third quarter the top five keyword searches for .com and while some form of crypto currency and black chain, how incremental do you think crypto has been in driving .com growth as over the past several months or so. ","Jim Bidzos","I don\u2019t think I have it at the tip of my fingers that pr\u00e9cis numbers but I don\u2019t believe that they are materially, I've seen a lot of activity in the secondary markets of trading in comp registrations that have crypto in them. But I don\u2019t think that there are any meaningful direct contributions to new net registrations in the numbers that we've reported. ","There is just a huge amount of interest in cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin as you know now that it has the exchanges. And what we've seen I would say specifically is a spike in value in the secondary market of -- any multiple keyword names with crypto in them. ","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, thanks Jim. And then George, you have told us that you would spend more in marketing Q4 and did and then I know I'm dating myself here, but I would have to go all the way back to 2007 to find another quarter where sales and marketing expense grew this much in absolute dollars on a sequential basis. So, can you maybe just sort of give a little bit more color on the activities that you undertook in Q4 as well as what the sales and marketing strategy is for 2018?","George Kilguss","Sure. I mean keep in mind though on an annual basis, our total marketing expense is pretty flat year-over-year. As I talked about few quarters ago, we clearly look to execute on marketing programs, that we think drive the best returns for the company and sometimes those programs we have to pivot during the year and we had lighter marketing expenses as we've talked about in the middle of 2017 and we finally got some programs coming out. We didn't make a little bit of a shift away from some register our marketing programs to more direct marketing programs. We did some advertising for our brands both .com and .net both domestically and abroad. And so, we've been doing a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that. And those programs came out in the fourth quarter and will continue to run in the first half of 2018 here.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, great. And then just one last question for me. Can you expand on why your cash taxes are so much higher in 2018? And as part of that is the [indiscernible] tax yield associated with the convert? Is that less valuable going forward under tax reform?","George Kilguss","Yes. So as mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a GAAP perspective, we made an accrual for the onetime transition tax and that was partially offset by the revaluation of our DTLs and from a GAAP perspective that was about $9 million. ","From a cash tax perspective, as you mentioned we're guiding to $70 million to $90 million in 2018 and that's up from about $28 million this year. As mentioned this reflects a variety of the impacts from the Tax Act including the impacts of our impended repatriation. And while I don't think it make sense with all the puts and takes with the tax calculation, I think the big items impacting the company from a cash tax perspective going forward are really the tax on foreign earnings, the U.S. tax on foreign earnings and then the U.S. limitations on interest deductions partially offset by the U.S. tax rate but that amount does include impact as well from our repatriation. ","As far as interest limitations U.S. tax reforms clearly has diminished benefits for interest expense, there are some limitations there. And as a result, I mentioned we are looking at our entire capital structure, we're looking at it, we'll be evaluating it. And as our convert to part of that capital structure we'll look at them as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Rob Oliver with Baird. ","Matt Lemenager","Good afternoon this is Matt -- in for Rob. I realize I might be early, but just looking to see if there is any plan around .web? Maybe things around go-to-market, how that might look, any different than .com would you be doing extra marketing just to get that brand up and going. Any early thoughts I realize, no expectation in the guidance or anything but any early thoughts. ","Jim Bidzos","I think it's just too early at this point to discuss any details about go-to-market or launch plan for .web. because an ICANN process that we are now engaged in with Department of Justice having closed their investigation of .web and when that process completes, I'm sure we will have a lot more to say but at this point would just be premature. ","Matt Lemenager","And on the expectations for domain growth 2% to 3% for this year, any difference in the expectations for U.S. versus international, I know you talked about strength in the economy in the United States and that the China phenomenon has kind roll of, I don\u2019t know if any of the international markets were starting to come back. ","George Kilguss","In 2017 we absolutely have seen a good U.S. market but have been said that European markets have also done well for us, our expectation is that we will see good growth in both U.S. and international markets next year but we don\u2019t guide to the specific markets over their performances. ","Matt Lemenager","Got it and the last question I had, on the repatriation. Would it be fair to assume that the primary use case would be for share repurchases or do you think there would be other avenues that you would look to deploy the repatriated cash?","George Kilguss","Well, I think in general, I don\u2019t think there will be a change in how we approach capital allocation. As always, we look to need to business using our strategic frame work of protect, grow and manage and we do what we think is best for the business. As you may recall our strategic frame work includes making sure we maintain and adequate amount of liquidity for the business both today and for tomorrow, what we think the needs are to continue to invest in our protect mission for the network and our business for today and tomorrow, to invest in technology and innovation that we think will drive profitable growth for the business and then once we accomplish those goals, we then evaluate how much excess capital we think appropriate to return to shareholders and in what form. We think that frame work which we have been using for the past six years as service well and we will continue to use that frame work as it relates to the capital corporation. ","Operator","We will go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. ","Ugam Kamat ","This is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. So, Jim, you mentioned that the renewal rate out of China was disappointing, especially the second-time renewal rate. So just wondering what was the renewal rate especially in China? Like you gave the blended renewal rate, but just wondering, what was the renewal rate in China? And how many names are left? And what would be the future renewal rates that you expect to come out from this region?","George Kilguss","We don\u2019t guide renewal rates by country as mentioned the cohort that was originally from the 2015 China search that cohort was about 1.4 million names coming into the year and that renewal rate was probably out of blended basis may be about 40%, for that cohort. So, we did have a portion of those names come out, however we were anticipating that, we did comment on that last quarter and that was in the guidance that we gave and we fell within the range of the guidance but most of that cohort now is I would say through the system if many material names. I would expect renewal rates to go back to more normalized rates. ","Ugam Kamat ","All right, perfect. That's helpful. And secondly, since we are coming closer to the Cooperative Agreement date in October, any particular update that you can give us on the process that you're having with the Department of Commerce? Or any particular survey that they might have done to allow the renewal of Cooperative Agreement or just allow it to expire?","Jim Bidzos","Well, first of all, I guess just to remind everybody on the call. In late September 2016, NTIA approved the .com registry agreement to be extended to November 30, 2024. At that time, NTIA chose not to extend the cooperative agreement. So, it is currently scheduled to terminate on November 30, 2018. Whether to extend that cooperative agreement or not as NTIA's decision and their process. And so, I can't comment on that. they have the right to conduct the public interest review for the sole purpose of terminating whether or not they will exercise their right to extend the term of the cooperative agreement. ","Now one update that is new since the last time we've talked is that David Redl was confirmed as the assistant secretary and administrator of the NTIA in that November of 2017. Unfortunately, there is no update I can give you there, we can't comment on Mr. Redl's appointment or the NTIA in regard to their progress related to the cooperative agreement that's theirs not ours. As soon as we can, we'll share whatever information we do have though. ","Operator","we'll take our last question from Walter Pritchard with Citi. ","Walter Pritchard","Hi thank. I think all my questions have been answered. Just one I wanted to make sure I clarified. On the tax scenario that you've outlined the $70 million to $90 million in the tax reform out of 22%. Does that contemplate within in the convert. And if not does the redeem of the convert potentially have additional tax impact beyond what you've talked about. ","George Kilguss","So, Walter as I mentioned, we're just evaluating our convertible debentures in conjunction with evaluating our capital structure. So, we're still looking at that. So, our guidance is really based on where we see today or what we're doing it, it's doesn't involve looking at any changes from that fact. We're still evaluating it. ","Walter Pritchard","And then is that 70 to 90 cash tax rate, it sounds like that doesn't mean, most companies are talking about having an 8 year [Technical Difficulty].","George Kilguss","Yeah so, I think you're referring to the transition tax, Tax Act allows you to look at your taxes and what they would have been with the Tax Act or without. So, it's a with or without calculation. And for us when we do that calculation, we expect to actually defer that amount of tax over the 8 years allowed by the Tax Act. ","Walter Pritchard","Okay. So, the 70 to 90 will that be a pretty good number of the next say several years. That include that 8-year period too?","George Kilguss","So, as we mentioned previously, we don't guide to a long-term cash tax rate. However, I would say in the short term we expect that that rate to still be below our GAAP tax rate as we use up foreign tax credits. At the end of 2017 we had about $122 million of foreign tax credits. And we now expect to utilize those over the next 2 to 3 years.","Walter Pritchard","But the 70 to 90 does includes still the benefit of some of those foreign tax credits and then those would expire at some point here. ","George Kilguss","That\u2019s correct.","Walter Pritchard","Okay, any good detail on how much per year you can use of that 122?","George Kilguss","Like I said they will probably full utilize it over the next three years, so obviously you\u2019re using more up in the year one and two and probably less in year three but the utilization of FTC to be perfectly candid is somewhat complex and is depended on a variety of factors, so it\u2019s a little bit, clearly I have an idea of what they will be but it's probably premature to give that number because they can change overtime depending on how foreign income is recognized overseas.

Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter demonstrates that we're on track with our plans for 2013. We reported revenue of $239 million, which was 12% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $132 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new gross registrations during the second quarter and added 1.22 million net new names, bringing our name base to a total of 124.3 million .com and .net domain names.","Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework.","During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 7.1 million shares for $334 million. On July 24, 2013, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $519 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and remaining with no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","Also today, we announced an increase in registry domain name fees for .net, per our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2014, the registry fee for .net domain names will increase from $5.62 to $6.18.","I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the total base of registered domain names and common net was 124.3 million, consisting of 109.2 million for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 4.9% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we added 1.22 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.","In the first quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 73.2% compared with 73.9% for the first quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2013 will be approximately 72.4%. This rate compares to 72.9% for the second quarter of 2012.","In the last year, we've noted the ongoing effects of changes in search algorithms and macroeconomic headwinds on our renewal rates. These factors continue to have a more pronounced effect on first-time renewing rates. Our base has been maturing, and the renewal rate for previously renewed names has stayed relatively consistent, which are positive trends for the overall renewal rate. However, the softer first-time renewal rate is an offsetting factor. We cannot be certain of how long the renewal rate will be impacted by these factors.","In light of these factors, we expect the third quarter net names for .com and .net added to the base will be between 1 million and 1.4 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin with a discussion of our second quarter financial results. During the quarter, we generated $239 million, up 12% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $132 million, up 23% from $107 million in the second quarter of 2012. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.2% compared to 50% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $87 million compared to $68 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.42 for the second quarter last year.","As of June 30, 2013, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2.5 billion. Liabilities totaled approximately $2.8 billion at the quarter end. The second quarter balance sheet reflects the April 2013 issuance of $715 million in senior secured notes due 2023 and the repayment of $100 million in borrowings under our credit facility.","During the second quarter, our stock price continued to exceed the subordinated convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means the holder of the convertible debentures will continue to have the option of converting the debentures into common stock during the third quarter. Thus the balance sheet classification as current liabilities of these debentures remains the same, as recorded at the end of the first quarter. We will provide updates if the balance sheet classification or the availability of the holder's option to convert the debentures change in the future, should the stock price trigger not be reached.","I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2013 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $213 million for the second quarter. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 40% was from foreign customers. Revenue from both international and domestic sources in the second quarter grew approximately 12% year-over-year.","Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $856 million, a $44 million increase from the year-end 2012. Second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $9 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million compared with $96 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily attributable to increased marketing expenses in the second quarter.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter expanded to 58.9% compared to 54% in the same quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $92 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.58 compared to $0.45 in the second quarter of 2012 and $0.58 last quarter.","With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations. In 2013, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 159 million shares in the second quarter compared to 161 million shares in the first quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debenture was approximately 9.4 million shares based on the average share price during the second quarter, compared with 5.6 million for the same quarter in 2012. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 7.1 million shares repurchased during the second quarter.","Operating cash flow was $147 million for the second quarter compared to $151 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $135 million for the second quarter last year. Second quarter free cash flow was $132 million.","Regarding our international cash balances and how they interrelate with our international tax structure, this work is progressing, but remains ongoing. We expect to compete our work before the end of the year, and we will update you when appropriate, including during our third quarter earnings call.","Of the $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, approximately $630 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally. The approximate $1.37 billion in international cash has not been taxed at the U.S. level, and our assertion unchanged from prior quarters, is that this balance is indefinitely reinvested offshore.","With respect to 2013, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue and operating margin projections. Revenue for 2013 is now expected to be in the range of $952 million to $962 million, representing an annual growth rate of 9% to 10%. This is an increase from the $945 million to $960 million or a growth rate of 8% to 10%, as given on our last earnings call.","Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2013 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 58% and 59%. This is an increase from the guidance of at least 57%, as given on our last earnings call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $60 million and $62 million for 2013.","Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $60 million and $80 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q2 2012. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. During the second quarter, we continued our efforts to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders.","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jim, I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about some of the new product areas that you're exploring. You've, in the past, talked about that and patents as potentially additional sources of revenue. And I note that looks like your revenue this quarter was a bit above what we expected, modeling it off of the demand side and I'm wondering if any of these new product areas start to contribute in the quarter?","D. James Bidzos","Okay, thanks. So in our new product area, first of all, I don't know if you're referring specifically to NIA, but we don't report that separately, but we're pleased with the growth of our NIA business. Secondly, in the area of new products that are coming out of our R&D efforts, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making there. I've committed in earlier earnings calls to target a delivery of a new product or service during calendar 2013, and we still hope to be able to do that. So as to contributions to the revenue, I think that, that was part of your question. Certainly, NIA makes contributions to part of our revenue. But as I said, we don't report that separately.","Operator","And we will now go to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Harris Heyer","This is Harris Heyer for Phil. I was hoping that you could provide us with an update on your IP strategy that you first mentioned late last year?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, we mentioned last year that we would be reviewing our patent portfolio, and we continue to do that. We continue to add to our patent portfolio. We mentioned that we had over 200 patent applications and patents issued here in the U.S., that progress continues. We've added to that since the last call. We're currently in a review. We're not ready to say anything about where that review will take us, but we're conducting a review of how we can better utilize our intellectual property.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will now go to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to clarify on the renewal rate. Was it that the renewal rate on the new customers was lower? Or was the mix or the percentage of new customers renewing in the period simply higher?","George E. Kilguss","So Steve, this is George Kilguss. Thanks for the question. So the overall renewal rate for the second quarter, which is a preliminary renewal rate, is not final until 45 days after, was 72.4%. That renewal rate, year-over-year, which I think is the best comparison to look at, is down from 72.9% to about 72.4%. So we're a little under last year's renewal rate at this time. The renewal rate, sequentially, did decline, but the sequential decline is more a function of the fact that we have a lot more names coming up for renewal in the first and second quarter. And so that's primarily the reason for the consolidated decline. We also mentioned on the call that we are seeing some softness in the first-time renewal names -- renewing names. We had talked about this in our last quarter call as well, where the previously renewed name ratio is remaining relatively constant, but we're still seeing some pressure on the first-time renewing names.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Any speculations\/theory on why that might be happening?","George E. Kilguss","Well, I think it's really relates to a couple of factors. One, are primarily the factors that we've been talking about for several quarters now, which are changes in the algorithms, the search engine algorithms, as well as economic activities. We did see our international or our international renewal rate on first-time renewing rates come down a little bit more than our domestic, so there's a little more pressure overseas. But it really relates back to those macro and SEO algorithm changes.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then my next question is on the marketing spend, are you spending currently to drive the current .com business, or have you started to spend to seed for some of the new gTLDs that you'll be introducing here in the future?","D. James Bidzos","We're not -- the short and to your question is that most of the marketing efforts are the same as they have been throughout the beginning of the year, focused around .com and .net. We are preparing to roll out our IDNs that we've applied for. Nothing has been delegated yet. We hope that will happen sometime this year. There will be some, obviously, some marketing activities around those. But right now, it's mostly development activities.","Operator","And we will now go to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim, wondering if you just could talk briefly about your decision to raise .net pricing. This time around involved a smaller duration or smaller window, I should say, between price increases than I think we've ever seen before so I just wanted to get your thoughts there?","D. James Bidzos","I'm sorry, the part about the window, I didn't catch all of that.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","The window between price increases for .net, Jim?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, so basically, the contract with ICANN allows us to take an increase for .net on an annual basis with a 6-month notice period. And so under that provision of the Registry Agreement with ICANN for .net, we've taken that price increase.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and one thing I wanted to clarify on the renewal rate, and George, you had sort of talked about some that dynamic from a sequential basis, but I just wanted to make sure I understood, you were saying that the number of first-time renewals in Q2 was greater than Q1 and that's why there was a sequential change? Or was it something else?","George E. Kilguss","No, I was saying that the total number -- in Q1 and Q2, we tend to have more expiring names in the base than we do, say in Q3 and Q4. And so as you have more names expiring, the renewal rate has a tendency to dip, at least in recent periods, with the larger amount of names renewing in the quarter. But what I also said is some of the pressure is due to the first time renewing rate of first-time renewing names that is still under pressure.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And I guess, what I'm wondering, George, is if there's any dynamic that has changed between Q1 and Q2 when I was asking about sequential? And maybe a better way to ask it is, where there any meaningful search algorithm changes that were made more recently that might have had an effect on renewal rate? Or was that not the case?","George E. Kilguss","So there was one algorithm change in the quarter. So in mid to late May, Google made an algorithm change to their Penguin -- their Penguin algorithm. It affected -- I think it affected about 2.3% of queries in general. That's probably a little less than what their first one came out a year ago, which affected about 3% of queries. So there was an algo change. With that, it's difficult for us to see the direct correlation. We do know that change happened, we keep on eye on it. Did that have a direct correlation? I don't have quite that visibility of data to tell that but I do know that, that did happen in the quarter.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Then just finally, Jim, on the new detailed e-front -- so there continues to be some back-and-forth between ICANN and constituents, but it also looks like there's been some real progress recently with the 2013 registry agreement recently signed. And I think you talked about hopefully getting lift off on the IDN before the end of the year. What additional processes or potential obstacles, I guess, are we looking at between now and then?","D. James Bidzos","Sure. ICANN just had their meeting last week in Durban, South Africa. And they did sign 4 new Registry Agreements and a new gTLD program for IDNs. And as to whether what track or timing the program is on, I think, first of all, ICANN is dealing with couple of issues. One is back in Beijing, at the prior meeting, in April, ICANN was given a communiqu\u00e9 from the Governmental Advisory Committee that I think had them sort of addressing a number of issues for new gTLDs. That continued in Durban, with further discussions between ICANN and its GAC, Governmental Advisory Committee, on the advice that they provided on productions around a broad category of applied 4 strings. So I think that's a factor. There are some security instability issues that are being addressed. ICANN hired a very competent, qualified contractor to do a security study that was presented in Durban, If you're interested in that, I'd point you to ICANN's website, where there's audio available of the presentation, of that report and a Q&A session that I think would help you understand that. And then -- so those things are affecting ICANN's rollout. In Durban they also said that the earliest date for the first delegation, assuming all goes well, would be early in September. So that's basically the most recent status that we have.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will now got to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I wanted to start with growth decelerates in the second half as we lose some of the tailwind from the last .com price increase and I think there's a discussion that many of us are having about what is the long-term growth rate for VeriSign look like in absence of price increases on .com? So when you think about new gTLDs, you think about the adding of new products, et cetera, is there a sense that you can give us? Do you think we see reacceleration off of what the growth rate at the back half looks like? And what kind of investment will be necessary to support that? Meaning, what could we think about, just generally, would happen to margins?","D. James Bidzos","Okay, let me sort of break that up into 2 questions and I'll address part of it and maybe George can address part of it. First of all, ICANN's new gTLD program, as we've mentioned before, offers us several growth opportunities. First of all, there are the 14 applications that we've made ourselves, 12 of those are IDNs, foreign script variance for common net, so we think that's a growth opportunity for us. In addition, we have roughly 200 strings that are applied for in the new gTLD program, for which VeriSign will be the contracted back-end registry service provider, so we think that's a growth opportunity. We have been very active and working very hard in new initiatives, including some work in a new laboratory that we started last year. We're pleased with the progress we're making there. As I said, we hope to announce the first new product or service this year. And -- so that's one area, where I think we'll be able to introduce new growth. We did, of course, just today announce a price increase for .net. With that price increase, I might add, at $6.18 for a .net name, that registration is still extremely competitive compared to other gTLDs that are out there today. Even .com at $7.85 is below most of the existing or announced prices for existing gTLDs. So all of those offer us opportunities for growth. Then there's the future rate of growth in the zone, which I think was a part of your question as well and I'll invite George to comment there.","George E. Kilguss","Yes, sure. So, Sterling, as you're aware, we don't give guidance beyond just the current year. When earlier in the year, when we gave our initial guidance, we talked about the zone growing between 4% to 6%. We're seeing now that the zone year-to-date has been about 4.9% year-over-year growth. And so, we're looking to see the zone at least for '13 to be somewhere between 4% and 5%. That's where the zone is currently trending. You talked about profitability. As we roll out some of these new initiatives, as we've talked previously, we look for certain quality of revenues. So we're looking at business opportunities and new initiatives that have similar qualities of revenue as our existing business: stability, visibility, profitability. And so those are the characteristics we're looking for, for new investment in the business. We've talked about the new gTLD program, the brand that we're looking to represent, as well as the new IDNs. And we've been making those or have made a lot of those investments already in the business and don't expect a significant amount of cost increase in taking those new opportunities on. Now, it looks like some of those may be delayed a little bit longer than anticipated based on some of the comments coming out of ICANN, but we still look to participate in those initiatives, as well as looking at our patent portfolio and some new ideas coming out of the hive in subsequent years.","D. James Bidzos","And I'm sorry, I will just add to that as well that all of the growth opportunities that I laid out, the IDNs, the back end Registry Services, new products and services that we might introduce, essentially, the cost of developing all of these new initiatives are baked into to the current business plan and all of the guidance that we provide, if that helps.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Absolutely. You mentioned, Jim, the -- a couple of approvals of new registries for IDNs. Has anybody given any sense as to what we might expect in terms of pricing on any of the new IDNs or new gTLDs?","D. James Bidzos","I think the short answer to that is no. I would add that while ICANN did sign 4 contracts for IDNs, I believe that there are some conditions associated with those. I think if you got to the website, you'll see that there were some exhibits that the applicants signed in addition to the contracts that essentially say that governmental advisory committee advice and security and stability issues could introduce changes that will change that contract. And so, even though those contracts resigned, there were side agreements attached to them that are on ICANN's website that you can look at that point out that they're subject to changes in a very fluid situation. But I'll let Pat comment -- but I'm not aware of anybody who's announced any pricing at this point.","Patrick S. Kane","No, all the applications that were submitted has financials, which were redacted from when the applications were published, so we have no visibility into that.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and last question. Jim, you mentioned NIA. I know you don't break it out specifically, but qualitatively, can you talk about maybe which areas outperformed in the quarter?","D. James Bidzos","Go ahead, George, I'm sorry.","George E. Kilguss","I mean, Sterling, I would say it continues to meet our expectation. It's performing well year-over-year. We still see growth in all of the products that we offer for sale in that mainly DDoS, as well as MDNS and our iDefense business. We continue to see good growth of that in our business performing line with our expectations.","Operator","And we will go to our last question of Jaimin Soni with Bank of America.","Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question for George, first. If I'd look at the second half of the year, George, can you just help me understand a little bit about how you expect renewal rates to trend? And when you're looking at the new domains that are coming in, can you give a rough estimation of how many are international versus U.S.?","George E. Kilguss","So on your last point, the U.S. versus international, as I mentioned in the script, about 60% of our business is domestic and about 40% is international from a revenue perspective, and that flows pretty much down to the domains, as you might imagine, from a break out perspective. So that has been relatively consistent over the past several quarters, so I don't see a significant change in that mix for the rest of this year. As far as the renewal rate trends, again, that's something we're looking at. We've given the preliminary renewal rate here to second quarter of 2013 of 72.4%, and that's something we're keeping an eye on, the renewal rates. There is a little bit of seasonality if you go back and look at the quarterly renewal rate, it does bounce around depending on the amount of names that are coming up for renewal in a particular quarter. What I can tell you is the amount of expiring names in Q3 is 24.9 million names that are expiring in the quarter and will come up for renewal.","Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, okay. And one quick one for Jim. It seems like the IDN opportunity is to move to a near term of when it comes to the new domain name side of things. Is it possible to just give some parameters on how we can think about the sizing of the TAM here?","D. James Bidzos","Are you talking specifically about VeriSign's own applications for IDNs?","Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","D. James Bidzos","Well we've made applications for 12 strings that are IDNs for variations of .com and .net and essentially the largest market opportunities, China, India, Japan, Korea and a handful of others. We haven't -- I think it's early for us to say until we actually start marketing and get approval for the IDNs what the potential for that would be. We've not finalized and issued any pricing associated with that. We did send a letter to ICANN clarifying a little bit about our marketing strategy, which I think is reasonable to define as sort of a brand extension strategy, I'll bypass the comments on that as well, but I'm afraid there's really, at this point, it's hard -- it's too early to project the size of the opportunity, but in places like China and India, where there are very large populations of Internet users, who are not English speakers, I certainly think there is an opportunity, but I'll let Pat comment as well.","Patrick S. Kane","So .com, .C-O-M, really has great brand awareness around the globe and some of the issues that we will -- that we're about to contend with is the penetration we have with our own brands and the adoption rate of what the local transliterations will look like. And the second piece is, that we talked about this in the past, IDNs are still not completely ubiquitous in terms of their capabilities within desktop and mobile software. So there's still some challenges in that particular area right now. So the growth is kind of -- we're excited about it, but in terms of what the total opportunity looks like, there's still some challenges that define that.","D. James Bidzos","There's some infrastructure development that still has to occur before they are fully functional in all of the applications. But there's a tremendous amount of interest, there is growing support. A lot of application developers have committed to support IDNs. There's a lot of activity in developing standards for interoperability between applications to support IDNs. And as I mentioned, I think that for brands that market in those geographies where you have a large population of Internet users who are native -- not English speakers, I think there's certainly an opportunity for them to market to those folks through IDN. So we think it's a good opportunity, but unfortunately, at this time, it's a bit early to try to size the market and since we haven't -- we don't have approval yet for the IDNs. They're not delegated and we haven't published pricing. It's just a bit early to really go farther than that.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead sir.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.","This call and our presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.","The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterwards we will open the call for your questions.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 was marked by strong financial performance during, which we generated revenues of $1,215 million, $661 million in free cash flow and 2018 full year non-GAAP operating margin of 67.5%.","2018 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as the company processed 38.2 million registrations and finished the year with 153 million names. During the year, we marked more than 21 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.","As we announced on November 1, last year VeriSign and the Department of Commerce entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement. The amendment among other things permits VeriSign without further approval of the DOC to engage with ICANN to change the .com Registry Agreement to increase wholesale prices for .com domain name registrations and renewals by up to 7% in each of the last four years of each six-year period.","Amendment 35 also clarifies that the vertical integration restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement on VeriSign's ability to own an ICANN-accredited registrar apply only as to the .com TLD and not to other services offered by VeriSign. Additionally, Amendment 35 also removes certain unnecessary and burdensome regulations, so that any future renewal of the .com Registry Agreement can occur without DOC approval unless VeriSign were to seek changes to certain key provisions such as further changes to pricing.","Any change to the Cooperative Agreement can only be made by mutual agreement of VeriSign and the DOC except that the DOC can terminate the Cooperative Agreement at any time with 120 days' notice prior to the expiration of the term.","As another update, the company completed the sale of the Verisign Security Services customer contracts on December 5, 2018. These contracts are related primarily to our DDoS and Managed DNS customers.","As discussed last quarter, the sale of these non-core customer contracts will enable us to focus solely on supporting our core mission ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. Of course, the sale of these customer contracts will be a slight drag on revenue in 2019, but our continued organic revenue growth from our core domain name business is expected to offset this decrease.","At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 153 million consisting of 139 million names for .com and 14 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.5%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.29 million names.","Although, the renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Looking forward to 2019, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.25% and 4.25% for full year 2019. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.2 million shares of common stock for $175 million. During the full year 2018, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $600 million.","Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $603 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.","Our financial position remains strong with $1.27 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the company generated revenue of $1.215 billion, up 4.3% from 2017 and delivered GAAP operating income of $767 million, up 8.4% from $708 million in 2017. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $307 million, up 4% year-over-year and up by 5.5% sequentially.","As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $194 million compared with $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.1% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter a year ago.","Net income totaled $182 million compared to $103 million a year earlier, which produced dilutive earnings per share of $1.50 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.83 for the same quarter last year.","In the quarter, we recorded a $54.8 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of Verisign Security Services customer contracts. This gain increased GAAP net income by $52 million and GAAP earnings per share by $0.43.","As of December 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $504 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.","I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide our 2019 full year guidance.","As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million compared to $96 million last quarter and $106 million in the fourth quarter a year ago.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 66.7% compared to 68.7% last quarter and 64.1% in the same quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter, our sales and marketing expense increased sequentially as we had additional spend on programs in the market.","Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $191 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 121.3 million shares. This compares to $1.23 last quarter and $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2017.","The gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts increased non-GAAP net income by $42.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.36 during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $219 million and free cash flow was $211 million, compared with $199 million and $190 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year.","Now I'd like to provide our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 2.25% and 4.25%, being partially offset by the loss of our revenue associated with the sale of our Security Service customer contracts.","Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5% and will continue to include certain non-material operating costs associated with providing transition services for Security Service customers. Our interest expense and non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consist primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by payments collected as part of the aforementioned Transition Services Agreement.","Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $95 million and $115 million. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance in 2018 during the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Bidzos","Thank you, George. 2018 was another solid year for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues. We generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders. We entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, allowing VeriSign to engage with ICANN to amend the COM Agreement to increase the price for com domain name registrations and renewals without further approval from the Department of Commerce.","We concluded the sale of our Security Services customer contracts, further increasing our focus and efforts to protect, grow and manage this unique business. The success in our core business benefits our customers employees and shareholders.","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And first we'll hear from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi guys. So, ICANN 35 certainly is beneficial for you guys. But given all the moving parts, can you just simply explain what is different?","Jim Bidzos","Sure Sterling. I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com. We have more flexibility on vertical integration for services that are not .com services and there is reduced regulatory burden for both VeriSign and the government.","I think your question is in practice what will be different for us VeriSign. So, I'll contrast a process before and after Amendment 35. But let me just -- let me start with what will not change. Every six years, we engage with ICANN on a .com Registry Agreement renewal for which there's a presumptive Right of Renewal. That is not changed and the next renewal of the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN will occur in November of 2024. Some parts of the agreement may be changed in that process through negotiation. However, I'd note that ICANN has not historically negotiated pricing with us deferring to DOC on pricing in prior renewals.","That process -- that ICANN process is unchanged. Prior -- to pick up there, prior to Amendment 35, the process that followed that renewal with ICANN was that we would present the .com Registry Agreement as negotiated by us, VeriSign and ICANN to the DOC. DOC would then review it based on a two-pronged test of one, our performance on security and stability and two, a review of whether we were \"providing registry services on reasonable prices terms and conditions.\"","And a standard applied for these tests was called the public interest standard and then DOC's consent to the COM Registry Agreement renewal following this review was required. So, they have to consent to what we had done with ICANN.","Amendment 35 founded in the public interest to allow the following; first one for us to raise .com registration and renewal prices 7% in the back four years of each six-year period; two, that the restriction on vertical integration was only intended to apply to .com; three, that the review process is now streamlined such that any NTIA review any DOC review and consent is no longer required provided that the COM Registry Agreement has not changed pricing from what's now allowed, specifically, the 7% noted -- I noted a minute ago. Also that the performance specs or SLAs in the COM Registry Agreement that we have to perform to have not been changed and also that we've not changed the vertical integration restriction on COM and that we have not changed the renewal or termination terms of the COM Registry Agreement; and five, that there's been no changes to the WHOIS services.","Given all of those then consent from the NTIA or DOC to the renewal of the COM Registry Agreement is not required if these terms are not changed. So, further in such a case and absent any VeriSign and DOC mutually agreed changes, the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew, again, without reviewing consent as is for another six-year term.","So, one could see the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew again without reviewing consent as is for another 6-year term. So one could see the Cooperative Agreement now as evergreen without further review, given the terms stay the same. NTIA has also a right to terminate the Cooperative Agreement on 120 days' notice before the end of the term.","So there is one other change which is that VeriSign agrees to quote, continue to operate the .com registry in a content-neutral manner, which of course we've always done. So that's basically Amendment 35 and what will be different for us although of course parts of the Cooperative Agreement including earlier amendments that had to be modified or deleted to make Amendment 35 work were also changed. But essentially that's it. Long answer sorry about that but...","Sterling Auty","That's okay. But two -- I know these calls are relatively short typically so I'm going to take the opportunity to ask a couple of questions to follow up on it. The first one is, so the Cooperative Agreement has changed, but I haven't seen any news. Do you have to go back and actually refresh or change the .com Registry Agreement to now incorporate the same pricing parameters that's there in Item 35? Or is that kind of already de facto happened because of what you did with Item 35?","Jim Bidzos","Well historically and in this case as well there is a process for that. There's a process for moving changes from the DOC to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com Registry Agreement. ICANN has historically as I mentioned deferred to the U.S. government on matters relating to com pricing.","But ICANN and VeriSign have an agreement to cooperate and negotiate -- there's a written agreement to operate -- cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the com registry as may be necessary for consistency with changes to the Cooperative Agreement.","So we have begun that process with ICANN to amend the agreement to make these changes including pricing. And I don't think I can comment further to process. We've been through it a few times. It may take a number of months to work through it, but we'll update you as appropriate.","Sterling Auty","All right, great. And then on the vertical integration, the way that I read that if we look back through the history of Network Solutions to VeriSign to where you are today once upon a time you were both registry and registrar. This appears to open up the ability for you to be a registrar as long as it's not for .com. Is this indicating that you would be interested in entering and becoming a registrar again, perhaps for the .web?","Jim Bidzos","Well first of all it was -- as I mentioned earlier this is a clarification that, that restriction only applies to .com. So .web or any other services that we offer technically are no longer covered with this modification.","How that language would apply to our business, how we would use it, how it stands today? I think is it's too early to say how that flexibility might be applied, if it's applied. But that clarification is now made and the vertical integration restriction only applies to .com.","And you're right, we did have both when we acquired Network Solutions in June of 2000. And then I think it was in 2003 or early 2004 we sold off the registrar. But I think at that time the agreement read that VeriSign couldn't be vertically integrated. And I think at that time VeriSign and .com were entirely synonymous, so this clarifies that and it applies -- the restriction only applies to .com, and as I said, too early to say how or if we'll use that flexibility.","Sterling Auty","All right, great. Let me turn it over. And I will hop back in queue. Thank you.","Jim Bidzos","I am sorry.","Sterling Auty","I was saying, thank you I will turn the call over to next question.","Operator","And it looks like our last question will come from Rob Oliver with Baird.","Matt Lemenager","Thanks. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob tonight. Guys, is there any update on .web kind of what are the remaining steps there? I know that's a process. Could you kind of help us understand what the remaining steps would be there? And then secondly on .web, what type of factors are you using to evaluate potential pricing there and what that might look like? Because I think we understand, it can be unlimited or I guess unrestricted and you can charge premium pricing like you've talked about in the past. So are there any examples of what you're using to evaluate what that premium pricing might look like?","Jim Bidzos","Thanks for the questions. So, first of all, the update that I can offer since we last spoke on the process towards delegation of .web is that one of the losing bidders in the .web auction a company named Afilias who is one of our competitors has filed an arbitration against ICANN trying to continue to delay the process. We are not parties to that arbitration yet, but we are actively seeking to join and participate in it. About your question, about pricing and what we might do two parts to that answer.","Number one is, yes .web is not a regulated TLD like .com is or even like .net is. It's a TLD that would be operating under the new form the new so-called New gTLD Registry Agreement. And those agreements do not limit pricing similar to our IDNs, which are also signed up to the same form of agreement. They only require 6-month notice for any price change, but they provide complete pricing flexibility. As to what we would do, how we would do premium pricing, how we would price .web, how we're thinking about it, I think it's very premature at this stage really to say anything.","And it just occurs to me too that back to Sterling's second question, he asked about, how we would use vertical integration, just to be complete. That ICANN process of incorporating all the Amendment 35 changes into the .com Registry Agreement pricing et cetera also applies to these other changes the clarification of what vertical integration restriction actually exists et cetera, so all that is subject to completing this process with ICANN that I described earlier.","And I apologize I'd like to tell you more about .web, but it's just premature to talk about what we would do or how we're thinking about that at this point. But your assumptions about the flexibility that .web would offer based on the agreement, it would operate under are correct. It would not be restricted and we'd have flexibility to price premiums or whichever way we chose.","Matt Lemenager","Okay. That's helpful color. And then on the -- the next one's kind of high level. But so the domain name base for growth for 2019 the 2.25% to 4.25%, what could you tell us about what geographies are North America or international? Not looking for specific numbers or anything, but what kind of pockets of strength are you expecting there? Or which parts might be more of a headwind? Anything just directionally, no specific numbers, but what markets kind of look like they might be driving that?","George Kilguss","Well what I can tell you Matt is that in 2018 as we've been talking about all year, we've seen good growth from registrars in both the U.S. registrars, in both registrars located over in the China market. So those at least in 2018 have been good markets for us for growth. As you talk about 2019, obviously we're a global business. We factor a lot of things going on into our range. But we still expect as you -- as we talked about the domain name base to grow between 2.25% up to 4.25%. So just exactly where that growth is, I mean we're not giving a specific guidance there but we do see that there's been a good growth this year and we're looking for growth in the range that we outlined in our guidance.","Matt Lemenager","Okay. Sounds good. Thanks guys. I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sterling","Operator","And it looks like we will be taking our final questions a follow-up from Sterling with JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Thanks. We could just do this as an open forum and go back and forth. Just a couple more. I wanted to ask, I get a number of questions actually on the cash taxes and the cash tax rate. So if I just do the simplistic and look at the cash taxes here for 2019, how should we think about -- actually maybe I'll just leave it to you, how should we think about the cash tax rate both in 2019 and going forward? Is this structural and it can maintain this rate? Or should it elevate to some other level? And what would be the driving factors to that?","George Kilguss","Yeah, thanks for that Sterling. So as you know in 2018, cash taxes were about $85 million and that translates to about 12% effective cash tax rate and that's compared to our GAAP taxes of about $147 million, which if you do that math that translated into an effective tax rate of about in the low-20% range.","So for 2019 as you know we've guided cash taxes to be between $95 million to $115 million. And if you do that math that still would be below our GAAP effective tax rate. And that's the result because we're still using up some foreign tax credits and state NOLs. And while we don't provide a long-term cash tax rate, we do expect our cash tax effective rate to accrete closer up to our GAAP effective rate over the next few years as we fully utilize those remaining attributes.","Sterling Auty","Excellent. And then the last one for me. You increased the share repurchase. I missed what you said. How much was left at the end of the quarter for repurchase before you went to the -- to $1 billion? And what was the thought in terms of the timing of now to expand? Because a lot of people wonder if you would lever up again and maybe get even more aggressive on the repurchase front?","George Kilguss","So, before we went back for authorization, we were just under $400 million remaining under that program before we went to the board and had it reauthorized up to $1 billion.","Sterling Auty","All right. Great. And then just that last part of it. Maybe an update on what your thought is around optimal capital structure the potential to maybe add debt and be a little bit more aggressive this year within that buyback.","George Kilguss","Yeah. As you know, Sterling we constantly review the needs of the business and we try to make our decisions that are in the best interest of the company. And as we've talked about many times that's a pretty active process we go through each quarter. Jim and I sit down and look at the specific needs. We don't have a specific leverage target that we manage to. We try to use our protect grow and manage framework to make sure that we're maintaining the optimal level of liquidity.","At present, we're looking ahead to what investment opportunities we need to make the business grow and then we're thinking about what the appropriate return of capital is to shareholders. And so, I don't really have anything to report at this time. We continue to look at the marketplace and then what the needs of the business are and we'll continue to do that in a very active fashion.","Jim Bidzos","Yes and Sterling, Jim here. I would just add too that Amendment 35 was a significant event for us and in 2018 and it does afford us additional flexibility in a number of different areas, and I think we've certainly talked about that enough. But just fully understanding it, and factoring it into our strategic thinking. I think is just something that we do need to consider. And so that's a process that's underway too. So, as George said there's just really nothing specific to say about at this point.","Sterling Auty","All right. Sounds good. Thank you, guys.","Jim Bidzos","Thanks.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for any final remarks.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we processed 8.4 million new registrations in Q2, a second quarter record, while adding 1.81 million net names, finishing the quarter with 118.5 million names in the domain name base. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash and marketable securities.","During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.9 million shares for $76 million. Thus far, in 2012, we have repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares or about $144 million, and we have approximately $687 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","On June 23, 2012, ICANN approved the renewal of VeriSign's agreement to service the operator of the .com registry for the term commencing on December 1, 2012, through November 30, 2018. As you may know, the .com renewal agreement terms, including the pricing provisions, are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights.","The U.S. Department of Commerce, under an agreement called the Cooperative Agreement, is now reviewing the renewal of the .com registry agreement. We expect their approval on the renewal of the .com agreement by November 30.","During the month of July, we marked 15 years of uninterrupted uptime for the .com and .net zone infrastructure. This is a tremendous achievement and I would like to recognize the efforts of our engineering and operation teams for meeting this milestone. We continue to make protecting our DNS infrastructure a priority, while continuing to meet and exceed requirements of our service-level agreements.","I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 103.7 million names, while .net equaled 14.8 million names. The total base of registered names in common net was approximately 118.5 million at the end of June. This represents increases of 7.8% year-over-year and 1.6% quarter-over-quarter.","In the second quarter, we added 1.81 million net names to the domain name base and we processed 8.4 million new registrations or a 4.2% increase in new registrations over the same period a year ago.","The first quarter of 2012 renewal rate was 73.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.9%. This rate compares to 73.1% achieved in the second quarter of 2011.","While Q2 is our second strongest quarter on record for new registrations, our net names added to the domain name base was at the low end of our guidance, primarily driven by what appears to be a softer-than-expected preliminary Q2 renewal rate. Our first time renewal rate was the main driver of the decrease in the preliminary second quarter renewal rate. First time renewal rates are driven by many factors, and 2 factors had incremental impacts in the second quarter.","First, search engine adjustments made over the past several months affected the economics, which drove domain monetization rates in the first half of 2012. While monetization rates have increased for better performing sites, lower performing sites do not seem to be benefiting. We believe that some of these first time renewing, lower performing sites did not renew during the quarter as a result of these changes, leading to the lower renewal rate. We have seen these search engine changes in the past and the resulting impacts on first time renewing names and our overall renewal rate. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted within several months.","Secondly, we also believe that some additional promotional activity by registrars during the middle of 2011 led to a lower first time renewal rate this year. We expect the third quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.6 million and 1.9 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality.","Also, please note that starting tonight, we will make available a summary of the number of active domain names registered in the .com and net registries and the number of .com and .net domain names that are registered but not configured for use in the respective top-level domain zone file. This information will be available from links on our corporate and Investor Relations website, which will also include definitions and explanations of the data. This additional information will continue to increase transparency into the overall size of common net zones as well as increase the frequency that this summary level information is available.","Our NIA business continues to exhibit steady year-over-year bookings growth. We are focusing our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue.","Now, let me turn over the call to our CFO, George Kilguss.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today and to now be part of the VeriSign team. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $214 million, up 13% from year-ago level and 4% sequentially. Of note, during the second quarter, revenue included an out-of-period adjustment that reduced revenue by reclassifying approximately $1.8 million from previously recognized revenue back into deferred revenue. Without this onetime reclassification, revenue would have approached $216 million in the quarter.","During the quarter, the company also delivered GAAP operating income of $107 million, up 30% from $82 million in the second quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 50%, up from 43% from the comparable period a year ago, which was a result of expenses remaining relatively flat from year-ago levels. GAAP net income totaled $68 million compared to a GAAP net loss of $11 million a year earlier.","As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of June 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion, of which $1.4 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of this $1.4 billion total, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.","Total liabilities were $2 billion as of the second quarter, up slightly from $1.9 billion at year end. Total debt on the balance sheet was $698 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under our $200 million credit facility and the $598 million present value of our $1.25 billion in convertible debentures. The convertible debentures will continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet to its $1.25 billion face value over its 25-year remaining term.","Let me now recap our performance for the second quarter for our key operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow, then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance.","As mentioned, revenue totaled $214 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign operations. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic-sourced revenue, which grew 11.6% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $804 million, a $75 million increase from year end and $90 million increase from the second quarter of 2011.","Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes $8.5 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million and was flat sequentially.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter continued to expand and totaled 54% compared to 51.9% in the first quarter of 2012. Our second quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to keep expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to improve our operating margin.","Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $74 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 compared to $0.38 in the second quarter of 2011 and $0.42 last quarter.","Now I would like to update you on our taxes. As mentioned earlier, our international markets are growing slightly faster than our domestic markets. As a result, the proportion of income being generated overseas is also increasing. Our foreign income is taxed at a lower marginal rate than our domestic income that we expect to see an improvement in our blended tax rate over time. Accordingly, we believe a more reasonable estimate of our non-GAAP tax rate would be 28% going forward, down from our previous estimate of 30%. We expect to use a 28% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting third quarter 2012 non-GAAP results.","In 2012, we now expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.","We had a weighted average diluted share count of 164 million shares in the second quarter compared to 163 million shares in the first quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 5.6 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.1 million shares from Q1. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q1 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.9 million shares repurchased during the current quarter.","Operating cash flow was $135 million for the quarter, up from $110 million in Q1 of this year and up compared to $13 million for the same quarter last year, which included a $100 million contingent interest payment to convertible bondholders. Free cash flow was $130 million for the second quarter of 2012, including $8 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $13 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.","With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $880 million, representing an annual growth rate of between 13% and 14%. We previously gave a range of $870 million to $890 million on the last call.","Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be at least 55%. We previously gave a lower range of 52% to 54% on our last call. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012 compared with the $38 million estimate given on our last call.","And finally, capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% and 8% of revenue. We gave a 7% to 10% range on the last call.","Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, we continue to experience solid performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. And before opening the call to your questions, I would like to share with you how we're thinking about the business across the 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively. First, we protect the business by providing unparalleled registry services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the Internet infrastructure which we operate. We'll also continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement.","Second, in addition to the organic growth of our Naming business, we see new gTLDs in our NIA business as adjacent potential growth opportunities.","Third, we continue to focus on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the domain name system.","And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We seek to run the business efficiently and effectively through managing costs and continued margin improvement.","We believe that delivering on these 4 areas with a right balance should provide unparalleled performance for our customers and create value for our shareholders.","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned the search engine changes heading the renewal rate, can you give us more color on that as well as was there anything else going on during the quarter that may have impacted the renewal rate?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, Sterling, it's Jim. We think there were 2 main things that drove the slight reduction in the renewal rate. First of all, we mentioned that promotion by a large registrar that was very aggressive and led to an unusually larger number of first time renewing names, which I think, coupled with the changes in the search algorithm were the primary contributors to the reduced renewal rate. The monetization community out there has a history. This has happened before. It happened, as you recall, in 2008, and they have a history of rebounding. They generally sort of adapted the changes after 1 quarter or 2 at most. So we expect that to happen in this case, and all of that is factored into the guidance that we gave.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. Great. And you mentioned the 8.4 million new names that were added, can you give us a sense whether maybe international versus domestic, what kind of trends you're seeing in the new name portion of the net names?","D. James Bidzos","Yes. First of all, we obviously don't guide that to new adds, but I will say that -- point out that 8.4","million names is a record for the second quarter and the second highest overall. And I would like George to comment on the impact of domestic versus international.","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Sterling. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're really seeing the international markets grow a little faster than domestically, and they grew 14.5% in the comparable period versus 11.6% domestically. So I think if you use those revenue growth rates, that should give you a consistent idea of the growth that we're seeing internationally versus domestic.","Operator","Our next question will come from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on margins and then just the domain name guidance. Obviously, you guys have another big margin quarter this quarter and you raised the full year outlook or, I guess, ending -- end-of-the-year outlook. When you think about just your margin structure here, can you give a sense just for anything sort of just the incremental margins are? And especially when you get into potentially the renewal season next year, what are some of the changes to the contract and incremental fees just if that changes at all? And in terms of just the guidance for Q3 for net adds, just wondering what was behind that? Did you assume somewhat lower first year renewal rates or just what was baked into that?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Winslow, this is George speaking. So with regard to operating margin, clearly, we just updated our guidance to exit fourth quarter at least 55%. I think if you look back historically at how we've done from a margin expansion perspective, it's really come from our revenue growth. We've historically been a pretty good shepherd of our funds and maintaining our operating expenses in line, while we've had growth in between marketing or in between R&D. You've seen, we've managed that expense pretty well. As it relates to net adds guidance, clearly, as Jim mentioned, there have been some changes in the search algorithm and that typically takes a few quarters to wash through. And so we're just reflecting that experience into our current guidance for Q3.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, Phil, this is Jim. I think you'd also asked about ICANN fees next year and its potential impact on margins. I guess I'll leave the math to everyone, but basically the changes in the ICANN .com contract took us from annual fees of roughly $17 million based on an alignment now. The change aligns us with their other registry agreements and it essentially puts us, based on a zone of roughly 100 million names, at about $25 million per year. So roughly $8 million additional ICANN fees in 2013 anticipated.","Operator","We'll now go to Walter Pritchard from Citi for our next question.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about the small reclassification of revenue back to deferred revenue. What was the driver there and is this something that could recur in the future?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Walter. The $1.8 million nonrecurring revenue charge was related to a system error of the seldom use feature in our revenue recognition database. One of our secondary controls caught the error in our quarterly review process and we made the out-of-period adjustment this quarter. We fixed that system issue, and we've actually implemented a number of additional processes and procedures to avoid this problem from recurring in the future.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just on the renewal rate, I guess, I understand we've seen the search engine changes in the past, and I'm just wondering why you only saw it in the first time renewals and not in the base. It would seem like there probably were some names in the base as well that might have been infected by changes to the search engine and might have also had a lower renewal rate as the result?","Patrick S. Kane","Yes, Walter this is Pat. So we did see it across both the first time renewing names and the previously renewed names, but we saw a larger impact in the first time renewing names.","Operator","And we'll now go to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","In terms of new gTLDs, did you run the expenses for those applications through the P&L this period? And is there anymore expense that we should expect from that in the future?","George E. Kilguss","Steve, no. We recorded most of that expense in Q1. There was, I think, one application that we did incur in Q2, but most of that hit our sales and marketing expense last quarter.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then I wonder if you could just talk maybe qualitatively about your thoughts on the timing of the next price increase, what kind of considerations would go into that?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, this is Jim. Well, I think it's a bit early probably for us to talk about that. I think every time an opportunity comes for us to know, there's a price increase. We have to take into account the considerations that surround the business. And I guess it's premature really to talk about that. Assuming that, and as we do expect that the .com contract will receive consent from the Commerce Department for the renewal and be effective no later than November 30, then the first opportunity to do so would be in December. So I think we probably be in a better position to talk to you about that then, what the factors, the economic factors, the climate would be and give you some more information then, but I think it's premature at this point.","Operator","And we'll now take a question from Dan Cummins from ThinkEquity.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Question for Jim on your strategy around the Managed Security Services. How is that going? Are you pleased with the progress? And does your higher year-end profit projection reflect any change in your investment posture around some growth initiatives?","D. James Bidzos","Okay. I assume when you said MSS, you meant NIA or am I...","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Yes, exactly, the NIA. Exactly.","D. James Bidzos","Okay, okay. Yes, we are still achieving bookings growth as we've planned for that business. I did mention in the last couple of calls and I mentioned again in this call that we are working to scale that business better for the quality of revenue that's more consistent with what we get from our Naming business. And I also mentioned in this call, which I've not mentioned before, that we are looking at ways that we can align expense with revenues. So I think those are some -- we don't break it out separately, of course, but I think that should give you a feel for where we're going with that business.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","And does it still figure somewhat in your M&A strategy or potential M&A strategy? I know you said before it's a market you like very much and you've mentioned before the problems associated with finding quality revenue.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, I would say our M&A policy is unchanged and whether it applies to that or any other part of our business, it's the same. We would certainly look at opportunities, if they helped us get on our product roadmap or our strategy faster. We do not have M&A on our radar. That is not part of our strategy. We don't view M&A as a strategy. I think what you should expect from us is if there was a small tuck-in opportunity, we'd look at it, if it helps us accelerate our strategy, but that would be the only reason.","Operator","We'll now go to Rob Owens from Pacific Crest.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","On the revenue reclass, the $1.8 million, was that a cumulative number that you just effectively took in this period or was that something that was an error relative to this period?","George E. Kilguss","Rob, yes, that was a cumulative, I'll call it, error that we accounted for in this period. So approximately -- of the $1.8 million, approximately $1 million is related to 2011 and the balance was related to first quarter of 2012.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And I apologize if I missed this, but what was the net new names guidance for Q3? Was that given earlier on the call?","D. James Bidzos","Yes it was. It was 1.6 million to 1.9 million.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and sorry about that. We're managing multiple calls. And then lastly, what are names up for renewal in Q3? Do you have that metric in front of you?","D. James Bidzos","Let's see if we can find that. John do you  have that?","George E. Kilguss","This is George. I think it's 23.7 million names that are renewing in the third quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now  take a question from Gray Powell from Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just had a couple of quick questions. So I guess longer term, assuming that the .com renewal goes according to plan, once you have that visibility on the next 6 years of revenue, how should we think about your comfort with leverage and potentially increasing your leverage target?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Gray, this is George. So I would start by saying that, look, I've been in the chair for about 2 months, so we'll continue to take a look and evaluate our capital structure, and this will be something we'll be spending some more time on over the next few quarters. But I can give you maybe a few thoughts that I have developed over the past 2 months. On the leverage side, and being a former lender earlier in my career, I tend to look at the total debt obligations outstanding the company has compared to its EBITDA as a measure of leverage. And when I look at VeriSign, we have, as you know, a $1.25 billion convertible bond plus about $200 million revolving credit facility, so somewhere between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion of total outstanding debt and commitments today. If you were to simply annualize our second quarter EBITDA and then compare that to the debt level that we have, you probably get a ratio of somewhere between 2.6 or 2.8x. And so the real question we need to answer, as a firm, over the coming quarters is, what is the appropriate leverage ratio for the business. We clearly have some debt capacity, but it's really all a matter of what is the appropriate risk profile for the business. So we'll have to do some more work to do on that, but that's really the current framework that I'm thinking about the debt that we have on the books and some thoughts around our capital structure.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it, that's very helpful. And then just one other question, if I can. What kind of investments should we expect you to incur to support the new gTLDs that you recently won? And should we think about that showing up as -- or I guess when should we think about that showing up as incremental CapEx or OpEx?","George E. Kilguss","Well, clearly, we'll have some incremental cost in bringing those on. I think what we really have to do is to wait for ICANN to go through their process and their approval process, then we'll have a definitive idea of who's been awarded what names. But clearly, we will have some incremental expense to do that. But again, that probably won't affect too much of 2013. But we'll probably give you more information and guidance to that on our fourth quarter call as we give guidance for 2013.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, I would just add to that, that we talked last quarter about the numbers. The number was 220 brands that had signed on to have VeriSign run their back-end registry services, and that number was the result of a process as Pat mentioned in the call last quarter. And I think, as I have mentioned as well, we actually did not take all the business that was available to us there. We do have the benefit of a long history of operating experience, a long reliability record and plus the fact that we just don't run common net, we run under other domains as well. We run .tv and .name and we have a structure that lends itself to supporting this type of multiple domain structure. So I think we're very carefully prepared and positioned and more experienced than -- I think we have a pretty good view into this, so I think George's comments were accurate. And that first of all, we have to wait and see which applications actually get through and what the actual number is. But there was a lot of thought and a lot of process and a lot of careful consideration given to arriving at the 220 number. And so we feel comfortable that we're prepared and our structure is predesigned to support multiple domains. So I think we're in good shape.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the new gTLDs, curious if there's any update on the process just over the past 4 to 5 weeks from your vantage point? And then also if you have any thoughts as to when you think we could potentially go live?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I'll let Pat comment. I'll just say that we're currently at a point where now the application period is where the reveal is made and everybody sees the strings that are applied for. ICANN is now undertaking its evaluation of all of those applications. But at some point, there will be a process that yield to the ultimate results. And maybe for a little more color, I'll ask Pat to comment.","Patrick S. Kane","And so I think the one thing to keep in mind is that during the evaluation process, there's a lot of things will take place in terms of what ICANN does, what the government advisory committee does and we believe that there'll be additions to the root zone come Q2 of 2013 in terms of things that will be meaningful. It's at the top of the list.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then we saw -- on another note, we saw the world IPv6 launch take place last month. Is there a point at which IPv6 could become a meaningful resonant opportunity for VeriSign? How do you think about that?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I don't know if I can tell you what that point is, but I think that gradually over time, helping our customers transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is certainly an opportunity for us and we are examining, as part of our innovation efforts, the opportunities that we have to add value to that transition process mainly around better security optimization. So we do see that as an opportunity, but I think it's too early to talk about when or exactly what it is.","Operator","We'll now go to Ed Maguire from CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I just had a question about the inputs into the capital efficiency. Since you've raised your margin expectations and lowered capital expense guidance for the year, what's behind this? It looks like you're getting greater, greater efficiencies out of your current infrastructure?","George E. Kilguss","I don't think there's anything material behind it, Ed. We continue to be good stewards of the business. We're looking for ways to be more efficient in the business and drive increased profitability. I just think it's continuing being prudent of looking at projects, evaluating them and making sure that we're doing the best job for the shareholders as we can.","D. James Bidzos","I would add to that, that the 4 points of our strategy, protect, grow, innovate and manage, they are there for a reason. We focus on them and in manage, we try to manage the business efficiently. So there is this longer tail of the restructuring that we undertook 5 years ago. I know it's been quite a while since 2007 when we began the divestiture, but it was -- even though it was completed in 2010, there are many opportunities for us to optimize and to do our business more efficiently. When you go from greater than 5,000 employees to roughly 1,000, you don't fix everything overnight. So we're finding efficiencies, and I think that's reflected in our increasing margins.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And I did want to follow up, you've made the comment about 220 registry agreements that you signed with the applicants. I'm just wondering if there's a possibility that might change or there are any of the contracts still up for potential bid and it sounds like you've also got a pretty high quality filter in terms of the agreements that you're seeking to go after, so any color there would be helpful.","Patrick S. Kane","Edward, this is Pat. So they're still talking about all the approval process, so that's 220 that we submitted at the end of the application window. So basically, there's no more applications that will be taken by ICANN at this point in time. But we know that we've got other unique services that we can provide to the registry operator, so it doesn't mean that the 220 we have today are the ultimate end set of what we do. But that being said, ICANN still has to approve all of these deals. They still sort of could -- it could go down.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll now go to Jaimin Soni from Bank of America.","Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to go to back to margins quickly. Can you just, if you can, please tell us if the margins that -- are they tracking to your internal plan or are you beating those targets that you have internally? And then going forward, I was just wondering if there's anything that you think is stopping you from really taking this outside that you're getting in margins and investing it in other businesses like the NIA business? Is there some limitation on the scale or demand or some type of technological limitations? What now do you think is the barrier for further investments into other adjacent businesses that can potentially drive top line growth?","D. James Bidzos","John, it's Jim. Let me refer you back to this 4 pillar sort of strategy for managing the business. So protect, grow, innovate and manage. So you're referring to the part we think of as managing the business efficiently, which is where margin expansion will occur. The answer to your question is that we don't really think about it as any single or some number of barriers to increasing margins. We think of it as a balance across those 4 areas. Job one is to protect the business. We have growth areas we've committed investments in. That's all baked into our guidance on margins. We think that we have intellectual capital and intellectual property that we can exploit in innovation, which doesn't require great investment, no great capital vestment. And so what you get through that process of balance is the guidance that we gave you in margins. So I think what you're seeing is sort of a steady growth in margins based on, essentially, a thoughtful balance across those 4 areas of our resources. So I really don't think of it as a single barrier. George, do want to comment further?","George E. Kilguss","I would just say that the company's also commented in previous calls on the long tail of the restructuring. And you can never know until you actually go through the quarter as to what other efficiencies you may obtain. So clearly, obviously, we have guided 52% to 54%, and now we've increased that guidance to 55%. So we're just seeing those efficiencies come out of the business as we manage it on a day-to-day basis.","D. James Bidzos",".","And again, I think that the fact that manage is 1\/4 of the -- 1 of the 4 pillars of our strategy, I think, is just our way of saying to you that we pay close attention to that. We're actively looking for opportunities and that long tail of the restructuring not exclusively to save money but to optimize and be more efficient to serve our customers better, and it's working.","Operator","And the last question of the day will come from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Listen, on the -- where we started with the discussion in terms of the search engine changes, so when Google adapted the AdSense program, which I think was in the summer of 2008, a lot of the discussion that we had was how much of the base of names is actually advertising or pay-per-click driven. Since these are first time renewals and they're trying to drive traffic to those types of pages, is there a similar type of analysis that you've done so we can get a sense as to maybe what portion of the base are first time renewals and what portion of those might be these types of advertising names that could get impacted?","D. James Bidzos","We haven't talked about any specific numbers, I think, actually, Sterling, since 2008. Back then, we did talk about what we believe to be the advertising makeup of the base. My sense of it is now without any specific data to give you at this moment is, first of all, the basis of those element is obviously much larger. I guess would be that the advertising names are probably larger than they were at the time. However, if you look at the renewal rate, at 72.9 over the last 2 quarters, just looking back, I'm sorry, in the 2 periods of 2010 and 2011, the Q2 periods, it differs only by -- and we did not have, by the way, any search engine changes in those periods. You're only talking about, respectively, 0.2 percentage point and 0.3 percentage point difference in the renewal rate. So my sense is that the safety in numbers, periods at work here and that the zone is larger and even though the number of advertising names may be larger, this rather rare change in search engine algorithms, 2008, now 2012, actually had a smaller impact than it did back then. I'm sure you're remember in 2008, the impact was quite significant. Here we are with a larger zone and a larger number of advertising names and yet the impact was rather modest, literally 0.2% compared to the same period a year ago or 0.3% 2010 and 2011. So that's the way we tend to think of it. The impact was very, very modest. I don't know if you want to add anything, Pat?","Patrick S. Kane","Nothing.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And last question and I'll let you go, is there a sense of whether there's going to be a pickup in registrar marketing and promotional campaigns here in the September quarter that might help offset some of the falloff that you just saw this quarter?","Patrick S. Kane","This is Pat. I think the registrars -- we've got insight at some of their plans, but not all of their plans, of course. I think that they run promotions from time to time and on a regular basis in terms of what's going on and just the kind of clients that they're trying to attract. So I think that you'll see that, yes.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today, and I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for a final comment.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator.

There, you will also find our third quarter 2017 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.","We reported revenue of $292 million, up 1.7% year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1 and $153 million in free cash flow.","During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.5 million shares for $147 million. Our financial position is strong, with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 145.8 million, consisting of 130.8 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.47 million net names during the third quarter after processing 8.9 million new gross registrations. Gross additions during the quarter benefited from continued strength from US based registrars.","Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2017 will be 74.3%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2016.","We expected increase to the domain name base during the fourth quarter of between 0.4 million to 0.9 million registrations, which is consistent with the full year 2017 domain name base growth rate of 2.8% to 3.1%.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George Kilguss","Thank you, Jim. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $292 million, up 1.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 41% was from foreign customers.","As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the third quarter totaled $181 million, compared with $175 million in the third quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 61.9% compared to 60.8% in the same quarter a year ago.","Net income totaled $115 million compared to $114 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.93 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.90 for the third quarter last year.","As of September 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $757 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.","I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance.","As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $14 million in stock-based compensation totaled $97 million, as compared to $100 million both last quarter and the same quarter a year ago.","While non-GAAP operating expenses were lower in the second quarter, we do expect an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 66.7% compared to 65.3% in the same quarter of 2016.","Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $124 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.1 million shares. This compares to $0.93 in the third quarter of 2016 and $1.05 last quarter, based on 127.7 million and 124.0 million weighted average diluted shares respectively.","Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $175 million and free cash flow was $153 million, compared with $171 million and $165 million respectively for the third quarter last year. Free cash flow in the third quarter was lower, partially due to a timing some capital expenditures.","Dilution related to convertible debentures was 24 million shares, based on average share price during the third quarter, compared with 20.8 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 22.5 million shares last quarter.","The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.5 million shares repurchased during the third quarter.","With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.161 billion to $1.166 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.155 billion to $1.165 billion range provided on our prior earnings call.","Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 65% and 65.5% increased and now from the 64.5% to 65.25% range provided on our prior earnings call.","Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million.","Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $45 million and $55 million, changed from the $40 million to $50 million range provided on the last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures.","As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue.","In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2017.","Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Bidzos","Thank you, George. In closing, during the third quarter we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders.

But beyond that there's nothing new to say at this point. Of course, as soon as there is we'll let you know.","Matt Lemenager","Got it. And my next question is just, do you have any thought on - I think about speculators or squatters, as we think about the arising with things like bitcoin and the theorem and things like that. Is there any - have you guys seen the impact of people who maybe before would have been coming and buying domain. Just curious to get your thoughts on kind of the impact of bitcoin and other things like that that people may be out purchasing?","James Bidzos","I don't know of any direct relationship between people purchasing bitcoin and domain names. I can tell you that we do - we do report on trends in domain name registration and bitcoin trends frequently, consistently and often. So people are registering names related to bitcoin and cryptocurrency and those types of things. So we do see those, and we do report those registration trends. Beyond that, I don't think there's any unusual activity that we have to report.","Matt Lemenager","Got it. Thanks, guys. I'll jump back in queue.","James Bidzos","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year, and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.07, up 11% year-over-year.","During the first quarter, we completed the repatriation of a net $1.15 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries which we intend to use in conjunction with the redemption of our convertible debentures, as George will discuss later. Also, we paused our repurchase activities during the 30-day conversion measurement period for our pending May 1 convertible bond redemption. As a result, we returned $125 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares in the first quarter.","Our financial position remained strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business, and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 148.3 million, consisting of 133.9 million names for .com and 14.4 million names for .net.","During the first quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.91 million names.

I also want to report that we are engaged in a dialogue with NTIA concerning the cooperative agreement which is ongoing, but beyond that we don't have more to say at this time.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from foreign customers.","As it relates to first quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $185 million compared with $175 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 62% compared to 60.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $134 million compared to $116 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.09 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.94 for the first quarter last year.","As of March 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $1.8 billion were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which will include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss the redemption of our convertible debentures and provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance.","As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 66.3% compared to 65.1% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $132 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.5 million shares, this compares to $0.96 in both the first quarter of 2017 and last quarter.","As noted in our last call, as a result of the Tax Act and beginning with this quarter's results, the tax rate used to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $90 million and free cash flow was $82 million compared with $148 million and $139 million respectively for the first quarter last year. First quarter 2018 cash flow reflects approximately $61 million in withholding taxes paid in connection with the net $1.15 billion repatriation.","As mentioned last quarter, in light of the Tax Act, we were evaluating our capital structure, including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures. You may have seen that on February 15, the company issued a redemption notice for all the outstanding convertible debentures. This redemption settles next week on May 1, and the company has sufficient domestic liquidity to settle the redemption. If holders elect to convert their debentures, the company intends to settle the $1.25 billion principal value in cash, and the excess value will be settled in shares of the company's stock.","The actual number of shares issued for holders who elect to convert is determined based on an observation period that ran from March 15, 2018, through today. While the calculation is not yet finalized, approximately 26.1 million shares would be issued if all convertible debenture holders elect to convert. For a comparison, 25.6 million shares of dilution related to the convertible debentures was used in calculating our fully diluted shares in our first quarter results, which was based on the average share price during the first quarter. The accounting for the settlement of the debentures will occur during the second quarter.","Historically, the convertible debentures were an important part of the company's capital structure. With U.S. tax reform implemented at the end of last year, many of the tax benefits generated by the convertible debentures were limited. Over time, this instrument became more equity-like in the company's capital structure, and with the diminished tax benefits post-tax reform, we decided to redeem the convertible debentures.","Now, I'd like to provide you some updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.215 billion now from the $1.195 billion to $1.215 billion provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $85 million and $92 million, decreased from the $115 million and $122 million range provided on our last call. The $30 million decrease in the range is primarily due to the redemption of our convertible notes.","Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $75 million to $95 million, change from the $70 million to $90 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, George. Overall, this has been another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues. We generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders.

And we will take our first question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to start with Jim, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a discussion now going on with the NTIA regarding the cooperative agreement. Just want to make sure we level set. So, does that mean that between now and November 30, this should come to a conclusion in terms of whether they extend the cooperative agreement or let it sunset? And is there any chance that we could see an announcement prior to that November 30th date?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Let's see. Well, first of all, you're correct that NTIA may decide to extend the cooperative agreement as is or let it sunset. Additionally, VeriSign and NTIA could mutually agree to amend it per the terms of Amendment 34 of the cooperative agreement. As far as what you might see between now and then, I think this early \u2013 I mean, we're engaged, but I think it's too early to say what milestones, when and what they would look like. It's just really too early to say anything more than we did unfortunately.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just a follow-up to that. When the announcement came that they would look at the cooperative agreement before November \u2013 or at the November 30th timeline, I think there were some discussion of a public interest study, has that come up in your discussions or is there anything that's been made public around that part in the process?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. As I said, it's just \u2013 we're engaged. I don't think it'd be appropriate for me to say anything about what's come up in the discussions that we're having, but they're are ongoing. And all I can tell you is that we'll certainly keep you posted, and if there are any milestones or anything to report, we'll do it promptly.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Sounds good. And then one question on the business, looking at the domestic\/international split, we went through that timeframe with the Chinese names. But I'm really curious, when you look at the international sourced growth in particular, what are you seeing in terms of where the areas of biggest growth at the moment and how do you think about the sustainability of it?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Sterling, this is George. I mean, when we talk about growth, we do think the drivers of domain name growth continue to be internet adoption, internet penetration, and continued growth of e-commerce. So, we think that those worldwide metrics bode well for our business. Where growth comes from quarter to quarter does vary. This quarter, in the first quarter, we saw good growth out of the U.S., out of China, and continued results out of our European registrars, registrars in all those areas seem to be performing well for us.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Matthew Wells with Citi. Please go ahead.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Jim. This is Matt with Citi. I wanted to ask if you had any update on .web?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Nothing. Nothing since we last spoke. And for those who weren't here or aren't familiar with what the status is, we're engaged in ICANN's process to move the delegation forward for .web. That's ICANN's process, so we can't say when it'll conclude. Just as a reminder too for all of you looking at the guidance of course, while it's possible that our operation of .web will start this year, we did not include, the 2018 revenue guidance provided does not include any revenue from .web, and we'll give you more updates as available, but unfortunately that's all I can give you now.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks on that. And I have one more question. Has .web and that purchase come up with your discussions with the NTIA at all?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","No. Our discussions with NTIA are about the cooperative agreement, .web we view separately. And the Department of Justice, of course, closed its open investigation of .web. So, it has not come up. We wouldn't expect it to.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Yes. That's helpful.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon. Thanks. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob. I've a question on the renewal rate, 74.9% this quarter is a bit higher than it's been trending. And I know we're kind of churning through the China names and things like that, and the renewal rate might be expected to go up. But was there anything that drove the 74.9% renewal rate? Because that ticked up from the highest metric at least in recent years.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. Matt, thanks. As you point out, our preliminary renewal rate of 74.9% was a good renewal rate for us, but I think as you also alluded to, when you compare that to our Q1 2017 renewal rate of 72.5%, the change there is really primarily related to a depressed Q1 2017 rate that was negatively impacted by the China surge names that were registered in the first quarter of 2016 that did not renew in the first quarter of 2017.","And while 2017 was still up year-over-year when I exclude those impacts from 2017, it is still really consistent with our normal expectations of a slightly rising renewal rate associated with an aging domain name base. So, I don't think there's anything unusual to call out there, other than the base continues to age, and as a result, renewal rates tend to pick up a slight amount as the previous renewed names become a large proportion of the overall base.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And just given the cash repatriation, just a question I guess on capital allocation, capital structure, and then we paused the buyback this quarter a little bit. Are there any plans to step up the buyback going forward just given the new allocation structure?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Matt, as in the past, we don't guide to buybacks. We have an active capital allocation process that we look at every quarter, and we try to meet the needs of the business every quarter, and we determine through our strategic framework, protect, grow and manage how much liquidity we need to have for the business, what do we need to invest in the business, what do we need to, and then what we have to return to shareholders. So, we look at that every quarter and make a determination, but we do not provide guidance with regard to buybacks.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question will be a follow-up question from Matthew Wells with Citi. Please go ahead.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, Jim. This question is along the same thread that was just asked. But when you're looking at your framework for capital allocation, does the redemption of the debt and changes to the tax law change, how you look at repurchases versus potentially issuing a dividend?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Go ahead, George.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. I would say, look, whether it was post-tax reform or post-redemption of our convertible debenture, I really don't expect our capital structure or capital allocation philosophy to change. Again, we constantly review the needs of the business and we're really trying to make decisions that are in the best interest of the business. So, we clearly look at the best way to return that capital to shareholders. Historically, we felt that the share repurchases have been in the best interest of the shareholders.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we're not quite complete yet with the redemption of the bond. That process will be complete soon. We did make a repatriation of the $1.15 billion, and obviously, that will look different going forward. I think we're still really evaluating all the long-term significance of the tax law. I think the one thing I can assure you of is that, our priority of course is protect, grow and manage. And in the manage category, when it comes to making sure that we return generated value to shareholders, we're going to do that in the most efficient way possible.","The philosophy that drives that hasn't changed a bit. I think you're asking a more tactical question as to whether or not some rethinking would lead to some analysis that says a dividend or some shift in or difference or reallocation of buybacks to dividends. And we don't guide to that as George said, but I think that's sort of a tactical question that our ongoing analysis would yield, and if something there changes, we would certainly share it when appropriate.","But fundamentally, nothing has really changed. We're just looking at a very dynamic situation, where the tax law gives us opportunities, and we're still assessing them and looking for what's in the best long-term interest of our shareholders in terms of capital structure and capital allocation relative to our strategy of efficiently returning generated value, that hasn't changed a bit.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That color was really helpful. Appreciate your time.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments.","David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, operator.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The fourth quarter capped a solid 2012 for VeriSign. We delivered for the global community of Internet users that increasingly rely on us by marking 15 years of uninterrupted availability for .com and .net. We renewed the .com agreement for another 6 years, reported 2012 revenue of $874 million which was 13% revenue year-over-year growth and delivered strong financial performance including $503 million in free cash flow. We continue to see benefits from our restructuring, focus and discipline.","In Naming we processed a record 33.1 million new gross registrations during 2012, finishing the year with 121.1 million names on the domain name base. Our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. With the clarity of the .com renewal now behind us, we can now focus more of our attention on other strategic initiatives.","In 2013, we intend to put greater emphasis on developing new revenue streams as we explore new products, services and innovation to enhance our offerings. The certainty of the renewal also allows us to focus on our longer-term financial plan, including a review of our capital structure and putting more emphasis on finding efficiencies in our business.","Before I get into the fourth quarter results, I want to highlight a few events from the quarter. On November 30, 2012, we announced the approval of the renewal of the revised .com agreement by the U.S. Department of Commerce for the term beginning on December 1, 2012, and running through November 30, 2018, and the modified terms of the revised agreement.","This approval is an endorsement of our record on security and stability and our offerings of .com registry services on reasonable prices, terms and conditions. The price of a .com registration is now fixed at $7.85 and as of the fourth quarter 2012 end we have 106.2 million .com names in our domain name base.","On December 19, we announced an increase in registry domain name fees for .net per our agreement with ICANN. As of July 1, 2013 the registry fee for .net domain names will increase from $5.11 to $5.62. Also by way of update, in December, ICANN completed its prioritization draw for processing applications related to its new gTLD program.","As expected, ICANN gave priority to internationalized domain name transliterations. As you may recall, 12 of our 14 applications were for IDN versions of .com and .net. Based on ICANN's current time line, we are not likely to see revenue from this opportunity until 2014.","Finally, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.3 million shares for $94 million. Through 2012, we repurchased approximately 7.7 million shares for $315 million. On December 5, 2012, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by approximately $459 million to a total of $1 billion for VeriSign common stock. As of December 31, 2012, we have approximately $976 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. In our naming business at the end of December, the base of registered names in .com equaled 106.2 million names while .net equaled 14.9 million names. The total base of registered names in .com and .net was 121.1 million at the end of December. This represents an increase of 6.4% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter.","In the fourth quarter, we added 1.25 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8 million new gross registrations during the fourth quarter, up 1% compared with the same period a year ago. For the full year 2012, we processed a record 33.1 million new gross registrations, up 3% from full year 2011. In the third quarter of 2012, the overall renewal rate was 72.5%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.9%. This rate compares to 73.5% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011.","We see the continuing effects of changes in search out rhythms and macroeconomic headwinds we discussed during last quarter earnings call in our net additions. Search engine adjustments made over the past several months have affected the economics which drive domain monetization. As noted in prior earnings calls, we have seen these search engine changes in the past which have impacted our first time renewing names and our overall renewal rates. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted to such changes over several quarters but we have no way of knowing how long they will be impacted by the changes being made in the current environment but we are now experiencing the third quarter of these effects. Secondly, we continue to see signs suggesting that macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, have led to softer international renewal rates. However, while these factors are still present, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization and improvement in the renewal rate.","Taking into consideration these and other factors, we expect the first quarter net names for .com and .net added to the base to between 2.0 million and 2.4 million names. As discussed on prior calls, we post updates to the zone on our website at least once per day. With this continued transparency, you're able to track how the zone is growing throughout the first quarter.","Our NIA business continues to exhibit good year-over-year revenue for both. Our efforts remain focused on positioning the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Kilguss.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During 2012, we generated revenue of $874 million and delivered non-GAAP operating income of $491 million, all while expanding non-GAAP operating margins to 56.2%. These results drove approximately $503 million in free cash flow for the year. As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of December 31, 2012, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2.1 billion of which $1.6 billion was in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Of the $1.6 billion, approximately $280 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.","Total liabilities were $2.1 billion as of the fourth quarter, up from $1.9 billion a year ago. Due to the stock price not exceeding the convertible debenture trigger of $44.68 in 20 of the last 30 trading days during the fourth quarter, our convertible debentures were no longer convertible starting January 1, 2013. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures, the related embedded derivative and the deferred tax liability were reclassified from current liabilities back to long-term liabilities while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from current assets back to long-term assets as of the third -- December 31, 2012.","Total debt on the balance sheet was $698 million at quarter end consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under our $200 million revolving credit facility and the $598 million present value of the $1.25 billion in convertible debentures. The convertible debentures will continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet up to its $1.25 billion par value over its 25-year remaining term.","As mentioned in prior calls, we are in the process of reviewing the company's capital structure. As we review our capital structure, we are looking at both the leverage profile, including our domestic borrowing capacity, as well as our international cash balance and how that cash balance inter-relates with our international tax structure. We expect to have more information to share with you related to our thoughts around the company's capital structure during our Q1 earnings call in April.","Deferred revenue at the end of the year totaled $813 million, an $84 million increase from year-end 2011. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2012 the company generated revenues of $230 million, up 13% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. During the quarter, the company delivered GAAP operating income of $135 million, up 46% from $93 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 58.8% compared to 45.6% in the comparable quarter a year ago, which was as a result of both top line growth and stable costs during the quarter. GAAP net income totaled $106 million compared to $54 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.34 for the fourth quarter in 2011.","Results for the fourth quarter of 2012 included nonrecurring, pretax benefits of $13.6 million, split $5.8 million and $7.8 million between continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively. These amounts were primarily related to reimbursements of previously incurred litigation and defense costs received upon settlement with the selling shareholders of a previously acquired business. Additionally, fourth quarter 2012 results include pretax benefits of $5.5 million related to a reduction in our estimated bonus payout for fiscal 2012. Together these items increased the GAAP operating margin by 4.9% and diluted earnings per share by $0.07.","I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter and full year operating metrics which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2013 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $230 million for the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States, and 40% was from foreign customers.","Revenue in the fourth quarter from international sources grew 14.5% year-over-year and slightly faster than our domestic-sourced revenue, which grew 12.1% year-over-year. 2012 full year revenue was $874 million, up 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2012 included nonrecurring pretax benefits of $5.8 million recorded in continuing operations primarily related to the reimbursement of the previously incurred litigation defense costs received upon settlement with selling shareholders of that previously acquired business.","Additionally, the non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2012 also included the pretax benefit of $5.5 million related to the reduction in our estimated bonus payout. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $7 million in stock-based compensation, totaled $87 million and was down 11% sequentially as a result of the abovementioned $11.3 million in Q4 benefits.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter expanded to 62% compared to 56.4% in the third quarter of 2012. The nonrecurring pretax benefits and estimated bonus accruals adjustment previously discussed also increased non-GAAP operating margin by 4.9%. After adjusting for these credits and accrual adjustments, our fourth quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to obtain operational efficiencies to help offset rising costs, which allowed us to keep total expenses in line with the previous quarter.","Our non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $96 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.59 compared to $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $0.50 last quarter. The estimated bonus accrual adjustment and credits previously mentioned increased fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.05. Full year 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.97, a 32% increase over fiscal 2011. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP operating income net for fiscal 2012 was $38 million.","With respect to taxes, as we've previously stated, starting from the third quarter of 2012, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and our non-GAAP EPS calculations. We continue to use the 30% non-GAAP tax rate for prior periods presented. In 2013, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $40 million to $50 million.","We had a weighted average diluted share count of 162 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 166.6 million shares in the third quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 6.4 million shares based on the average share pricing during the quarter, a decrease of 2.8 million shares from the third quarter. Share count was decreased further by the full impact of Q3 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 2.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.","Operating cash flow was $171 million for the fourth quarter up from $122 million in the third quarter of 2012 and up compared to $124 million for the same quarter last year. Full-year operating 2012 cash flow was $538 million compared with $336 million for 2011. Free cash flow was $155 million for the fourth quarter of 2012 and includes a decrease of $2.3 million in excess benefits from stock-based compensation and excludes $13 million in capital expenditures in the quarter. Free cash flow for 2012 was $503 million, including $18 million in excess tax benefits and excluding $53 million in capital expenditures.","With respect to 2013 guidance, revenue for 2013 should be in the range of $945 million to $960 million, representing an annual growth rate of 8% to 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full-year 2013 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be at least 57%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP, non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $40 million and $42 million for 2013, and capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $60 million and $80 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business and increased operating efficiencies in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, we continue to demonstrate sound performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2012. We have grown our non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. Before opening the call to your questions, I would like to use our strategic framework and its 4 areas of focus to frame how we think about the business. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business. First, protect. We will continue to protect the business by meeting all of our obligations under our ICANN agreements to operate top level domains.","Second, grow. We will continue to see growth in the following ways: expansion of our existing businesses through focused marketing programs that target com\/net zone growth, particularly in emerging international markets, by extending our brand and serving new markets through the IDNs for which we have applied; by extending our high reliability platform to underpin new brand and generic TLDs, including our approximately 220 new gTLD customers; by continuing to scale and grow our NIA business; and by leveraging our patent portfolio to both generate revenue and support our business strategy.","Third, innovate. As evidenced by our continued filing of patent applications, we are focused on innovation. The goal is new revenue streams resulting from innovative new services that leverage our strengths.","And fourth, manage. We will continue to manage the business responsibly from a financial perspective. As mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of the .com contract renewal is certainty which allows us greater flexibility in optimizing debt, capital allocation and capital structure. We will have more to say on this subject during our next earnings call. We believe that continuing to deliver on these 4 areas with the right balance should best serve our customers, employees and shareholders.","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Obviously, you've been adjusting for the one-time items, very strong operating margin. The outlook you gave on the margin side was quite strong as well. Just wondering if you could walk through just sort of how you kind of view incremental operating margins from here, especially kind of with the context of the renewal having gone through and then you all focusing also on some new business areas and some new segments. Does that include incremental costs going forward? Where do you see the leverage coming from, et cetera?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Philip. This is George. With respect to incremental operating margins throughout fiscal 2012, really our incremental operating margin came from our revenue growth. If you look at our expenses, taking out some of those one-time items, we've been consistently around the $98 million, $99 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding stock-based compensation from an expense standpoint. And we\u2019ve -- as we've talked about, we've been able to invest in those areas, sales and marketing, R&D, while creating efficiencies in our operations. As we look out into 2013 we do have some increasing expenses. Like all companies, we have wage expense increases and health care benefits increasing. Unique to VeriSign, we also have costs associated increasing with our new contract with the com renewal where that's now a variable cost. And that, as I said before, will increase costs probably somewhere around $700,000 a month. So we absolutely have increased costs going forward in the business. What we -- what's included in our guidance is our desire, our objective to try to offset those costs to some degree with increased efficiencies. Again, as in 2012, the majority of our margin expansion will come from revenue growth.","D. James Bidzos","And Phil, this is Jim. Let me just add, too, I think you mentioned how we're looking at margins and expense given the growth initiatives that we have. Let me just add to what George said that the growth initiatives that I mentioned, so for example, expanding our existing businesses through focused marketing programs. That's baked into the budget and obviously baked into the forecast and the guidance that we gave. We have invested in marketing programs over the years. They are more focused going forward. We're targeting geographies where we think there's real growth opportunity for the com\/net zone. The IDNs, we have made -- we've already made the investment in the application fees, as you know, in early 2012. And the support that we'll be providing in terms of back-end registry services for the 220 customers that we signed up, we do have something of an advantage, having been a registry in operation for a long time and having supported multiple TLDs over all of those years of com, net, tv, cc, several others that VeriSign supports. So we've built something called Name Store. So basically, we have a tremendous amount of experience in standing up and operating multiple TLDs within our existing platform. So I think that gives us something of an advantage in that this is something we've invested in, we've built and we have operational and we know how to do. NIA, of course, is something we've been investing in for over 2 years now, and we're optimizing that business. And I talked about our patent portfolio and that's something new. We've never really exploited it before. But essentially, the investments in those areas -- the substantial investments have been made. And I think we've been consistently clear, but let me do it again, about mergers and acquisitions. We don't believe that M&A is a strategy. We don't see any M&A on our horizon. If an opportunity presented itself that helped us accelerate our business strategy, certainly we'd look at that. But that's not part of our plan. So I hope that bit of color gives you a little more insight into how to think about expenses, margins, and growth opportunities through 2013.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just had a couple. So could you maybe help me clarify something in terms of the timing of new gTLDs? Because it looks like ICANN will be approving your foreign language .com transliterations a little bit earlier, at least than what we'd expected. From the website, it looks like possibly early June. So I guess, is that correct? And if so, when do you expect to actually go live? And then, just lastly, how should we think about pricing on the foreign language transliterations?","D. James Bidzos","Pat, do you want to comment?","Patrick S. Kane","Sure. So as far as the timing goes, the way that the -- this is Pat, the way that -- the way ICANN has laid out the process, it is mechanically possible for new gTLDs to go sometime in Q3. But there's still many outstanding items to be completed, and so I think it's more towards the end of the year. And just recently, Steve Crocker, the Chairman of the Board for ICANN, has indicated that it would be more towards the end of the year. So while it's possible, I think it's going to be, like I said, towards the end of the year. So that is -- and then as far as pricing goes, it's not really -- it doesn't have the same boundaries as the .com contract does, so we can basically set the pricing, and we're still evaluating what that pricing looks like.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, just for clarity, the .com contract is unique in that the cooperative agreement between the Department of Commerce and VeriSign exists for that TLD only. .net is only between VeriSign and ICANN. All of the new applications that we've made in ICANN's new gTLD program and the other domains that we operate are strictly based on contractual relationships between ICANN and VeriSign and are not subject to any price limitations, such as the ones that were imposed in the renewal by the Department of Commerce for .com. And as Pat said, we're still evaluating how we'll be pricing those IDNs. But just like every other applicant in the new gTLD program, we have complete flexibility in how we price them and whatever price increases we choose to bring in over time.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then one more, if I may. Just of the 220 new gTLDs that you will be supporting, can you give us a sense as to how many are brands versus geographies or communities of interest and I guess maybe any other classifications that I may have missed?","Patrick S. Kane","Yes, this is Pat. The majority of those 220 are brands or generics operated by brands, and so they will be used probably differently than you would see the major generics. And we have probably 8% to 10% that fall in the other range to include some generics, but the majority of them are brands.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'd just like to talk about the outlook for the zone file kind of in general and what kind of growth are you looking for in 2013 in the .net and .com zone file?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Steve. So as you know, we guided between 8% to 10% revenue growth for the year for 2013. Last year, we grew at 6.4% for the full year. As you also know, the components of the zone growth really are a function of the growth additions we experienced in the zone as well as the deletes coming out. And we've talked for a few quarters now about the deletes and the deletes we've been seeing overseas which results from the economy, and some of the deletes that have been impacted as a result of some of the changes to the Google algorithm. So part of our guidance, as we look into 2013, is clearly taking into consideration some of those trends with the deletes in the zone. And as we go through the year, we'll get some more visibility as we're right now 3 quarters into or beyond the time when Google made those material changes which impacted us. So today, to answer your question, our current view is the zone growth is somewhere between 4% and 6% that's baked into our full year guidance for 2013.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And is it possible that we could see the renewal rates start to improve in the second half of the year after we start to anniversary the algorithm change?","George E. Kilguss","So I think that's a possibility. I think the real answer is we don't know. What we've seen our preliminary renewal rate for the fourth quarter is that it seems to be upticking a little bit. It is back to the second quarter of 2012 rate or thereabouts. Still below 2011 but we are seeing some stabilization, some early signs of that. So it is a possibility, but I think it's just fairly too early to tell right now to where the renewal rate will trend for the full year of 2013.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, Steve. This is Jim. There's also a lot of moving parts to sort of calculating revenue growth and zone growth. In addition to what George said in terms of impact from the search engine, search algorithm changes which are just really hard to predict, we, at this point, have no visibility, no idea what sort of promotional programs registrars may bring into play during any one of the 4 quarters of 2013. Promotions tend to bring in a lot of names that then later on have impact in the subsequent year. So it's just hard to predict what that growth will be because there's just so many variables.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","George, I was wondering if you could talk to us about on the guidance sort of a cash flow number we should be thinking about for 2013. And then also related to that, how much of that cash do you expect to generate in the U.S.?","George E. Kilguss","Well, I think in general, when you look at our revenues, Walter, we've talked about 60% domestic and 40% international. And that math tends to flow through our income statement for the most part as it relates to cash. So I think that's a fair assessment. I guess from a cash flow perspective, we don't guide to a full year free cash flow number but I think if you take our non-GAAP operating margins, you take and consider the CapEx that we guided, I think you can get a pretty good idea from that math. But this year, we did $503 million. Clearly, incrementally, we expect that number to grow. And then I think you have enough data points to come to a conclusion there, but about 60% is domestic and 40% is international.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a question for Jim on the patents, are you -- I guess monetization of patents, you've talked about here now for a couple quarters. Is this something that you intend to monetize through IP or is there any products? Can you talk a bit about -- or sale of patents, could you talk a bit about more specifically about how you think you can monetize some of the patents that you have?","D. James Bidzos","I think it's a bit early to talk in detail about how we'll actually do that, but there are a number of different ways. Certainly, one of them that you mentioned, selling patents, that's probably the least likely to occur here. We have a broad patent portfolio. We have over 200 patents and applications in the U.S. alone. We have, to date, not asserted any of our patents. We're reviewing that policy. We have a large number of patents -- a portion of our patents read directly on registry operations, so we think that there are some things that are certainly worth looking at there. The 2 primary ways, one would be to license the patents and generate royalty revenue. Having been in a business before that -- where patents were a great asset, I can tell you from experience that a much more attractive way is to use the patents, if possible, to leverage a business strategy. So that would be the preferred method, but certainly behind that, royalty revenue would be another way to do it. And we are very active in our innovation program, and we're filing many new applications as well so this is a new area. Too early to say exactly how and what that will produce, but we're looking at it very closely and we think it's an opportunity for us.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Safe to say this is no part of your 2013 guidance or are you thinking that you may get some revenue in 2013?","D. James Bidzos","I think it's just really too early to say.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan Chase.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. I want to clarify or I want to make sure I heard correctly, George, you said the operating margin guidance is 57% at least for the full year?","George E. Kilguss","That's correct, at least 57% for the full year.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. Jim, when you talk about the tweaks to the search engine, were there further tweaks made in the fourth quarter and does that restart the clock of the 2- to 3-quarter adjustment? Or are we 3 quarters into people adapting to it and we should be in the smaller tail of the impacts?","D. James Bidzos","I don't know that we have enough detailed information about what changes were being made in that timeframe to say. First, I'll just say that there are changes being made to -- Google, for example, makes changes to their search algorithms essentially constantly. We noticed on, as you know, back in 2009 there were changes they made that directly affected the renewal of domain names and again a year ago. To what extent they either extended or renewed or intensified or changed in any way those efforts, we, at this point, can't say. We do know that over time, the people who use domain names for monetization purposes, advertising or other ways that they generate revenue from them, we do know that they typically tend to find ways to adjust and adapt. There is one thing we do know, that a domain monetization, entity or individual can currently look at their portfolio of names, and essentially I think they can expect a higher yield from it because their cost of goods, essentially the cost of acquiring domain names, has just been fixed at $7.85. So there's one data point that we can give you with some certainty based on the renewal of last November that does change the financials for the monetization of domain names. Their cost of goods is fixed. The portfolios that they hold should now basically have a higher yield. That may be [indiscernible].","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. Sorry, Jim. And just last question, you mentioned the new revenue sources for 2013, new products and services. While I don't expect you to tell us exactly what they are tonight, can you give us a sense of when we might -- timing wise, when we might hear more in terms of exactly what those things would be?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I hope it will be earlier in the year. Our plan is to share more information and possibly roll something out in 2013, but that's a -- those new products and services that play to our strengths that are very core are really the central focus of our innovation efforts. Those efforts tend to spin out a lot of the times that I talked about earlier. But I hope to be talking to you more about it in 2013, and I hope sooner rather than later in the year. But it's too early to say exactly when right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Rob Owens with Pacific Crest Securities.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Was curious on the network intelligence availability front, just if we look at those different services, are they material to revenue? Are there about 10% or more yet or at what point in the future do you think they'll reach that type of level?","D. James Bidzos","They're not at that point yet and we don't guide to those, so I can't really tell you exactly when that'll happen. I can tell you that our efforts to streamline that business, to improve the quality of revenue and to optimize the offerings are yielding some fruit. And as I mentioned, we are seeing increased revenue from that part of the business, so that much I can say. I think everybody knows, who reads the press, that our DDoS attacks are growing, so we see that as an opportunity. Our managed DNS customers certainly benefit from that service that we offer. We -- that part of the business is relatively new, of course, compared to the domain name business. So learning how to optimize it, improve the quality of revenue, more efficiently onboard customers, provision them better, more efficiently, these are all the kinds of things that we're constantly working on. But at this point, we're not reporting it separately, and I can't tell you when that might happen.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Could you elaborate a little bit on what you mean by improve the quality? Has it been a lumpy business? Have you seen a lot of customer churn there?","D. James Bidzos","What we've said in the past and is still true today is that initially, when we launched this business a couple of years ago, the primary focus was to see how it might grow and to pursue bookings. And what we're doing now is optimizing it. It's basically aligning revenue. We're focusing more on revenue rather than bookings and aligning revenue with expenses better and improving the quality of revenue, primarily translating into better margins.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then second, as I think about new name growth, you've had kind of a flat 6 months here in terms of new names, and you have a tough comp coming up year-over-year in Q1. Just how should we think about new name growth in 2013 and how that helps contribute to overall net new name growth?","George E. Kilguss","Well, again, as I mentioned, Rob, I mean, our guidance implies about a 4% to 6% zone growth, so that would be your net numbers. We gave you guidance for the first quarter of what we think our first quarter net addition would be in the 2 million to 2.4 million names. Excuse me, so clearly, that is below what we achieved in the prior year. And what you're seeing in some of that estimation is clearly some of the trends we're seeing, even though the renewal rate seems to be stabilizing and looks to be upticking between last quarter. Some of the cautiousness of the changes that we've seen in the international economy as well are factored into our guidance for 2013. Now we'll continue to monitor that. And as we get more information, we'll fully update the market on that. But those are the factors that are really baked into our 2013 guidance at the present.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, don't forget also, Rob, that we're currently at 121.1 million names in the com\/net zone. So as the zone gets bigger, you would expect that the rate of growth would start to basically decline a bit, the law of large numbers, et cetera, coming into effect. In answer to an earlier question as well, I might add, about the renewal rate in the second half of 2013, I believe was the question we had earlier, that the larger zone, the aging zone should theoretically at least yield higher renewal rates as the growth rate tends to slack off. Those are more of the moving parts, so it's just really hard to say. As the zone gets older and it gets larger, the growth dynamics of it change. And as George mentioned, the market's changing as well.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two more follow-ups. One, on the capital discussion that you're having specifically to repatriating cash, can you talk to us a little bit about what some of the hurdles or things that you have to consider in repatriating that cash beyond just paying the taxes to bring it back?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Sterling. I can give you some insight. I mean, we're still working that and we'll have more to say next quarter. But clearly, there's a couple things or factors that we need to consider. One is that cash that we have international, like most firms, is part of our international tax structure. And as a result, on the cash we generate overseas, we pay a much lower effective tax rate. So to the extent we were to evaluate any type of repatriation in addition to understanding the tax rate that you'd have to pay, we have to take into consideration how that may disrupt our international tax structure over there, with 40% of our business over there, and would that actually increase our effective tax rate on the monies earned over there if we were to change that tax structure. In addition, we'd also have to look at any other taxes that may -- may or may not incur as a result of taking that cash back with the international entity that we contracted with in setting up that structure. So there may be some other taxes, whether it be exit tax or some other type of tax that may be incurred if you were to make significant changes. And so we're looking at that tax structure. We're looking at our planning and our forecasting, where we're generating our revenues, and it's really those factors that could create potentially increased liability or forego some of the benefits that we've already put in place with the effective tax rate we have over there, which is a much lower effective tax rate to the United States.","D. James Bidzos","Yes. And Sterling, I would just -- it's Jim. I would just add to that, too. At least if you look backwards in the past, when opportunities have presented themselves, in the fourth quarter of 2011 for example, we had an opportunity with some previously taxed income to do a repatriation. When those opportunities have presented themselves, we've taken advantage of them. But I think it's complex. It's part of our international tax structure, as George said. And we're in the same boat as numerous other American companies with offshore cash essentially for the same reasons.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And one housekeeping question. Can you give us a sense of the total names up for renewal in the first quarter versus what it was in the first quarter of 2012?","D. James Bidzos","Yes. We can find that number here. That's $27.2 million.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what was it in\u2026","D. James Bidzos","Oh, sorry, the year-ago number?","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes.","D. James Bidzos","$25.2 million.","Operator","We want to take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim, I know you're not breaking out NIA, it's obviously too small a business at this point. But just looking back at 2012, how did your \u2013 qualitatively, how did your NIA business perform relative to your initial expectations?","D. James Bidzos","Well, if you mean by initial, expectations of roughly a year ago when we started streamlining it or optimizing it, or from 2 years ago?","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Exactly, from 1 year ago.","D. James Bidzos","From a year ago, I'd say it's performing in line with our expectations.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And any thoughts in terms of headcount for 2013 versus 2012? Are you expecting any change in either direction?","D. James Bidzos","Let's see. Our current headcount, I believe, is roughly\u2026","George E. Kilguss","Well, roughly 1,100.","D. James Bidzos","[indiscernible] something like that, yes.","George E. Kilguss","So we have some -- as always, we have in our budget some planned headcount in different departments but it doesn't appear, well, I can tell you, it's not material right now from our perspective. But clearly, as businesses have different needs and as they change, we absolutely add headcount in certain areas. To the extent we have those skill sets internally and we can adjust, we'll do that. But there are some times when we don't have the skill set in house and we have to go outside for that, so we do have some headcount budgeted to add in fiscal \u201813.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, George, on the cash flow statement, you had a pretty big benefit this quarter from accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Just wondering if you would provide some color as to why that was so strong in the December period.","George E. Kilguss","We can follow up on you that, but it has to do with our Synnex benefit. The share price declined, and as a result, we had a change in the embedded derivative related to our Synnex instrument as the stock price declined. But we can follow up on the specifics on that if you'd like.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Dan Cummins with B. Riley & Company.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","First question for George. In thinking about spending and in anticipation of kind of the back-end registry mandates. Can you give us a sense, if you took brand assignments on the one hand, presuming that those would be fixed priced arrangements because the volumes would not be significant, would spending for something like that be in the tens of thousands of dollars, perhaps, as opposed to something like a mandate like running.web, something that could actually scale? In that instance, do you anticipate that preparatory spending could be as much as $1 million or $2 million? Can you just kind of give us a sense of what to think about as these new generic TLDs go live, kind of your spending profile ahead of those? And then I have a follow-up.","D. James Bidzos","Okay, this is Jim. Let me just make a general comment about that, and then I'll let George or Pat weigh in. First of all, as I mentioned earlier, we have the infrastructure in place already to support multiple TLDs. So essentially, the larger investments to create the infrastructure and the framework, to operate multiple TLDs is something we already have in place. As far as the individual cost per TLD, whether it's a brand or whether it's a distributed TLD, I'm not sure that we can into that level of detail or even explain what it is or even if there is that much difference. I'll let Pat weigh in on what sort of provisioning there is there.","Patrick S. Kane","Yes, so it's a task. The mainframe platform, as Jim mentioned earlier, is really -- it's already set up and designed to onboard these new gTLDs. And then our resolution sites, we've got 74 or 75 around the globe that are positioned strategically that we can actually run traffic through. And as that traffic continues to grow, we'll scale those sites based upon the same decision process we take today.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","And just on hand -- do you know how many of those so-called distributed TLDs you have in hand right now of the 220?","Patrick S. Kane","It's between 8% and 10%.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. My other question was for George or for Jim. When George talked in very specific terms, I think it was on the July call, about the possibility of levering up the company, I think you were talking about your gross debt EBITDA being around 3, I think. You said that those decisions would be made very carefully in the context of your risk profile. And I apologize if this was asked on the November call, but I was kind of out of the loop. But do you feel like the company's risk profile has changed significantly as a result of what Congress has done or not?","George E. Kilguss","That's a good question. I think, clearly, with the certainty of the contract renewed I think -- excuse me, that from a timing perspective, clearly, that gives us certainty over the next 6 years. The risk of the company is a dynamic thing. We clearly have to position ourselves to protect the assets we have and to invest in growth. But I would say, in general, at the higher level, I don't think the risk profile has changed that dramatically year-over-year from before the renewal or after the renewal.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Craig Nankervis with First Analysis.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked, but I do have one. Just out of curiosity, can you talk at all about the linearity within a quarter of how names are renewed and how your progress towards the net new names may play out, especially in Q4? Is there a certain seasonality within the months of Q4 that is different than the other quarters? Or just is there any pattern that you've seen that you can just relate?","George E. Kilguss","Well, clearly, with regard to names or new additions there, there is seasonality. In the fourth quarter, we clearly see things trail off as you get close to the holidays. The last few weeks of December, everybody's on holiday and they go away. We have a similar phenomenon typically in the first quarter that surrounds the Chinese New Year where when that happens it slows down for a period of time. And we've also seen in previous quarters that revenue or -- I'm sorry, new units have grown dramatically in the first quarter as a lot of registrars have run promotions in the first quarter. So it varies from quarter-to-quarter. From a revenue perspective, however, you probably wouldn't see a lot of difference in seasonality as the majority of the revenue gets accreted into revenue as a result of our deferred revenue, and we're amortizing the bulk of that over the course of the year ratably.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Sure, sure. Yes, I understand the revenue side. I was just sort of curious about the actual renewals themselves and some of the patterns within the quarter, that's all.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Scott Kessler with Standard & Poor's.","Scott H. Kessler - S&P Equity Research","So obviously, there's been a lot of talk on this call and I guess the prior couple of calls perhaps, Jim, about patents. I think you talked about some of the areas where you have patents. I think you mentioned 200 patenting applications in the U.S. I'm wondering if you could somehow quantify both more recent activity related to patents. For example, I think I saw recently that you guys were awarded some sort of patent related to automated country code registrations in bulk. And I'm also wondering if, especially in light of the Department of Commerce and its involvement in the company, if you have concerns about the possibility that increased, let's say, monetization efforts around patents could potentially lead to some type of regulatory issue or concern.","D. James Bidzos","Well, let's see. First of all, we, in late 2011, we stepped up our innovation efforts. We funded a larger innovation effort. We increased our research activities. And that started to yield a step-up in patent applications. There was a step-up back in 2008 but a bigger step-up in innovation in general, in R&D in particular, in late 2011. So we've been quite active in the last year, and there have been a number of applications that have been submitted. So I think that's where we're getting that from. We have not, in the past, asserted any patents or really exploited our patent portfolio. In terms of how we would do that or would there be any issues associated with any regulatory aspect of doing that, I guess I certainly can't think of any. There are certainly regulated utilities and other regulated entities that have patents, that monetize patents. I can't imagine that would be an issue for us. We're certainly entitled to exploit our intellectual property and to seek revenue streams where we can find them. And we're certainly motivated to do that given the flat pricing that we'll have over the next 6 years. So I guess the short answer to your question is I don't believe that should be any issue at all for us. Intellectual property is a company asset. And we're a public company, and it's our responsibility to exploit those assets for the benefit of the company and its shareholders and we certainly intend to do that. Having said that, patents are an asset for any company. They do help the community. There are inventions that get published and the company is entitled to benefit from those inventions and after 17 years they fall into the public domain, so I think that's the way the system works. I don't think that should have any impact on us in terms of any regulatory fallout associated with that. It's just simply an asset that's growing, that's valuable and that we are looking at in ways we haven't looked at before.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $157 million in free cash flow. We processed 9.2 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.68 million net new names ending with 135.2 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.","Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our commitment to returning value to shareholders continued during the third quarter as we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $156 million. As of September 30, 2015, we have $605 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","As discussed on our last call, we're making progress as we prepare to launch the internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. Our launch preparations are proceeding according to plan as we prepare to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs toward the end of this year. We will provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.","I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 135.2 million, consisting of 120.1 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.4% year-over-year, as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. In the third quarter, we added 1.68 million net names to the domain name base after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations.","In the second quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 71.8% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2015 will be approximately 71.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2014.","As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.","During the third quarter, we saw strength in gross additions coming out of emerging and international markets, particularly in Asia. While we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we believe the pace of activity we saw during the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter. Also due to seasonal factors, the fourth quarter tends to have fewer net additions than the third quarter, as was seen in the last two years.","Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1.1 million and 1.6 million names.","As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. Our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E.

During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $154 million, up 10.7% from $139 million in the third quarter of 2014.","The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 58.1%, compared to 54.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $92 million, compared to $95 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the third quarter this year, compared to $0.69 for the third quarter last year.","As of September 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $794 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally.","Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.","I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.","As mentioned, revenue totaled $266 million for the third quarter. 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the third quarter totaled $940 million, a $50 million increase from year-end 2014.","Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, down from $102 million in the second quarter of 2015 and compared with $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 62.7% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter of 2014.","Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $103 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.78 based on our weighted average diluted share count of 131.7 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter based on $138.1 million and $133.3 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.","Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the third quarter were $155 million and $157 million respectively, compared with $168 million and $150 million respectively for the third quarter last year.","Also as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.055 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1.045 billion to $1.055 billion given on our last call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.","Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 61% and 62%. This has been narrowed from the 60% to 62% range given on our last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $108 million, narrowed from the $104 million to $110 million expense range given on our last call.","Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $37 million and $42 million, changed from $40 million and $50 million range given our last call.","In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, George. During the third quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. I'd like to expand a bit on what we think that actually means. I believe the best way to do that is to offer some long-term perspective on VeriSign's performance since the completion of our divestures five years or 20 quarters ago. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of non-core assets and to focus on profitability and value creation.","Since then, revenue has grown sequentially for 20 straight quarters. Non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $0.31 in Q4 2010 to $0.78 in Q3 2015. Free cash flow has grown steadily and was $612 million over the trailing four quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily from 44.3% in Q4 2010 to 62.7% in the most recent quarter. Over the last 20 quarters, we've returned $4.2 billion to our shareholders. We repurchased over 69 million shares for $3.22 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period, and in that same timeframe, we returned $982 million in special dividends, excluding payments to convert holders triggered by that special dividend.","Our $2.75 per share dividend in 2011 was a 100% tax-free return of capital. We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top line and bottom line, along with the consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure are what matter most to our shareholders.","We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework: protect, grow and manage is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent long-term result and simultaneously serve the interests of our shareholders, employees and customers. We intend to continue our steady focus on long-term consistency.","We'll now take your questions and Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks very much. Would love to get some color on the acceleration that we saw in growth in domain names, 9.2 million new. That's a number \u2013 I don't know the last time we saw a number that high. And you mentioned Asia, but maybe you could give us a little bit more color on, maybe what might have drove that strength?","George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure, Steve. This is George Kilguss. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did see 1.68 million net additions to the domain name base and as you pointed out, there were 9.2 million gross additions in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we saw continued strength in additions coming out of international markets, particularly Asia. Now that region includes markets such as China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, et cetera, and all those regions we've seen good growth in those regions.","We also mentioned that while we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we also believe that the pace of activity we saw in the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter. We did give guidance of 1.1 million to 1.6 million. The midpoint of that is about 1.35 million. If you recall, last year we did about 700,000 names in Q4 2014. So we do expect to have good net adds in the fourth quarter.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And so there was not promotional activity by registrars or anything out of the norm during the period in the Asian markets?","George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.","When you say out of the norm, I mean registrars do run promotional activities. I believe there is a few registrars that do some around certain holidays. But in most of our marketing programs, we put those in place throughout the year. So we continue to have a consistent level of spend or activity in those markets, but nothing unusual that I'm aware of from a marketing perspective.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Sorry. I would just add to that that nothing extraordinary and I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't just underlie George's comments with the fact that com is just a strong brand and it typically performs well and we see it continue to do so.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And just my last question is on the renewal rates, you projecting them to maybe go down a little bit to 71.8% in the fourth quarter. What \u2013 can you give us some color on what might be causing that to go down a little bit?","George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. So it's relatively flat year-over-year, Steve. We had 72% last year at this time, 71.8%, so we're talking about 20 basis points. But really the renewal rate is speaking to the registrations that were registered a year ago. We are seeing a little lower tick in the first-time renewal rate, but again that's more as we shift geographies and sell more into what we've talked about emerging markets, international markets, some of those markets have lower first-time renewal rates. But which have improved during the year, but at least quarter \u2013 year-over-year, we expect it to go \u2013 to be flat. But it \u2013 seasonally it tends to go down a little bit in the third quarter based on our historical activity.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Moving on, we'll go next to Sterling Auty at JPMorgan.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. It's actually Mina Confit (17:07) in for Sterling. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have two questions and I just got disconnected. So if you answered them in the meantime, I apologize. The first one is about the new domain name registrations. You had 9.2 million this quarter, which I think is the strongest in the recent quarters. So could you maybe talk a little bit about what might have been the driver for that? And also I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what kind of contribution we should see from the IDNs, if you have any updates on that. Thank you.","George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. So, as far as the strong adds in the quarter. Again, we saw good activity coming out of international markets, primarily Asia, but those markets I talked about earlier, China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam. We've seen growth in all those markets. So, we're very pleased with that growth over there. It seems to accelerate in the quarter. We're having a good month-to-date as well over there. So, we'll monitor that activity, but we've been \u2013 we guided up for the fourth quarter versus last year. We're guiding 1.1 million to 1.6 million, but good demand out of the Asia region is what we're seeing over there.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Great. And this is Jim. If I can just answer the second part of your question or your second question about IDNs. So, the news this quarter is that we are on track to begin a rollout and launch before the end of the year. I think it's early at this point to speculate about how they'll perform or provide any sort of guidance or revenue forecasts.","I will say that I think when we're talking to you a quarter from now, obviously the beginning of the rollout with the first IDN or IDNs at that time will give us some things to talk to you about and I'm sure when we're talking about Q1, 2015, by then, we'll actually have been in market. We'll be beyond rollout, we'll be in market and we'll certainly have more data for you or more to talk about then. So, early now, to speculate about any of those things. I think the important news is that we're on track and we're still tracking on our commitment of last quarter to begin our rollout before the end of the calendar year in 2015. That answered your questions?","Unknown Speaker","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","David Atchley - VeriSign, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel at Topeka Capital Markets.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets","Hi guys. So just a follow-up to the last question. When you say begin the roll out, do I take that to mean some will be out by the end of the year but not all? And as a follow-on to that question, how should we think about it in \u2013 or how do you guys think about it in terms of prioritizing the timing IDN by IDN?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, Fred. Yeah, so I think the first part of your question had an implicit assumption that is correct, that we are rolling them out in some sequence. I don't want to say that we're certainly not rolling them all out at the same time. And I don't want to say that we're going to roll them out one after the other individually and have 11 separate rollouts. There is going to be a phased rollout that's based on our preparations, market analysis, readiness, ICANN process, a lot of different factors that will go into that. What we do know for certain is that we will begin with the \u2013 with at least one IDN before the end of the year.","So there is some ICANN process that does play out here. There is a \u2013 an early period where brand holders have the ability to come in. There may be some early access opportunities for those who wish to get into the store early, so to speak. But that process will have begun before the end of the year. I expect that certainly by the turn of the year and in Q1, we will be with at least one. I think that's the only thing I can say comfortably without speculating, in-market. So we will be selling and there should be activity and we should be learning and we'll have more to talk about when we do talk about Q1 certainly. More to talk about after Q4, but a lot more to talk about after Q1.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets","Can you give us an update on what's going on with the .brand marketplace?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, I can give you a general high level update there. There were some delays associated with .brands in particular, as ICANN recognized that .brands had needs that were different beyond what ICANN had originally anticipated, different needs as opposed to those who are getting into the business of selling domain names. So, some contractual issues were worked on between the brand community and ICANN and additional time was given to the brands, I believe.","I don't have a specific number for you, but a number of brands that engaged in that process, some did sign contracts by a deadline. I believe there was another extension for some additional work by some brands who had special conditions, but we haven't seen a lot of them out in the market yet, but some of them have certainly announced their intentions to roll out their brand TLD. So, they're not visible. It's not that active, but there was some, quite a bit of activity, mostly contract signing with brands. So I would expect that next year you'll see some .brands in the market.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets","And is it still your sense that they're likely to opt for .brand as a complement to dot.com, as opposed to a replacement?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","I certainly think so. I think there are a lot of different ways to think about this, but there's just so much investment in the brand in the .com registration for most of these large brands. I think to use a metaphor that may not be exactly perfect, but I think will give you the idea. If you had a telephone number that you had invested heavily for years extensively in creating awareness for people to \u2013 call you and order your product and you \u2013 a different number became available and you opted for that. If it costs you $7.85 a year to continue to forward your old number to your new one, you'd do that for as long as you have any number of people calling it. But there are in some cases of these global brands, an extraordinarily large amount of traffic associated with their current domain. So, it's very easy for them to simply redirect that traffic to it.","So this is, I think you're getting to a question that I've answered in the past, which is that I don't expect these people who get a .brand to abandon their .com. They're certainly not going to do that, it is their brand. It's inexpensive for them, and there is a heavy investment in branding and traffic. So, I expect it to be either an experiment or a complementary registration, and we'll see how it plays out in the years ahead. But, I certainly don't expect people to abandon their .coms. I just don't think that's going to happen.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets","Okay, last question from me. Can you give us an update on your initiatives with security services, most notably DNS firewalls and DDoS?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, DDoS is one of the products that has been around for a while and is a main contributor to the product sales in our security services unit. The DNS firewall is new, still a bit early to really talk at any level of detail or sort of any generalized trends that we see. The reception is certainly good in the market, I'll say that. And, overall, the security services unit continues to grow, not at the point where we're reporting it separately, of course, but it is growing. And, we'll have more to say about that when it gets to a point where we can.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets","Okay, thanks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And, we'll go next to Priya Parasuraman with Wells Fargo Securities.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you, this is for Gray Powell. Just a question on the operating margins, which are strong this quarter. Any color on that? And, do you have any increases baked in for the new IDN launch expenses in your guidance?","George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.","So Priya, your first question was on the operating margin. Again, our operating expense for the quarter was $99 million. And if you look year-ago, that was about $101 million. So it's not \u2013 it's been around $100 million for a while. When I look sequentially of changes, there is really nothing that jumps out at me, per se, in our core. We had a little bit lower depreciation, maybe a little lower travel. In our sales and marketing, while it was down sequentially, if you look at the year-to-date nine-month period, it's relatively flat. There's really a timing of when we rolled expenses out. We rolled them out \u2013 those programs a little earlier this year than previous year. So you have some inter-quarter variances. But overall year-to-date from a sales and marketing, we're pretty much on track.","R&D we're down a little bit. We've optimized some of our spend in our R&D area and we have a slight head count decrease. And then G&A, we had some legal expenses increase. But overall, if you read on our 10-Q, we expect those major categories to be consistent over the next quarter or so with what we've just rolled out there or just produced.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","And I would just add to that, with respect to the comments that I made earlier. There isn't a specific focus on the operating margin, per se, by itself. The operating margin is a fairly consistent trend line, if you draw it over the last five years or the 20 quarters, moving slowly and steadily in a positive direction. And it's \u2013 the real focus for us is that it allows us to move the important trend lines of top-line revenue and profit forward and pursue our long-term strategy. I think those are really the important issues. There are always gives and takes, as George said, but again, from a $102 million the year-ago quarter to $99 million this year, I think is roughly equivalent in our view and allows us to continue the trend lines that we're really focused on.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then one more, if I may. Any thoughts on seasonality for domain name growth? Looking out towards 2016, I know it's early but I was curious if you think the international growth might skew the seasonality somewhat for 2016?","George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, we'll give you guidance next quarter on our views on 2016, Priya. We can just tell you, if you look at this year, clearly Q1 was a strong quarter from a net adds perspective and Q3 clearly was \u2013 Q2 tends to be a little bit lower because of how the deletes come into the base with a lot of the strong adds in Q1 with a 45-day grace period. It tends to slightly increase deletes a little bit in the second quarter. And then the fourth quarter, December has a lot of holidays in the month and globally a lot of countries take holidays off. So, December tends to be a short month for us, and so we tend to see the fourth quarter seasonally be a little lower sequentially than third quarter. But we'll give you some more color on our views on 2016 next quarter.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Walter Pritchard at Citi.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Hi. Thanks. George, I'm wondering if you can talk about from a sales and marketing perspective on those expenses were probably the area that your OpEx was the lightest versus what we were looking for and I see you did have good strength in names. Did you make a trade-off there in terms of sort of marketing programs that you peeled back during the quarter as you saw the strength? And generally how should we think about the level of sales and marketing, especially marketing spend as we go into Q4 and into early next year?","George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Walter. So, there was no conscious effort to pull any programs. As I mentioned earlier to a caller, if you look at the nine-month year-to-date expense in sales and marketing, it's relatively flat. We did this year roll some expenses \u2013 I'm sorry, roll some programs out a little earlier in the year. So, a little bit frontloaded. If you look at it on a quarterly basis, we had slightly higher sales and marketing in Q1 and Q2. It's just kind of how it fell this year. We constantly evaluate our programs, but they seem to be performing well. As far as Q4, we expect the expense in sales and marketing to be consistent with what it was this quarter.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We have no additional questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Atchley for any concluding remarks. Sir?","David Atchley - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, Operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation.

Good afternoon everyone.","Our third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.","We reported revenue of $255 million, which was 4.7% higher year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including $150 million in free cash flow. The base of .com and .net active registered domain names ended the quarter at 130 million. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline.","As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 4.2 million shares for $226 million. At the end of the third quarter, $833 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","Before I get into the third quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call.","As you recall, VeriSign began to engage in a negotiating and contracting process with ICANN on our remaining 13 new gTLD applications, which primarily consists of transliterations of .com and .net, earlier this year. We have been in discussions with ICANN during this contracting period and have requested certain modifications to the registry agreements that would govern these new top level domains.","As we have not yet reached a final agreement, ICANN has granted an extension of time until December 30, 2014 to execute the new agreements for all but our .verisign application, where the deadline is July 29th, 2015.","Also in regards to our back-end registry customers' new gTLD applications, 5 of our customers' new gTLDs are now delegated into the zone. As a reminder, most of our back-end registry customers have applications for .brand gTLDs. New gTLD applications that qualified as a .brand by ICANN have the opportunity to apply for an extension to execute their registry agreement for a period which ends July 29th, 2015, and many of our customers applied for this extension.","Finally, Richard Goshorn, our General Counsel, Senior Vice President and Secretary, has tendered his resignation effective November 14, 2014, to pursue other opportunities. Thomas Indelicarto, currently an Associate General Counsel at VeriSign, will become Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective November 14, 2014. Tom joined VeriSign in 2006 and his lengthy experience with the company in senior legal roles will ensure a seamless transition.","Over the past several years, we have successfully refocused the company through the completion of our divestiture plan, renewed key contracts, and created process efficiencies. Rick has been an integral leader in these, as well as many other strategic initiatives. Our shareholders have been well served by the company's restructuring over the last 7 years. We thank Rick for his important contributions to helping make VeriSign the company it is today and wish him the very best.","I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 130 million, consisting of 114.9 million for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.3% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we added 1.15 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.","In the second quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 71.8% compared with 72.7% for the second quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72%. This rate compares to 72.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2013.","As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive zone growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity, and changes in registrar go-to-market strategies. Also as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first time renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions, as well as other factors.","Last quarter, we indicated an expected improvement in Q3 and Q4 from the levels we experienced in Q2. This stabilization appears to be on track as we generated 1.15 million net registrations in Q3. As a result, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2014 net additions to the zone to be between 0.7 million and 1.2 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim and good afternoon everyone. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $255 million, up 4.7% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $139 million, up 5.1% from $133 million in the third quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 54.7%, compared to 54.5% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $95 million compared to $81 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.69 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.53 for the third quarter last year.","As of September 30, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which, $599 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Liabilities totaled $3 billion at the end of the quarter.","I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2014 full year guidance.","As mentioned, revenue totaled $255 million for the third quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $893 million, a $37 million increase from year end 2013. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared with $98 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter expanded to 60.6% compared to 58.8% in the same quarter of 2013.","Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $97 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.59 in the third quarter of 2013 and $0.68 last quarter.","We had a weighted average diluted share count of 138 million shares in the third quarter compared to 141 million shares in the second quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 13.2 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter, compared with 10.5 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter repurchase activity and the weighted affect of the 4.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter.","Operating cash flow was $168 million for the third quarter compared to $121 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $134 million in the third quarter last year. Third quarter free cash flow was $150 million.","With respect to taxes, we continue to use a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. However, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years.","In 2014, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million, which primarily relate to international taxes including the $28 million in foreign withholding tax on the repatriation completed during the second quarter.","As stated in our news release from August 18, 2014, the upside trigger on our convertible debentures has been met for the 6-month interest payment period from August 15, 2014, to February 14, 2015. As a result, contingent interest of approximately $5.2 million will be paid on the February 15, 2015 for the -- for this initial semiannual period.","With respect to our 2014, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and capital expenditure projections. Revenue for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of $1,006,000,000 to $1,011,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 4.5%. This is a change from the $1,003,000,000 to $1,012,000,000 given on our last earnings call.","Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.","Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 60% and 61%, changed from the 59% to 61% range we gave during our last call.","Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $76 million and $80 million for 2014 and includes the contingent interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures.","Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. This is a change from the $50 million to $60 million range given on our last call.","Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, the company demonstrated sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q3 2013. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. During the third quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business. We continue to protect the business by providing over 17 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com DNS. This track record is due to the skill of our people and our specialized infrastructure. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. Also, we continue to invest in the development of new products and services.","Finally, we've been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position, and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases during the third quarter. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim, the net domain name activity improved actually very nicely in Q3 after a challenging first half in terms of the 1.15 million net adds. And I know some of this is seasonality, at least relative to Q2 anyway. But is there anything else in particular that you would attribute the rebound to?","D. James Bidzos","I'll let George comment on that. I'll just say that I think we did forecast last quarter. We were quite clear that we believe that our data and our modeling showed that we would see a stabilization in Q3 and Q4. So I think first of all, our modeling systems are serving us well, as what we projected actually did occur. I will just comment as well that Q3 was a record for Q3 gross adds. So the business is strong. I think it's calm as a trusted brand. And I think that, that's primarily at the heart of it, but I'll let George add some comments as well.","George E. Kilguss","Yes sure, Gregg. As Jim mentioned, the net adds came in at 1.15 in the quarter, which was at the high end of our guidance. And gross registrations were really the reason that we got to the high end. 8.7 million was clearly up sequentially in both year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, it was the highest Q3 on record. And in gross registrations, we have really seen China continue to be a growth engine for us. China performed very, very well internationally. We also actually saw one of our large U.S. registers -- registrars -- also refocus on customer acquisition and began using discounts to acquire domain names for their customers. And so we also saw some benefit here domestically as well.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay terrific. And then looking within the TLDs, so .net is obviously much smaller than .com, but the .net names in the base did decline again, albeit very slightly this quarter. And I really wanted to get a sense of how you view this going forward. Do you think that we'll continue to see this go a bit lower? Or do you think that .net will resume growth at some point going forward?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, so look, .net zone growth has been relatively flat all year. We believe, like other gTLDs, .net is experiencing some headwinds from the launch of the new gTLD program that happened earlier this year, about February. That program, that new gTLD program, has accumulated about 2.8 million registrations so far this year. But -- so we are seeing some headwinds from that. As far as long-term, we'll give some views at our next call, but I think it really depends on how the market digests those new gTLDs. There's a number of them coming out. There is quite a bit of confusion in the marketplace, and I think it's having some effects on the industry as a total -- as a whole.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just one last one, if I could, for Jim. Would love to hear an update on the patent portfolio and any potential new services.","D. James Bidzos","Okay. We haven't provided any specific updates this quarter. We continue to invest and work on the development on a number of new initiatives and we are making progress on those. But no update on those and no specific news with respect to the patent program other than it's an active program. And, of course, we're very busy and active in filing patents for our innovative inventions here.","Operator","And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Ken Wong for Walter. On -- you mentioned some traction with your partners on gTLDs running their back-end registries. Can you give us a sense, now that you've got a few of those under your belt, how customers are going about kind of paying for that product line? Is it a fixed cost? Are you guys getting some piece of the transactional element? Help us understand how that revenue model starts to flow through.","Patrick S. Kane","This is Pat Kane. Depending upon the type of TLD it is, it varies. And so if it's a brand customer, it certainly is a flat fee that we do because it's small numbers of registrations. But if it's going to be a more widely distributed customer, they tend to be more minimum payments and then per-domain fees on top of that.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. So far, these early days, it's more of the flat fee variety since it's mostly the brands, right?","Patrick S. Kane","Well, we've only had 5 go in, so far, that are active. And since most of the ones that we have remaining are brands, we'll see most of those come online in 2015.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And then Jim, you mentioned that you guys had reached out to ICANN to modify your contracts for the transliterations of .com\/.net. Kind of what exactly are you trying to get changed? And then how does that potentially impact how you go to market with those particular domains?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I don't think there's actually time to go into the very specifics. We are in what's -- this is essentially a contract negotiation, so we are in that negotiating phase with ICANN for our IDN applications. And just to -- in addition to what Pat said, I want to say that any brands, essentially, were allowed an extension -- to seek an extension to June 29th -- or was it July 29th?","Unknown Executive","July.","D. James Bidzos","July 29, 2015. That includes our .verisign brand and, of course, that would include the brands that we're providing the back-end services for. In the case of our own non-brand IDN applications, ICANN allows up to a 9-month extension, depending on your request and the circumstances. So without going into the details of our negotiation, we were given an extension beyond the September deadline until December 30th of this year. So we have basically a little over a couple of months to complete the negotiating phase that we're in with ICANN. I think I would say that this is a contract negotiation. This is what ICANN's Board envisioned when they authorized the form of agreement and the negotiating period, so we're engaged in the process. I just don't think I can, or it doesn't make sense, and I really can't go into all of those details. But the new date is December 30th of this year.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. Okay. So look for something potentially Q1 timeframe. And I guess last thing for George, I note the G&A expense kind of ticked up a bit in Q3 and overall, I think you guys take care [ph] of the margins. Just wondering if anything we should think about there.","George E. Kilguss","In the G&A, nothing really jumps out to me, Ken. I mean, on a GAAP basis, we did see our stock-based compensation go up a little bit quarter-over-quarter and that's primarily because we have our annual director grants hit us in Q3. And we also use variable accounting for a portion of our performance stock units. And as the stock price is up a little over $6 in the quarter, our stock-based compensation increased a little bit as a result of that. But as far as core expenses, I mean, there were a few movements between the line items, but as I mentioned last quarter, I think you should expect that as we continue to actively manage the business.","Operator","And from JPMorgan, we'll go next to Sterling Auty.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to revisit, you made the comment of headwinds that gTLDs have made on the .net base. Is there any concern that you'll see enough headwinds in .com that the .com could get to the point where it's flat or declining like .net is?","D. James Bidzos","This is Jim. I think when George said that .net was seeing some headwinds from the confusion associated with new gTLDs, I think generally, .net may be more susceptible to that confusion that swirls around new gTLDs. We're talking about hundreds that have already been delegated into the zone and hundreds more coming. So I think there's some consumer and business confusion associated with all of those. There are many plurals and I think .net is maybe more susceptible to that aspect of the new gTLD program. As I mentioned earlier, .com is going to be celebrating its 30th year in 2015 next year. .com is and is also -- .com also enjoys the longest track record of uninterrupted DNS service, 100% uptime in excess of 17 years now. So I think .com is just a strong brand and strong -- and for that reason, it's a trusted brand. And strong, trusted brands always do well. So I think that's the slight differentiation I would point out between .com and .net, that I think .net is more likely to be -- to fall into that category of different or, in this case, new gTLDs, and possibly be more susceptible to issues surrounding the confusion, which I'm afraid may -- it's going to continue. I mean, we're seeing hundreds of more new gTLDs coming and they're coming at the rate of many every single week. So there -- that confusion is likely to get worse.","George E. Kilguss","And Sterling, I would just like add, I mean, .net was 15.1 million names in the zone versus 15.2 million names. I mean, it's been relatively flat. And so I actually think .net has held up pretty well over the year with all these new names coming on, bringing new names confusion. So I don't view .net's performance as anything negative. I just think it hasn't maybe grown as much or it's been a little flattish just because of the comments Jim was talking about, about the name confusion.","D. James Bidzos","Yes. Again, .com is a strong brand for the reason of trust, security and stability. I would just point out again that this was the largest net new add -- sorry, largest gross adds in Q3 on record. And this is -- now, we're almost a year into the launch of hundreds of new gTLDs. I think that just points out what the security and stability of .com and the trusted brand of .com represent.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you, got you. And now, looking at the guidance that you gave for name additions for the fourth quarter, how much of that is expectation of continued good gross additions on the top versus improved renewal rates? And maybe a comment on how you see the quarter has started. I think it's probably a little bit slower than last year, but obviously, we're at a different point this year, I think, in terms of cycle.","George E. Kilguss","Yes, Sterling. So I mean, we guided 0.7 million to 1.2 million net registrations for the quarter. You did mention that we're out to a little bit of a slow pace in the month of October, but what you have to keep in mind or what I would like to let you know is that there was a -- there's a national Chinese holiday called National Day, which happens the 1st week of October. So as China becomes a larger part of our domain name business, it tends to impact seasonally a little bit more in the months when these holidays occur. So that happened for 7 days in the first month of October and slowed additions a little bit during that time. So we'll see what the zone does. You and I will see it as it's printed on the website. But if you even took where we were today and annualized it, you'd come to the low end of guidance even with that holiday in there. So we feel pretty comfortable with the range that we've articulated there.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Last -- [indiscernible]","D. James Bidzos","Sorry, if I could just add something, this is Jim. I think another thing to consider with respect to the renewal rate, which you mentioned as well, is that at 72%, which I described in my opening remarks, the renewal rate has ranged between 70% and 74% for the last 5 years. And so we're dead center in the middle of that range.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No. All right, that made sense. Last question is, maybe I didn't really hear a lot of color on the non-naming business, so the other areas. Any particular comments that you could give in terms of how it performed in the quarter? Any changes in outlook?","D. James Bidzos","There's no update -- there's no news that we're actually delivering this quarter other than to say that we're -- if you're referring specifically to the NIA business, we're pleased with the development there, but of course, we're not calling that out separately. And we are aggressively pursuing a number of initiatives in which we are making progress, but there's just no update this quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel with Topeka Capital Markets.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","As I understand it, ICANN for their fiscal '15 budget was originally using something in excess of 30 million new gTLDs. That number, apparently, is now 15 million and most people think that number is way too high. So does that all tie back to confusion, contracting? Are people deciding to just move back to .com? Or what dynamics are at work in that?","Patrick S. Kane","Fred, this is Pat. What I would start off with, as far as the projections go, you're probably best off asking ICANN or better yet, maybe the registrars that actually sell the domains as to what they're thinking. But as Jim mentioned earlier, it's quite possible, and we believe, and we've -- and I've certainly seen written many times that there is additional confusion in the space, whether you have singles, plurals, who's going to buy what in terms of the different areas, what the communities look like, et cetera, and what still has to come out. So I think that there is some confusion. And I think, as Jim pointed out, with all these domains, the TLD that roll out every week, you'll see more and more confusion, I believe.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Atchley, I'll turn the call back to you, sir.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call.

Please go ahead, sir.","David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's second quarter 2017 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.","This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There, you will also find our second quarter 2017 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.","The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open the call for your questions.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 and $171 million in free cash flow.","During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150.5 million. Our financial position is strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.3 million, consisting of 129.2 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 0.68 million net names during the second quarter after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations.","Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017 will be 73.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2016. We are updating the full year 2017 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 2.75%. Also, we expect the domain name base to increase during the third quarter between 0.8 million to 1.3 million registrations.","I'll comment now on a few recent events. In June, the .net registry agreement between VeriSign and ICANN was successfully renewed. The new agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as pricing terms, renewal rights, the six-year term, or fees paid to ICANN. Also in June, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.75% coupon maturing in 10 years. This offering closed in early July and we're pleased with the results of this issuance.","Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2018, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $8.20 to $9.02. We believe this positions .net competitively in the marketplace while keeping .net priced lower than other popular legacy TLDs.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers.","As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the second quarter totaled $175 million, compared with $176 million in the second quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.6% compared to 61.5% in the same quarter a year ago.","Net income totaled $123 million compared to $113 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.87 for the second quarter last year. (5:42) the second quarter include a pre-tax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.09.","As Jim mentioned earlier, the company continues to manage its capital structure. Earlier this month we took advantage of what we felt were favorable market conditions and added another long-term fixed-rate piece of debt into our capital structure. The 10-year note issuance, which totaled $550 million, is scheduled to mature on July 15, 2027, and carried an interest rate of 4.75%. As this offering closed in early July, our second quarter ending balance sheet does not reflect the net proceeds from this issuance.","As of June 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $269 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.","I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million, as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $130 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares. This compares to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.96 last quarter, based on 130.6 million and 124.5 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. Results for the second quarter included pre-tax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.06.","As noted in our last earnings call, beginning with the second quarter financials, we are now using a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting non-GAAP results. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $181 million and free cash flow was $171 million, compared with $167 million and $161 million respectively for the second quarter last year.","Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 22.5 million shares, based on average share price during the second quarter, compared with 21.9 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 21.3 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter.","With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.155 billion to $1.165 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.145 billion to $1.160 billion range provided on our prior earnings call.","Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% to 65.25%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million, as compared with the $93 million to $100 million range provided on our last call, reflecting the additional senior note interest expense from the recent issuance.","Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, changed from the $35 million to $45 million range provided on our last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures.","As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow the tax benefits to continue to accrue.","In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2017.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, George. In closing, during the second quarter we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We have marked some significant milestones since our last call. In addition to renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN for another six years, earlier this month the company surpassed 20 continuous years of 100% availability in the .com and .net DNS. This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure.","We believe our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trendlines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.","We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you We'll go first to Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks. This is Matt Lemenager on for Rob. Question on the strength of the domain name activity, quarter to date, in the guidance, it's a little bit above maybe what we expected, at least a few quarters ago, at 0.8 million to 1.3 million. So as we think about what is driving that strength, is there any direction that you can point to us? Is it perhaps promotional activity, or international domain name ads? I don't know if there's any color you could add there.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","I think probably the biggest contributors there are, there is some strengthening in the economy. There's more economic activity, which generally contributes to domain name growth. But I also think the strong brands that .com and .net represent, they're strong, recognized, trusted global brands, are showing their strength and contributed to that good performance as well.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","The only other point I'd put on that, Rob, is as you saw in the first quarter, we had also good demand coming out of the U.S. market, and that strength in the U.S. continued into the second quarter.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks. And then just one other question on the expense structure. Is there any expenses that are kind of more second half weighted? As we think about the EBIT margin guidance we've kind of been above, or at the high end of that range for the full-year guide. Is there anything for the second half, that's maybe expenses that are second-half-specific, that would cause that EBIT margin to come in at that lower end of that guide?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, we provided our guidance for our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year just now, but as far as how expenses flow, what we've outlined in our 10-Q is we do expense our sales and marketing expenses to be higher in the second half of the year, but we'll continue to manage all the expenses of the business, and we expect to be within the non-GAAP operating margin of between 64.5% to 64.25% just given earlier.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Hey. Hi guys, this is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. Just to expand on the domain name question, you said about the strengthening economy in the U.S. that is driving the growth in domains. What are you seeing within the international market currently, versus what you saw about a year ago? And how should we think about it going forward?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, there's a \u2013 let me see if I understand your question properly. By international markets, I can point to one thing that has changed. We did mention in several past quarters that the so-called China surge, which began in late 2015 and continued into 2016, including the second quarter, of course, affected renewals through 2017. We believe now that, that effect, the China effect, so to speak, has pretty much pushed through the system. So I think that might be a factor. Certainly, some activity I would point to in terms of international market.","There is general strong growth in the international market. But as George pointed out, some growth in the U.S. market in the first quarter continued into the second market as well. So there are good signs, there's general growth outside the U.S. and then economic activity in the U.S. has contributed to some continuing growth here.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Perfect. That's really helpful. And another one on expenses. Operating margins came somewhere around 65.3% versus somewhere 66% we were estimating. Any particular expenses that were higher within the quarter that led to the dinging of margins?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","So we did see a slight increase in G&A expense in the quarter. During the quarter we purchased some additional software licenses for the core business, and we also had slightly higher legal fees in the quarter. But again, on a non-GAAP basis, we were pretty much flat. We can consistently be around about $100 million non-GAAP operating expense level.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Okay. And if I could sneak one more in, where are you currently in the .web antitrust suit, and what is a normal procedure and timeline you're expecting with that particular suit?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, there's really no update to provide on .web at this point. With respect to our interactions with the Department of Justice, we continue to cooperate with DOJ as it pertains to the CID we discussed last quarter. That dialogue is constructive, has been constructive. We produced documents and information. We'd answered questions as needed, and we're meeting with the department. So that's an ongoing process, and beyond that, there's really nothing to say at this point.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Perfect. Thank you so much guys.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Just I guess to start off, a follow-up on one of those last questions. I was wondering if you might be able to, George, put a finer point on the amount of excess G&A expense in Q2, just for us to get a little bit more of a normalized sense of the OpEx.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, I'm not sure what you mean by excess expense, Greg. I mean, we continue to manage all the lines of expenses throughout the business pretty much on a quarterly and monthly basis. And each quarter, there's always going to be some type of expense that comes in that might not have been planned or one might call non-recurring. But I think if you continue to call those out, any expense you could almost view as non-recurring.","As I said, in the quarter we did purchase some additional software licenses in the quarter, and we did have some higher legal costs in the quarter, But we will have, from time to time, the need to purchase additional software licenses in the business, and we'll have the need to spend additional money from a legal perspective for the company. And so again, I'd look back at the big picture. On a non-GAAP basis, total expense was a little over $100 million, $100.7 million. And compared to last quarter, which was a similar amount, and year-over-year, I believe it was $99 million a year ago quarter versus $100 million there.","We did have a little bit higher stock-based compensation in the quarter on a GAAP basis, and that's really a function of two areas. One, since last year, we have brought on some additional senior management to the company, in particular, if you looked at our website, we brought on an SVP of Product. And then we also, as a senior management team, do have some longer-term incentive programs, and as we continue to execute on our plan and deliver on the results over and above some of the goals that were set, we do have some accelerators that get accrue there as we continue to execute. So we'll continue to try to do that.","But again, from a GAAP perspective, we had a little bit more stock-based compensation. And as I said, we had a few other nits and that in the quarter. But in general, very consistent with the year-ago period as well as sequentially.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, just one other question. As you noted in your prepared remarks, you recently issued a little over $500 million in debt. Are you looking to put that to work in relatively short order, or can you give us an update on what you plan to do with the cash? Thanks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. So as you point out, we absolutely added some additional debt to capital structure. And as you know, as a company, we try to actively manage that capital structure. One of the things that we clearly look at and monitor is our ability to raise debt in the market, our ability to execute it, and also what interest rate we can do that. And when we looked at the market, we felt that where the market was, it was an attractive time for us to go add other piece of long-term capital to our capital structure.","So as far as use of proceeds, as we mentioned in the offering, we plan to use those proceeds for general corporate purposes. That would also include potential share repurchases. As you know from following us, we don't guide to share repurchases, but we try to be very prudent with the capital of the company and we'll continue to look for ways to generate positive returns for the shareholders.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And with that, I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks.","David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, operator.

Please go ahead, sir.","David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.","This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There, you will also find our first quarter 2017 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited. And our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC; specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.","The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.","We reported revenue of $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $0.96, up 12% year-over-year, and $139 million in free cash flow. As part of managing our business during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million.","Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.6 million, consisting of 128.4 million names for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.4 million net names during the first quarter, after processing 9.5 million new gross registrations. The U.S. market contributed to the better-than-expected performance.","Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2017 will be approximately 72.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the final renewal rate was 67.6%, compared with 73.3% for the same quarter of 2015.","As noted in our prior conference calls, the portion of registrations associated with the China name search that occurred in the first quarter of 2016 continued to renew at lower-than-historic first time renewal rates in the first and second quarter of 2017, and are contributing to slightly higher deletions in the first half of 2017. In addition, Q2 tends to have slightly lower seasonal new gross registrations than Q1.","Based on these and other factors, we now expect full-year 2017 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2.5%, with a change to the domain name base for the second quarter of 2017 of flat to an increase of 0.4 million net registrations.","As many of you are aware, we are in a process of renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN, as the current terms ends on June 30. On April 20, ICANN posted the new .net registry agreement for public comment, which is open until May 30.","From our perspective, the posted agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as the fees paid to ICANN, the renewal rights or the six-year term. We believe we are on track for renewal prior to the expiration of the current term agreement.","Finally, as discussed during our prior earnings call, we decided it was in the best interest of the company to sell our iDefense business. The iDefense sale was completed at the start of the second quarter and VeriSign continues as a customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 40% was from foreign customers.","As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the first quarter totaled $175 million, up 5.1% from $167 million in the first quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.7%, compared to 59.2% in the same quarter a year ago.","Net income totaled $116 million compared to $107 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.94 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.82 for the first quarter last year.","As of March 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $316 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.","I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance.","As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million as compared to $103 million in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily a result of lower marketing spend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 65.1%, compared to 63.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.5 million shares. This compares to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.92 last quarter based on 131.6 million and 125.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.","For the past two years, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 25%. As a result, we will begin to use a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting second quarter 2017 non-GAAP results.","Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $148 million and free cash flow was $139 million, compared with $150 million and $143 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.3 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter, compared with 21.1 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 20.6 million shares last quarter.","The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.","With respect to full-year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.145 billion to $1.160 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.138 billion to $1.158 billion range provided on our prior earnings call. Full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 64.5% and 65.25%, increased and narrowed from the 64% to 65% range as provided on our last call.","Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And cash taxes for the year are now expected to be between $20 million to $30 million, changed from the $15 million to $25 million range provided on our last call.","As previously mentioned, the majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said last quarter, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention, based on current conditions, is to not redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow these cash tax benefits to continue to accrue.","The financial guidance provided reflects the completion of our iDefense asset sale on April 1, 2017. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2017.","Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, George. In closing, during the first quarter, we expanded our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus to provide long-term value to our shareholders. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.","We will now take your questions. And, Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today will come from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions, I want to start with \u2013 I think I saw the gross additions in the quarter were 9.5 million [name registrations]. And if I compare that to pre-uplift from China, that's still pretty good. That's still up from, I want to say, like the high 8.8 million, somewhere in that range. Just wondering what you're seeing as the factors that are helping the gross additions in the quarter?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Sterling. This is George. In short, we saw increased demand from the U.S.-based registrars in the quarter, which was aided, in part, by what we call domain name-centric advertising by several channel partners in and around the Super Bowl, which happened in the February timeframe.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And looking at it, any change in duration of those names? I think you used to talk about maybe kind of 15, 16 month average durations when you average everything together. Is that still the same across the .com and .net base?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Yes. That hasn't changed too much over the years. That's still very consistent.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And you mentioned lower marketing spend in the quarter versus the fourth quarter. How should we think about the marketing spend seasonality-wise through the rest of the year, so we could think about the shape of the margins towards the guidance goal?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","You are correct, Sterling. That marketing spend was down sequentially. The reason behind that is partly because Q4 was so high, we had a large amount of marketing spend going into the market in Q4.","And then, with regard to our marketing spend this year, the timing of our marketing activities are more heavily weighted toward events later in the year than last year. So, as we've outlined in our 10-Q, our expectation for marketing expense is to increase as a percent of sales in the subsequent quarters.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And very last question, if I could sneak it in, I didn't get a chance to look through, but how much did you actually get? What were the proceeds for iDefense?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","We're not disclosing the sale proceeds from iDefense.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","They were not material.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","I think there might be some more information available in the next quarter since the sale actually closed in Q2, but the sale of iDefense was not a material event.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question will come from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple, if I may. So I might be looking at this wrong, but when I look at the zone files, it looks like domain additions have turned negative so far in April. Your guidance is flat to plus 400,000 [domain additions]. So, I guess, is there anything going on in the first few weeks of the new quarter? Is there any like residual churn from China or just something that I'm potentially missing? Thanks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","I think you're seeing the final sort of move out of the China search names. There were some that carried over into April and we're seeing the final deletions of the so-called China search names from late 2015 and 2016.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then can you give us an update on the international transliterations of .com and .net that you have up and running today? And then just what are your expectations for additional launches over the course of the next year?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","We have three of the transliterations in market, two in Korea and one in Japan. At this point, we don't have any additional details on any additional launches. In China, we are still going through the licensing process to operate our Chinese IDNs, but no additional details to share at this time and we'll provide more information on these and future roll-outs as appropriate.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And then last one, if I may. Just any update on the .web antitrust investigation?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","No substantive update. We continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice relative to the CID that we discussed last quarter. Those interactions and dialogues have been constructive. We're producing documents and information and answering their questions as needed. So it's an ongoing process. Nothing substantive to update now. But, of course, as soon as there is, we'll share it with you.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.211 billion to $1.216 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.205 billion to $1.215 billion range provided on our last call.","Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 67% and 67.5%, increased and narrowed from the 66% to 67% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million to $84 million, decreased and narrowed from the $82 million to $89 million range provided on our last call.","Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $40 million to $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are still expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, unchanged from our last call.","In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, George. The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues. We generated and efficiently returned value to our shareholders.","We continue to work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will go first to Sterling Auty at JPMorgan.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Hey, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. So, you mention about your agreement with NeuStar to actually sell your Security Service, just so that we can model the out-years perfectly, how much revenue were you getting from that other business and how much margins did that particular business have?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Ugam, this is George, thanks for the question. As I'm sure you're aware, DSS is not a material contributor to our overall business. If the transaction closes before year-end, we do not expect a material impact to our 2018 guidance and we will provide 2019 full-year guidance on our Q4 call which will include any impacts from the transaction once it closes.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Okay, cool. And on the Cooperative Agreement, you mentioned that it can be amended before the expiration date, but given \u2013 if supposed say, the process continued, is there a provision where the Cooperative Agreement can be extended for six months until which you are in the negotiation period?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","I don't have any comments beyond my prepared remarks, so I'll just reiterate that we're progressing with the NTIA to amend the Cooperative Agreement by mutual agreement and that we are confident than an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term at the end of November, so more when we can.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","All right ,and if I could squeeze one last one in. If you see the operating margins for the current quarter, you see that much of the leverage came from sales and marketing expense. Is it something where it is \u2013 it will be the normal course of business that we see such kind of margins? I know you provided 2018 guidance but just from a qualitative perspective, was there a shift of timing of expenses in the quarter or is it like more that the focus of the business in terms of the investment has changed?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","So, with regard to our Q3 expenses, as you can see and from a non-GAAP basis, our total expenses were about $96 million and we're relatively flat both year-over-year and sequentially. However, as you point out, we did see some movements between the categories. Sequentially, we did have a slight decrease in sales and marketing which was offset by small increases in G&A and cost of goods sold. Now, specifically with sales and marketing sequentially we were down about $2.5 million quarter to quarter, and that primarily was a result of lower direct marketing activities in the quarter.","As you may recall, we increased our direct marketing activities late in 2017 with the intent to do more in 2018. However, as we pursued more direct marketing activities outside of the U.S., we found it took and \u2013 it is taking frankly us longer to execute on those direct marketing activities abroad. So really, no change, just I would say the normal ebb and flow of how marketing expenses get deployed into the marketplace.","Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.","Awesome. Thank you so much, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to you, Matthew Wells, at Citi.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. This is Matt Wells and I'm on for Walter Pritchard. I was just curious, what was the catalyst for transitioning your Security Services business to NeuStar? Is there anything to read into the timing here relative to the co-op?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","No, this is completely independent. It is a decision we made to focus exclusively on our core mission. As you know we operate a great deal of critical infrastructure where we do resolution, of course not only for .com and .net but for .gov and .edu. We do Root Zone management, we operate 2 of the 13 Internet root service and we just decided that focus wasn't consistent with continued pursuit of that business, and transitioning it to NeuStar made sense for that reason, timing independent of anything else that's going on.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, that's helpful. I know I think last time we spoke the .web process was still hung up with ICANN and timing sounded like it was a little uncertain. Do you have any more clarity on that process or where it stands?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","No, no updates at this time. I hope to have some in the near future but nothing to say at this time.","Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks. And that's it for me.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Okay, Matt, thank you.","Operator","And moving next to Rob Oliver at Robert W. Baird.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, good afternoon. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob. So, my question was on the sales and marketing expense as well. George, you mentioned that it was taking a little longer to execute, so is that something \u2013 should we expect that to kind of tick back up, is it still a priority to get that level deployed \u2013 those marketing expenses deployed, so is that something we should expect to tick back up going forward and maybe into 2019.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Well \u2013 as I said earlier, we'll provide 2019 guidance on our next call. But \u2013 look, we are constantly trying to invest in marketing activities. I think the goal there is for domain name sales to increase with marketing activities and we fully pursue activities that we think will drive those results. We have switched year-over-year. We have done more direct marketing this year than we've done in prior years, and I just think we've executed some great campaigns in a variety of markets. But as I said, sometimes the international markets are taking a little bit longer to get that work through. So, I don't think anything is really different there. We continue to focus and make investments in marketing and hopefully that produces increases in domain name sales.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then, my second question was on, Jim, the number of new names processes ticked up nicely this year and been kind of 9.5 million or above each quarter. What's been driving you think, was there any trends or any higher level comments that you could say driving the increase in the number of domains this year?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","I will ask George to comment. I will just say that .com is an incredibly strong brand, you hear me say this all the time and I can't emphasize it enough quite frankly. It's a brand that gets a tremendous amount of exposure, it's the brand that gives you credibility worldwide for your online presence, and I think that has a great deal to do with the continued strength that .com is showing. But George, if you'd like to add some color, please feel free.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Matt, as you've observed Q3 was a good quarter for us, we delivered 2 million net ads in the quarter which was up from 1.5 million net ads in the third quarter of 2017, and that improvement is primarily result of gross ads. As you point out, gross ads totaled 9.5 million in the quarter. They were up from 8.9 million a year ago. And this was really the same trend that we have witnessed and reported on pretty much all year. We've had continued gross ads performance from both North American and China registrars. They seem to be performing better this year than they did previously and that's been a trend that we've seen in previous quarters and it's continued here into the third quarter. So, again I think it's the strong brand in both those markets and we'll continue to execute on marketing activities to accentuate that brand message into the marketplace.","Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And with no additional questions at this time, Mr. Atchley, I'll turn things back over to you for any final comments.","David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, operator.

There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings release.","At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were in line with our objective of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.","During 2014, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1.010 billion in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $568 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 60.2%.","Exceeding $1 billion marks a significant growth and an important milestone since the completion of our divestiture program in 2010, a year in which we reported $681 million in revenues.","Operationally, 2014 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 34 million new domain name registrations and finished the year with 130.6 million names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 17 years of uninterrupted availability of the .com and .net domain name systems.","As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 3.7 million shares for $209 million.","During the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares for $867 million.","Effective January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $453 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration.","Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.","Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","As you recall, one way VeriSign participated in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of .com and .net, as well as .verisign and .comsec. We have signed the registry agreements for. comsec and 11 IDN TLDs, 8 of which are transliterations of .com and 3 are transliterations of .net.","While these registry agreements with ICANN are signed before these domains become generally available, a few more steps remain, including delegation; controlled interruption, which deals with potential name collisions; completion of a Sunrise period; and finalization and approval of our launch plans. The failure to gain approval, if required, could delay a general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs.","I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 130.6 million, consisting of 115.6 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 2.7% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we added 0.59 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.2 million new gross registrations. In a few moments, George will discuss an update we intend to make to our definition of the domain name base, which will start with the first quarter of 2015.","In the third quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72% compared with 72.7% for the third quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.4%. This rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013.","As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and changes in registrar go-to-market strategies.","Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first-time renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions as well as other factors.","Net name additions during the fourth quarter came in below our expectations, primarily due to fewer gross additions. Some of the gross additions strength we saw during the third quarter, which was coming from emerging markets, including China, did not continue the same -- at the same growth rate during the fourth quarter.","Based on these factors and current trends, we are forecasting first quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1 million and 1.5 million names.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.","During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $256 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $142 million, up 9% from $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.6% compared to 53% in the same quarter a year ago.","GAAP net income totaled $65 million compared to $292 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.94 in the fourth quarter of last year.","Fourth quarter 2014 net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a change in estimates for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets in 2014.","As described, last year, fourth quarter 2013 GAAP results included tax benefits, pretax nonoperating gains and expenses, which collectively increased net income by approximately $218 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.45.","As of December 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $486 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally.","Total liabilities were $3 billion at the quarter end, down from $3.1 billion a year ago.","I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.","As mentioned, revenue totaled $256 million for the fourth quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. 2014 full year revenue was $1.010 billion up 4.7% from full year 2013 revenues. Deferred revenue at year-end 2014 totaled $890 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2013. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million compared with $101 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $106 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 59.4% compared to 56.9% in the same quarter of 2013.","Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin was 60.2%.","Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.70 last quarter.","Full year 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.72, a 13% increase over 2013. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2014 was a $77 million expense.","We had a weighted average diluted share count of 135.9 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 138.1 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.7 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 13.7 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of 3.7 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter.","Operating cash flow was $170 million for the fourth quarter compared to $168 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $147 million for the fourth quarter last year.","Full year 2014 operating cash flow was $601 million compared with $579 million for 2013.","Fourth quarter free cash flow was $159 million, including a use of $9 million in capital expenditures.","Free cash flow for 2014 was $568 million, including a net $6 million of excess tax benefits and a use of $39 million in capital expenditures.","With respect to taxes, we used a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share during 2014. As we continue to optimize our tax structure, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share going forward is 26%. As a result, we expect to use a 26% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2015 non-GAAP results.","Also, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to say stay well below our tax rate use for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.","As Jim mentioned, I want to note a change we'll be making to our domain name base definition and reporting starting next quarter.","Currently, we report our domain name base to you both on our website and during earnings each quarter. The domain name base includes the active zone, which is defined as the names that resolve in the zone plus the names that are requested to be not configured for use in the top-level domain zone filed by the registrant. Historically, there has also been an immaterial portion of names that we manage and for which we are paid that are not included in our domain name base definition. These names get removed from the active zone primarily by registrars when they place the name on hold status.","Over the last several years, the average amount of names in the on-hold status category has been approximately 400,000 names and the net change year-over-year has been very small.","While still immaterial, during 2014, we saw an increase in the amount of names registrars have placed on hold status, which appears to be a result of these registrars complying with the new mandated compliance mechanisms in ICANN's 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement or RAA.","In 2014, we saw an increase in domain names placed on hold status from roughly 394,000 names at the end of 2013 to about 870,000 at the end of 2014.","While the number of these names in total is not material to our overall domain name base of over 130.6 million domain names, as registrars use of this mechanism has increased, we believe it now makes sense to include these names when we report the number of domain names in the domain name base.","As we are paid for these on-hold names and they have always been included in our reported revenue and gross additions, starting with our first quarter 2015 report, we plan to amend our current definition of our domain name base to include these on-hold status names and we'll be consistent in our reporting of prior periods by also including these names for comparative purposes going forward.","Before our next earnings call, we intend to update the daily reporting on our website to included these names.","In the meantime, updates to the domain name base are still posted on our website per our current definition at least once per day allowing you to continue to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.","The Q1 net addition guidance Jim gave earlier of 1 million to 1.5 million net name additions is not affected by this new domain name base definition as our quarterly guidance is focused on gross additions and deletions.","With respect to full year 2015 guidance. Revenue for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $1.040 billion to $1.060 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is based on domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015.","Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 60% and 62%.","Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and includes the contingent interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures.","Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million.","Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2014. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, George. During the last year, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We continue to protect the business by providing more than 17 continuous years of 100% availability of the com and net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. Also, I want to highlight that this quarter marks the 30th anniversaries of both .com and .net. We're proud to be the registry operator of these 2 top-level domains, which are a key component of the Internet's infrastructure.","We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. While we continue to actively invest in the development of new products and services where we continue to make progress, we don't have an update at this time.","Finally, we have been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. During 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares, returning $867 million to shareholders, and repatriated $741 million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries.","We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple if I may. George, you mentioned the hold status names in your prepared remarks. Can you give us a better sense as to what exactly that means and the impact on the zone files? I just want to make sure that I understand that correctly when doing my daily tracking.","George E. Kilguss","Sure, I'd be happy to, Gray. As mentioned in our prepared remarks, names in an on-hold status have always been reported in our revenues and gross additions. So these are not new names. They just haven't been included in our domain name base definition. So as a result, they've not been included in the total 130.6 million name count. On-hold names are a simply management mechanism used primarily by registrars to place names into a hold status, which removes them from the active zone file and prevent them from resolving. The name, however, is still registered by the registrar regardless of the status. Now these names represent a very small and nonmaterial portion of the domain name base, approximately 400,000 at the start of 2014, and their totals have been relatively constant for many years. I'd also add, however, that registrars use this mechanism -- use of this mechanism has increased during 2014, and as a result, we feel it appropriate to amend our definition to include these names going forward. As mentioned at the end of 2014, the names classified with a hold designation totaled about 870,000, which was an increase of about 470,000 -- 475,000 in 2014, up from 394,000 at the end of 2013. Again, it's a very minor point, but we just want to provide the additional transparency and felt the definitional change would really help in this instance.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense, I think. And so I guess, like one day you'll include it in the zone files that we see in your website and it'll look like you added 870,000 names in one day or something like that, but the reality would just be it's a definitional change, is that correct?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, just the base is going up. And as I mentioned, this doesn't affect our guidance as we're trying to guide to gross name additions and deletions. It's just a base that's going up. We get paid for these names, they're in our revenue and it's a small amount, but we felt the additional transparency made sense as registrars' use of these things had increased over the past 12 months.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And last question, if I may. I know it's kind of tough to call out monthly trends in terms of domain name adds, but we noticed a fairly meaningful slowdown in December and then things really picked up significantly in January. I think you're tracking to, I think, it looks like 650,000 adds so far in the last 35 days. Can you just kind of give us a sense as to what happened there and what the main drivers are?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, sure. So I think what you're seeing in the first month in bit -- a little bit in 2015 really relates to the Chinese New Year. Last year, the new year started, I believe, January 31. This year, it doesn't start till February 19, so it's about 20 years -- 20 days late. And we typically see the activity slow a little bit about a week before the Chinese New Year. So we've just had a good constant demand for domains in the month-to-date period, but we expect it to fall off a little bit as the Chinese New Year kicks in later this month.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","George, Q4 operating margins came in lower than industry is expecting and operating margins for the year effectively came in at the low end of your guidance. Was there anything relating to fourth quarter expenses that you would call out?","George E. Kilguss","Yes. Sure, Gregg. So if you looked at our total non-GAAP operating expense, it actually was -- for the fourth quarter, actually it was down year-over-year, but it was up sequentially by about $3.4 million. And we saw that increase really come primarily in G&A. We saw that being up about $2.4 million and G&A was up in the quarter primarily because we had about $1 million of severance expense in the quarter. And then we have about another $1 million of, what I would call, seasonal fourth quarter expenses that hit us, some of which were related to higher consulting expenses as we approached the year-end. The other increase we had was in R&D, and as far as R&D goes, we saw a slight decrease in the amount of labor that we actually capitalized on the balance sheet. And as a result of that lower amount of capitalization, some of that flowed into the income statement and that was the majority of the increase in the R&D expense.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Jim, wanted to ask, just because we've seen sort of ongoing sluggishness with .net, if you had an updated perspective there. Do you see risk of a secular decline from new gTLDs? Or do think that .net will resume growth going forward?","D. James Bidzos","Well, .net is a well-established brand, it's 30 years old. It did dip below 15 million registrations, but it's back over that. I would just point out that, in 2014, .net had 3.6 million gross registrations. And as of the end of December, at the end of the year, that's roughly the same as the total number of registrations in all of the new gTLDs combined. So it's a strong brand, it's been around for 30 years, it's going to be around for the next 30 years. I mentioned on the last call and I think it's still true that there is some confusion with the .net is suffering from, that this -- the 400-plus new gTLDs that are out and available today are sort of bringing some confusion. There are hundreds more that are coming, so I think that will probably continue. But net is a strong brand, 30 years old, well-respected, 3.6 million gross adds last year, 800,000 adds last quarter, so it's going to be around for a while and it will do well.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And if I could just ask one, one last one, also on this topic and I appreciate the update earlier on the transliteration front. But just kind of more, if you had any broader thoughts, on new gTLDs and specifically their overall impact to VeriSign's financials going forward, that would be helpful.","D. James Bidzos","Well, I think a specific answer with respect to the financials, I think, is a bit difficult. But in general, I would like Pat to make some comments about new gTLDs. Pat?","Patrick S. Kane","So the new gTLDs, I think the story is still out on the success of them. If you take a look at the 400 -- the 400-plus TLDs that are in existence today, at the end of 2014, there were 3.7 million registrations in those 400-plus TLDs. But one of the things in terms of identifying whether they'll be successful or not is really what the renewal rate is and we're just now going to see the beginning of a renewal cycle for this new gTLDs. And the second thing that we take a look at is what does the DNS traffic look like. And so if you think about the com, net DNS base today, we do about 82 billion transactions a day and we don't have any idea what those same transactions would look like for the new gTLDs, but that would be another indicator of success. So it's still -- time will still tell.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You commented on some slowdown in the month of December in China then obviously you commented on, actually, China contributing to what was a strong start in January. When you kind of contemplated your guidance for domain names for this year and you kind of think about it, I guess, geographically, did anything sort of jump out to you as you kind of built this? Any sort of change that you've seen over the course of the year? Or as you contemplated 2015 or any kind of reversal of a trend that you may be did see, just any sort of color from a geographic perspective would be great on the guidance.","George E. Kilguss","Yes, sure, Phil, this is George. So as we talked about Q4, we did continue to see growth in emerging markets, but it just wasn't as robust as we had seen exiting Q3 and so that trend waned a little bit. But they still grew. I think, in general, I think by definition, emerging markets they have their ups and downs, they do have some volatility there in their definition of being emerging. But we're still seeing a lot of growth there. More specifically, we still see good activity in China, we still see good activity in India and in Asia Pac. We're still seeing very strong and good demand for the products there and that's where most of the growth is going on internationally. So the U.S. market is a little bit more tepid in regard to that.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just one quick follow-up question on the capitalization of R&D. You said it was a little lower this quarter, so therefore expense is higher. When you contemplated your margin guidance for '15 here, what kind of assumption did you make of sort of capitalization versus the levels that you saw in '14?","George E. Kilguss","We expect it to be similar to last year. But again, there are small movements. Fourth quarter I think was about 0.5 million, so it really depends on the projects that we're looking for, what stage those projects are in and if we actually have some products that are coming to market and we're actually developing new functionality, then we'll capitalize that further, the regulations in GAAP. But it really depends on the projects that we're working on, what stage those projects are in and we'll just treat it according to the GAAP regulations as to what get capitalized or not.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Ken Wong for Walter. So Jim, in terms -- Q1 being seasonally strongest quarter on domain add, just wondering what you guys are hearing or seeing from your registrar partners in terms of their approach to domains, in .com, in particular? And then also have you guys planned to do anything kind of unique to try to drive activity here?","D. James Bidzos","So first of all, with respect to what registrars may be doing differently. A couple of -- for the last couple of quarters at least, we talked about a shift in registrar marketing tactics where they were looking for increasing ARPU and then a shift back, which gave us some uplift over the last couple of quarters. So I think we continue to see that, which has helped us. As far as commenting on -- I'm sorry, not new gTLDs, but in terms of what we may do in promotion, we constantly run regular programs of promotion with the registrars. We use marketing programs to try to drive resources geographically and through other means. We did recently launch a contest for .com names and a number of other promotions that we're doing. We'll be doing a number of things through the year in recognition of the 30th anniversary of .com, in particular. But I think the best thing that we do is just simply highlight the brand and the widespread adoption of .com. I think if you watched the Super Bowl, for example, I think, pretty much everybody who advertised is branded .com. It's just a strong powerful brand and we do have the benefit of endorsements from every company that brands itself that way.","George E. Kilguss","We also try to move dollars around or invest heavily or more heavy in those markets that we think are growing faster and we think we can gain a competitive advantage. And so we take a careful analysis at all the markets we look at and we make very strong decisions and base decisions as to which markets to go into, to drive growth based on our budget expectations. And so clearly, we're investing internationally in a lot of the growth markets that we talked about.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And then, George, on the margin guidance, so kind of 60% to 62%, some decent uptick there even in the face of kind of slowing revenue. Which line items would you say you guys are going to be able to extract the most incremental margin from?","George E. Kilguss","So we don't give guidance, Ken, to each individual line item. When you take a look at our K, you'll see that our expectation is that they should be relatively consistent as a percent of revenue to what they are currently. But having said that, we're continuing to actively manage the business, and we always look for opportunities to continue to create efficiencies in the business. And as opportunities present themselves, we look to reinvest in the business as well. I don't think our strategic objectives have changed in the sense that we clearly have a desire to spend more in sales and marketing to drive top line growth and we clearly have a desire to invest in new products and technology that we think can drive positive returns for the company. And so we'll clearly look to invest in those areas and look for savings opportunities in other areas of the business to help fund those opportunities.","D. James Bidzos","And if I could just add something, sorry, to the answer I gave you earlier to your question about com, in particular. I'm just reminded that, earlier today, there was a new record sale in the aftermarket of a .com domain, 360.com sold for just under $17 million. And I think if you've seen -- if you look at the history of some of these aftermarket sales of .com, we had dailymail.com sell for GBP 1 million last year. Z.com sold in a private sale without auction for $6.8 million a few months ago to a Japanese company. We had a porno.com [ph] sold for $8.888 million and 360.com was sold to, I believe, a Chinese company, like I said, for $17 million, that's a new record. It's an incredible statement about the value of the .com brand. I think Daily Mail is a good example because here you don't have -- it's not a single character. It wasn't -- it was purchased because the company had made such an investment in developing its brand in .com that it simply wanted -- sorry, in the U.K. domain that it owned that it wanted the .com equivalent and I think that just simply represents the value of a .com name. 360.com for $17 million, a record that, I think, just says a lot about the value of the brand.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, clearly, the brand still remains kind of the top-selling position for domains. I originally thought there's going to be [indiscernible] that bought it and I quickly [indiscernible].","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the transliteration and new gTLD for your guys, the timing of those 11 transliterations, you mentioned the phases that you have to go through. Can you maybe put some general time ranges? Would you anticipate that these would be in the market more generally in the first half of the year or is it second half of the year?","Patrick S. Kane","So this is Pat, Sterling. I think it's really hard to tell because we are going to do -- we're going to ask for a modified Sunrise period and that will likely have to require approval from ICANN. We're not certain of that right now, but that's still going to take some time to get that and going as well as the Sunrise period and then the controlled interruption period for the identification of name collisions is also a long period. So it's hard to say right now as to what the exact time would be.","George E. Kilguss","And Sterling, this is George. As we mentioned last quarter, many of our back-end registry customers qualify as .Brand gTLDs and ICANN gave .Brand applicants until July of this year to finish the agreement process. So I think your back half is much more likely than the front half of the year.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And could you give us a sense of when those launch in the marketplace, what kind of marketing spend or investment generally are you anticipating to drive those new IDNs into the marketplace?","D. James Bidzos","I think that's tough to say, Sterling, this is Jim. The marketing plan that Pat alluded to that's a little different with different Sunrise period, during the Sunrise period, trademark holders are invited to come in and register their marked names prior to general availability. We have what you might call a much more brand-friendly sort of Sunrise in the sense that we are reserving the transliteration of the brands that are registered in .com. And so that implies that there'll be a different marketing approach. We'll simply be notifying existing registrants brands that the transliteration of their .com registration is available to them. So it's hard to say, it's not a traditional sort of a marketing effort. I think, in general, it means that we're not going to need to go out and promote the availability of these IDNs, although we'll certainly do some of that because people are free to register whatever they like in them. But the brand holders who are registered in .com have their brand name reserved for them in the IDNs. They're protected against somebody else registering a name who doesn't own that name. But it's an opportunity for them to have their brand name in the native language script of countries that they operate in. So I think you can see the obvious benefits of that. Putting a price tag on that marketing effort, I think, is - it's just kind of too early to say what it will be. But it'll be focused. It'll be more focused because it's quite targeted. It's unique, I think, as far as any TLD that's ever been launched.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","In terms of -- you talked about putting -- registrars putting the names on hold. Why do registrars put names on hold?","D. James Bidzos","Pat, you want to go ahead?","Patrick S. Kane","So there are several reasons. One of the most common is that you will get a court order that would ask to put something on hold while it's in dispute. People will also have domains that they don't want to have in the general zone, so that they can have the name registered, but not able to resolve. It may be something detrimental to their corporate brand and they don't want it to be out there. And then the one that we've seen most recently is the 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement requires registrars to put on hold domain names that they cannot validate the who-is information. And so that's where we've seen the largest trend these days in terms of what the growth is in those particular hold names. Now once they do validate the who-is data, those names will come out of the hold status and then, of course, be active at that point in time.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, let me just let me just add a couple of quick comments to that. If you're familiar with the so-called dark domains, these are the nonconfigured names where the registrant does not want it to resolve, for example, something that is not flattering about a corporate name. A corporation may defensively register that and they simply don't want it to resolve. We get paid for it, but it doesn't appear in the act -- it does not appear in the active zone. You can think of these hold names, we're going to treat them all together with these dark domains very similarly. So we'll get paid for them, but you'll see them reported in our domain name base, they'll be counted in there. The other thing is that George had mentioned this new 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement. This is the new agreement that the registrars signed with ICANN that they operate under. Now the number of accredited registrars is, I think, closer to 1,500 today where it was 900 some years ago. So I think -- I hope what we're seeing here, just to keep everything simple, is that all of them have pretty much signed this during 2014. And I think almost all of the registrars have signed it, a large number of them. So I think there's just this initial sort of compliance effort. Pat mentioned that they have to collect who-is data. This also means that some registrars that do not have direct distribution models, who actually sell indirectly through distributions, may find it a little more difficult or may find that it takes more time to collect accurate who-is data. And so these names will get put on hold while they go about doing that and then eventually they come off hold and then they're up here in the active zone. So that's sort of the activity that goes on. But if you understand how dark domains have worked and been counted, these are just like that. You can now think of these names on hold just like that.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just real quickly, George, do you -- can you remind me, do you sell globally in U.S. dollars?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, for com and net, the majority of our products we sell in U.S. dollars. So if you're referring to the FX impact in the traditional sense, we don't expect that to have an immediate or impact in our 2015 revenue. That being said, for some non-U.S. buyers of domain names, the strength of the U.S. dollar could create a perceived price increase, which could have an impact on demand. But while the strength of the U.S. dollar may be having some effect on demand, we really haven't seen that in any of our numbers, so it hasn't really been an impact for us to date.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. And just to go back and you may have already given this in the past, but the renewal rates today lower than they were a year ago, 2 years ago. Is that true in every country? Or are some countries more pronounced than others?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, renewal rates vary by country. Typically, in the more mature markets, the renewal rates are higher. In some of the emerging rates, the renewal rates tend to be a little bit lower.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Right. But my question is change. If we look at markets a year ago and today, which have seen the most change?","George E. Kilguss","So we don't break it out by market. I mean, if you -- and if you want to talk about change, I mean, the first-time renewal rate at the end of 2013 was about 52.8% and the first-time renewal rate did come down to about 50.7% for the full year 2014. Previous-renewed rates were very consistent at about 82%. And so we did see some of the first-time renewal rates come down and I think more of that is a function of the growth we're seeing in China, which has typically lower first-time renewal rate than the U.S., which is our largest market now. Again, that's an emerging market. As those markets mature, I would expect those renewal rates to improve, but it's a large market that's growing and is still emerging. And so it's just becoming a larger portion of the base and so you get a weighted average effect on the first-time renewal rate.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. David Atchley for any final remarks or comments.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator.

Please go ahead, sir.","David Atchley","Thank you operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's second-quarter 2016 earnings call.","With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from the investor relations section of our VeriSign.com website. There you will also find our second-quarter 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results and our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.","The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid first half of 2016 for VeriSign. Second-quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.","We reported revenue of $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $161 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the second quarter, and added 0.78 million net new names, ending with 143.2 million common net domain names in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong, with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.","As a part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business, and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign had been working on the Root Zone maintainer services agreement, and the .com registry agreement extension amendment. At the end of June, ICANN posted the RZMA for public review and the .com registry agreement amendment for public comment, after which our respective Boards of Directors will be asked to approve the agreements. After this, the .com RA extension amendment, which extends the term of the RA until November 30, 2024, will be sent to NTIA for review and approval, according to their processes.","I'll comment now on second-quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.2 million, consisting of 127.5 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.3% year-over-year.","In the first quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 74.4%, compared with 73.4% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2016 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2015.","As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second quarter, as we had anticipated, activity from registrars in China normalized.","Also, as discussed during the last two quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a larger than normal percentage of first-time renewing names, as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth-quarter deletions to be elevated.","Accordingly, as we stated the last two quarters, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the third-quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of 0.5 million, and between 0.5 million and 1.0 million names, and we are now forecasting full-year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2%.","Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2017, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $7.46 to $8.20. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and up 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the US, and 42% was from international customers.","GAAP operating income in the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 18.3% from $149 million in the second quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 61.5%, compared to 56.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $113 million, compared to $93 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.70 for the second quarter last year.","As of June 30, 2016, the Company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion, and total liabilities of $3.4 billion. Assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $609 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.","I'll now review some additional second-quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full-year guidance.","Second-quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, as compared to the $103 million in the first quarter of 2016, and $102 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in expenses is primarily a result of seasonally lower employer payroll tax withholdings in the quarter.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.4%, compared to 61.3% in the same quarter of 2015. The improved margin performance in the quarter was aided by our strong net add performance in the first quarter, and the timing of some sales and marketing expenditures being moved to the second half of the year.","Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 130.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the second quarter of 2015, and $0.85 last quarter, based on 133.3 million and 131.6 million weighted average diluted shares respectively.","Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.9 million shares, based on the average share price during the second quarter, compared with 17 million for the same quarter in 2015, and 21.1 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first-quarter 2016 repurchase activity, and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter.","Both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $161 million, compared with $175 million and $171 million respectively for the second quarter last year. With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.130 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6.5% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our current outlook and our updated expectation of full-year 2016 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2%.","Full-year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million.","Cash taxes for the year are also still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million, due to our domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. In summary, the Company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Bidzos","Thank you, George. In closing, during the second quarter, we continued to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value to our shareholders.","Since the start of this quarter, the Company achieved two important milestones. First, we marked 19 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people, and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more important.","Second, we were informed earlier this month by the Chinese government that we are now licensed to provide domain name registry services for .com and .net in the PRC. We believe that .com and .net are the first non-China based registries to be fully licensed in China.","We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We will now take your questions, and operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Thanks. One question for George, and then for Jim. George, on the OpEx, when you did, looks like it was pretty constrained in the first half of the year, you mentioned some marketing programs. Is that typical with what you've done in past years?","It doesn't seem like they've really stepped down necessarily the margins in the second half, and I'm wondering how this year might be different in terms of what you're driving in the business.","George Kilguss","Sure, Walter. As you mentioned, if you look at our marketing expenses, sales and marketing expenses, they were actually flat sequentially, but they were down year-over-year by about $4 million. There are a number of programs that we run, some that we direct specifically that we take a look at, others that -- programs that we open up to registrars to submit programs to us.","As we evaluate some of those programs that come in for us, clearly we're looking at those to see if it's going to have the right impact for our business, and if it's going to generate positive returns for us.","Sometimes some of those programs that get submitted are not that attractive for us, and so we look to solicit additional proposals from registrars, as well as redirecting some of our programs. Depending on what's going on around the globe, as you might expect, there's a number of geopolitical things happening, and so we take those and other factors into place.","I don't think there's anything unique here, other than we do have some programs that we did not execute on in the second half of -- the first half of the year, and we expect to execute on those in the second half of the year. So we're expecting our sales and marketing expense to increase in the second half of the year.","Walter Pritchard","And then for Jim, on the IDNs, I know that Korea and Japan have rolled out, I think we're pretty early still in the process, but would love to hear any update on registration volumes, how we should maybe look at those in terms of the ramp of volumes versus what we see in other gTLDs, and any sort of update on that process.","Jim Bidzos","Sure, I'll let Todd give you a little color on the progress of our IDNs. I'll just say upfront that remember that we're roughly six months into our IDN program. We started in Japan. It was the very first one.","We're learning from that. We're working with partners and introducing new products. There are some infrastructure challenges, and that there are a lot of Internet applications that don't fully support IDNs, so there's some things that are continuing to develop. We try to strike a balance between adoption, growth and revenue.","So there are a lot of factors that go into this. It's a little bit early. I don't think we're going to be able to give you a lot of detail, but Todd, if you want to add anything to that?","Todd Strubbe","Not a lot of detail. Just we are launched in Japan, and we are in general availability. We launched in Korea earlier with two IDNs, and we're in our limited release phase there, and we'll go into general availability on August 30. We don't publish our zone there, but you can see the stats on places like nTLDstats.com.","Walter Pritchard","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from with Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Matt Broome","Thanks very much. This is Matt Broome on for Gregg. So you had very little zone growth in the month of July. Can you walk through why the net add activities have been a lot weaker than what we usually see, as well as what gives you the confidence that things will pick up over the rest of the quarter?","Jim Bidzos","Sure. As you point out, July we've had I think about 133,000 adds quarter to date so far. It's not that different from last year. We typically, when we look at the third quarter results we expect to pick up typically more in the latter half of the quarter.","That tends to be a trend that we've seen historically, at least. But right now, if you were to straight line the net adds that we've had, you'd come to about 453,000. Clearly, we're expecting that to pick up right around the quarter, just based on seasonal trends we've seen previously.","Matt Broome","Okay. Great. Out of the 780,000 net adds in Q2, roughly I guess how much of that came from China?","Jim Bidzos","We don't break out our net adds by country. China continued to perform well for us this year, but so did the US, which is clearly our largest market, and EMEA continued to perform well for us as well.","Matt Broome","Okay. And then just one last one, if you could -- well, what's the latest I guess on timing around the ICANN contract extension for .com? That's it from me. Thanks.","Jim Bidzos","Sure. The .com extension amendment to our registry agreement is out for comment. That period ends in -- on August 12. After that, the Root Zone maintainer agreement and the .com extension contract both will be -- need to be approved by VeriSign's Board of Directors and ICANN's Board of Directors.","After that, they'll be given to NTIA for approval according to NTIA's processes. The only firm date I can give you at this point is the close of the comment period on August 12, and then it's a series of approvals following that.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we move next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Yes thanks. Hi guys. Just following on that line of questions, I frequently get the question as whether, as part of this process or maybe soon thereafter, would you revisit the pricing situation with the Department of Commerce and have the market study done again, or is that really going to be thought of as separate and maybe sometime down the road?","Todd Strubbe","Sterling, I assume you're talking about the opportunity available to the Company to pursue some review of our pricing?","Sterling Auty","Correct.","Todd Strubbe","That's what you're talking about? Yes, unrelated to the .com extension, unrelated to the Root Zone maintainer agreement. I really can't comment on when we would do that. I would say what I've said before in the past, that I believe that there is some data that's trending favorably for us, in that ICANN has now crossed over 1,000 new gTLDs delegated to the root.","I'm trying not to be too understated, but more than ample consumer choice for new gTLDs for consumers to choose from, and many of these TLDs are priced higher than .com. That data is helpful, but I really can't comment on when we might do that. I think there are a lot of factors we'd consider, and there's a process that we'd follow, but I'm not able to give you any information about exactly when we might do that.","Sterling Auty","Okay. That's fair. And then on the talk of the marketing programs that appear to be shifting to the second half, if I'm not mistaken, I think we were in a similar situation last year, and the year before. What is the drivers behind the timing of it? And can you remind us, did you end up spending those programs in the back half in each of the last two years, or in some cases, would you potentially decide not to spend that money?","George Kilguss","Well, I think in general, Sterling, look, if we can find marketing programs that generate positive rates of return for us and drive shareholder growth, I want to spend as much money in sales and marketing to accomplish that. Clearly, as we get a number of proposals, we offer these programs open to every single registrar, and so they're allowed to submit them. We have to evaluate them.","So we clearly want to make sure that the ones that we're pursuing and accepting meet certain financial criteria. To some degree, it really depends on the proposals that are being submitted to us. Others we direct, as I mentioned to an earlier caller, we're taking a variety of things into consideration.","We're marketing globally, we're looking at certain markets, and there are clearly are things that happen, whether it be, I don't know, a Brexit, or whether it be something that goes on in Turkey or other areas, we may choose to delay a program, or because of other factors outside of our control. So there's a variety of things that we take into consideration.","Last year we did spend more money. We did spend money in the second half of the year. But again, there's a variety of factors that come to lumpiness. Our intention is to invest dollars into the market that will drive incremental profitable growth for the business. So, hopefully that answers your question.","Sterling Auty","Yes, it does. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our last question from -- our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven Ashley","Thank you very much. I think I'd just like to ask the first question on the renewal rates, which have improved here, especially in the first quarter, but still at a good level here. Is that just mix of first-time renewals being lower as a percentage of total, or have you seen any change in first-time renewal rates there? Thank you.","George Kilguss","Yes, thanks for the question. So you're correct, our renewal rates are up about 1% year-over-year, our preliminary renewal rate in the quarter is 73.7%, as Jim mentioned, up from 72%. The improvement we're seeing is primarily in the previously renewed rate. That's up about 80 basis points year-over-year from about 82.7% a year ago to 83.5% this year.","And that improvement in the previously renewed rate, we're seeing that both in U.S. and international markets. On our first time renewal rate, it's also up slightly, but we're primarily seeing that improvement in the U.S. market. On average, that first-time renewal rate is still around the 50% range, though.","Steven Ashley","Okay. Gross margins, 83.6%. I think that's the highest number we may have ever seen. What is contributing to that improvement? Is that sustainable?","George Kilguss","Again, Steve, we look to manage all our expenses, not particularly a particular line item -- in a particular line item. I mean, we've also had slightly lower registration fees in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So because there tends to be more new names in the first quarter, we tend to have higher registration fees for ICANN, than we have in the second quarter.","So it's a little seasonal dip there from that. But we continue to look at our expenses across the board, add resources where we feel it's appropriate, but in total, we're really focused on that total non-GAAP operating expense as a key metric that we're looking to manage.","Steven Ashley","And in terms of the range of outcomes we could see from the Department of Commerce, if we get through the Board approval of VeriSign, if we get through the Board approval of ICANN, if this is sent to the Department of Commerce for approval, is the range of outcomes either thumbs up or thumbs down, or could they separate the two, and say we're willing to do the Root Zone but .com we want back on the old schedule? I'm just wondering if you have any color around that.","Jim Bidzos","The fundamental rationale for the two agreements is addressing the priority, as called for by NTIA of security and stability in the Root Zone. And that's the reason that the .com agreement is being extended, so that it can be coterminous with the Root Zone maintainer agreement. The two agreements are related in that sense.","So hopefully that helps you understand that the two agreements are really part of an effort to provide security and stability during this transition process of Root Zone oversight from NTIA to ICANN. I think in that sense, you view them as part of an effort to assure security and stability during a transition process.","Steven Ashley","Thank you.","Jim Bidzos","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our last question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.","Priya Parasuraman","This is actually Priya Parasuraman for Gray. Just a quick one from me. Could you talk about what's going on in China and whether you expect things to normalize there, and does the fact that you've been licensed change anything?","George Kilguss","Sure, Priya. As we talked about last quarter, we did expect the China volumes to normalize and at least in the second quarter, they absolutely did normalize for us. So at least what we're currently seeing is those are at much more normal levels. As far as the license agreement, I don't really -- I don't have any particular expectations.","We've always operated in China. We've done well there. I think our brand is quite strong there. I don't really have any change of expectation, just related to the license, to how we perform. Anything you want to add, Jim?","Jim Bidzos","Yes, I think the license is important, but we have been operating with the approval of the Chinese government for a period of time, as they introduce new processes for their local registrars to follow. There was a new licensing regime that was announced some time ago.","We've been in that process for a period of time, and as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we now are the -- as far as we know, the first registries, .com and .net to be approved. So we are licensed for those registries to operate in China, which is important, although we did expect that process would yield the result that it did.","So I don't see any interruption in the availability of our products and their operation in China, so I think it's certainly an important milestone for us, but one that we've been working with the Chinese government on for a period of time. That in and of itself I don't expect to change anything from the registrant point of view. It just simply enables to registrars to comply with local law.","Priya Parasuraman","Thank you.","Jim Bidzos","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Atchley, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.","Operator","This does conclude our presentation.

Thank you for joining us on VeriSign's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. I'm David Atchley, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. I'm here today with Jim Bidzos,  Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Naming Services.","Please note that this call and accompanying slide presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.verisigninc.com.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. As you will have seen from the press release, we have some important news about the status of the renewal of the .com agreement. I'll begin with the news on the .com renewal and then George and I will cover the key highlights for the quarter, and then we'll turn to your questions.","By terms in an agreement between the Department of Commerce and VeriSign called the Cooperative Agreement, we submitted our agreement with ICANN, to service the authoritative registry operator for the .com registry to the Commerce Department for its review on June 26, 2012. As a result of communications beginning in October 2012 with the Commerce Department, we learned that the Commerce Department was conducting a review of pricing with the Department of Justice. We believe this review, which we are participating in, may continue beyond November 30, 2012, in which case a 6-month extension of the .com registry agreement would become effective. We want to emphasize that nothing has happened that changes the risk of our running .com. We expect to continue to be the registry operator of .com. Our record on security and stability has been acknowledged by the Commerce Department. We are involved in discussions with the Commerce and Justice Departments as they review the pricing terms in the .com renewal agreement. These discussions are ongoing and could extend beyond November 30. We will work diligently with them through the review process. Because of our discussions on this matter are ongoing, I'm not going to go into more detail. We will, however, update you when appropriate regarding new information. I'll now review the key highlights of the third quarter.","The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign and we continue to see benefits from our restructuring focus and discipline. In Naming, we processed 7.8 million new registrations in the third quarter while adding 1.37 million .net names, finishing the quarter with 119.9 million names in the domain name base.","Our balance sheet remains strong, with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $77 million. Through the first 3 quarters of 2012, we have repurchased approximately 5.4 million shares for $221 million and we have approximately $610 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no expiration.","We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com equaled 105 million names, while .net equaled 14.9 million names. The total base of registered names in .com and .net was 119.9 million at the end of September. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter.","In the third quarter, we added 1.37 million .net names to the domain name base and we processed 7.8 million new registrations, down 1% compared with the same period a year ago.","In the second quarter of 2012, the overall renewal rate was 72.9%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2012 will be approximately 72.3%. This rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the third quarter of 2011.","Net number of names added to the domain base during the third quarter were below our guidance, primarily driven by 2 factors. First, the continuing effects of changes in search algorithms we discussed during last quarter. Search engine adjustments made over the past several months continue to affect the economics which drive domain monetization. As noted in our last earnings call, we have seen these search engine changes in the past, which have impacted our first time renewing names and our overall renewal rates. Historically, the domain monetization community has adjusted to such changes over several quarters. We have no way of knowing how long they'll be impacted by the changes being made in the current environment, but we are now experiencing the second quarter of these effects.","Secondly, we are seeing some signs suggesting that macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe, are also leading to softer international renewal rates. Given these 2 factors, we expect the fourth quarter .net names added to the base to be between 0.9 million and 1.3 million names.","As discussed on the last call, we post updates to the zone on our website at least once per day. With this increased transparency, you'll be able to track how the zone is growing throughout the fourth quarter.","Our NIA business continues to exhibit good year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to focus our efforts to scale the NIA business to achieve quality of revenue and stable growth while better aligning expenses with revenue. Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, George Kilguss.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, the company generated revenue of $224 million, up 13% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially. During the quarter, the company delivered GAAP operating income of $116 million, up 30% from $89 million in the third quarter of 2011. GAAP operating margin in the quarter also improved to 51.9% compared to 45.2% in the comparable quarter a year ago, which was as a result of both top line growth and stable costs during the quarter.","GAAP net income totaled $78 million compared to $59 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.47 in the quarter on a GAAP basis. As Jim mentioned, our balance sheet remains strong. As of September 30, 2012, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was in cash and marketable securities. Of the $1.5 billion, approximately $250 million was domestic with the remainder held overseas.","Total liabilities remained at approximately $2 billion as of the third quarter, up from $1.9 billion at year end.","As you may have noticed, during the latter part of the third quarter, the stock price exceeded the convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means holders of the convertible debentures have the option of converting them into common stock during the fourth quarter. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures, the related embedded derivatives and the deferred tax liability were reclassified from long-term liabilities to current liabilities, while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from long-term assets to current assets as of September 30, 2012.","Total debt on the balance sheet was $703 million at quarter end, consisting of $100 million of outstandings drawn under the $200 million credit facility and the $603 million present value of the $1.2 billion in convertible debentures.","The convertible debentures continue to be accreted onto our balance sheet up to its $1.25 billion par value over its 25-year remaining term.","I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2012 full year guidance.","As mentioned, revenue totaled $224 million for the third quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. Revenue from international sources grew 14.7% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and slightly faster than our domestic source revenue, which grew 12.7% for the same comparative period. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $809 million, an $80 million increase from year end.","Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million and was down 1% sequentially.","G&A operating expenses increased in the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in legal and related expenses of $3.9 million due to efforts supporting the Department of Commerce review of our renewal of .com Registry Agreement with ICANN and the legal advice related to ICANN's new gTLD program. These increased expenses were expected as part of the .com renewal process and the new gTLD program, and were offset by lower sales and marketing expense in the quarter.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter continued to expand and totaled 56.4% compared to 54% in the second quarter of 2012. Our third quarter operating margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and our ability to obtain operational efficiencies to help offset rising cost, which allowed us to keep total expenses in line with the previous quarter. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business model and other ways to benefit our operating margin.","Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $84 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter of 2011 and $0.45 last quarter.","With respect to taxes, as stated on our last earnings call, starting from the third quarter, we are using a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. We continue to use the 30% non-GAAP tax rate for prior periods presented. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $45 million.","We had a weighted average diluted share count of 166.6 million shares in the third quarter compared to 164.2 million shares in the second quarter of this year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 9.2 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter, an increase of 3.6 million shares from the second quarter. This increase was partially offset by the full impact of Q2 share repurchase activity and the weighted impact of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the quarter.","Operating cash flow was $122 million for the third quarter, down from $135 million in the second quarter of this year and up compared to $108 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $117 million for the third quarter of 2012, including $9 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and excluding $14 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.","With respect to guidance, we now think revenues for 2012 should be in the range of $870 million to $875 million, representing an annual growth rate of about 13%. We gave a range of $870 million to $880 million on the last call.","Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be at least 55%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of approximately $39 million for 2012, and capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be slightly lower and fall between 6% to 7% of revenue. We gave a range of 6% to 8% on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business and increased operating efficiencies in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, we continue to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. Before opening the call to your questions, I would like to give you a progress update on our execution against the strategic framework we shared with you during our last call. Our strategic framework is how we're thinking about the business across 4 areas of focus that we believe will drive value creation. These 4 areas are to protect, grow, innovate and manage the business effectively.","First, we protect the business by providing unparalleled registry services and network performance while acting as responsible stewards for the infrastructure which we operate. As discussed earlier, we will continue to work with the Department of Commerce towards the renewal of our .com agreement.","Second, with respect to growth, as you may have noticed, ICANN has given updates to its timeline and process for their new gTLD program. As you may recall, 12 of our 14 applications were for IDN versions of .com and .net.","Third, as evidenced by our continued filing of patent applications, we are focused on innovation and value creation through new services that we can build around the Domain Name System.","And fourth, we believe in managing the business responsibly from a financial perspective. We believe that continuing to deliver on these 4 areas, with the right balance, should provide unparalleled performance for our customers, businesses and consumers that rely on our critical infrastructure as well as creating value for our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Appreciating there may not be a lot you could say, just wondering is there anything else you could give us in terms of this process going forward here with DOC and DOJ and particularly, what type of information have they asked you for at this point?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, Walter, this is Jim. We're in that process so it would really be inappropriate to say anything about the process itself. But let me just reiterate that the status of our ability to operate .com is not an issue here. The performance, in terms of security and stability, is not an issue. As you recall, in the Cooperative Agreement, the Commerce Department gives its consent to what we negotiated with ICANN and it approves that agreement based on the public interest, which is defined as security and stability and registry services on reasonable prices, terms and conditions. It consults with other agencies, as necessary, in its review. That's the process we're in. We're engaged with them. There is a possibility that it will not be complete by November 30, as we said in our press release and as we've reiterated here. And I wish I could tell you more but I think that's probably the appropriate amount of information given that we're in the process. As soon as we can, we'll share more information with you.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just, George, did you give us a number of names up for renewal or if not, could you give us that number?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, I'd be happy to, Walter. The number of names up for renewal in the fourth quarter is 24 million names.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm curious if the DOT gave an indication. Are they reviewing the level of current pricing or the price increases as indicated in the new contract that's proposed?","D. James Bidzos","This is Jim again. Well, they have a review process, they have the right to review and that's what they're doing. We're in that process. I think to provide any level of detail, it's inappropriate. The process isn't complete. I can only tell you that we're participating in it. We'd like it to be done by November 30, but it is possible that it will extend beyond that. And until we're ready to tell you more, I think that's probably all the information we can give you at this point.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And one follow-up on the actual business. The number of new names processed was actually down, you mentioned the macroeconomic. Is there any particular countries in Europe or can you also talk through any programs that you may have done in the quarter or plan to do to try to invigorate the new name adoption?","George E. Kilguss","Sterling, this is George. In the quarter, we absolutely saw that -- well, obviously, .net names are a function of both gross additions, less the deleting names and we took a look at the additions in the quarter, they total about $7.8 million as compared to about 7.9 million names in the last year. So it was down about 1% in that comparative period and when you look at the names deleting out of the zone, we saw those deletions be about 6.4 million this quarter versus about 5.9 million a year ago. So we absolutely have seen an increase in deletions. And when we look at those deletions, we're seeing an increase in them in the international markets. And so our renewal rates, internationally, have come down a little bit. We are still doing more analysis on it, we don't have it by country, but it just seems to be related to the European economy in general is where we're seeing the deletes increase year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","This is Harris Higher [ph] on behalf of Phil Winslow. We were hoping you could comment a little bit on international domain names and expectations going forward into 2013?","Patrick S. Kane","This is Pat, Harris. We take a look at the growth opportunities for international domain names, as George said previously, we do see a little bit of drawdown in the European markets. However, we do continue to see growth in India and China and other Asia-Pac countries. And so I think that when you take a look at what our 2013 focus will be in terms of growth opportunities, it really will be China and India. So I think there's good growth coming from those areas.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So back to the Department of Commerce. Has the Department of Justice ever been involved with reviewing a contract before in the past?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, this is Jim. They were involved back in 2006 when the Cooperative Agreement was put together and the associated amendment. The Commerce Department is the party with which VeriSign has entered into the Cooperative Agreement, and the Commerce Department has the responsibility for review and the obligations to VeriSign to act in the public interest against the 2 standards in the agreement, security and stability and registry services. It consults with other government agencies. The Justice Department was involved back in 2006, so this is not the first time that they've been involved.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And would you care to handicap the probability of the pricing terms changing possibly before the agreement is adopted?","D. James Bidzos","I think given the process and where it is right now, I think it would be -- well, under most circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to do that as much as I may want to. But no, I can't do that. At this point I think given the process which is really the Commerce Department's process, although we are involved in it, that would be inappropriate for me to comment on.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just lastly, you've mentioned the fact that Google had tweaked the search engine. Last quarter, you called that out for us. I'm just trying to understand exactly, maybe get more color on what that means. Does that simply mean that certain sites on Google search simply are not ranked high enough? And the reason I ask that is it seems that a lot of these domainer sites really are not got to through Google, they mostly are got to through native search. So trying to understand a little bit more color on what's happening and the impact on those sites.","Patrick S. Kane","This is Pat. So basically, what happens with -- what they're trying to attempt to do is to push those search results down further in the rankings. And so therefore, Google is trying to push that down to increase -- or any algorithm search engine is trying to increase their own revenue. So basically, these domains end up being further down in the search results and those are clicked on less. I mean that's it's -- basically, that's the basics.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo.","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So I hate to belabor the issue but just sticking with the DOC, maybe could you just state your case for why you think the pricing for the .com contract should remain unchanged? And then, what do you say to proponents that would potentially argue that you are over earning on the contracts?","D. James Bidzos","Let's see, this is Jim. I think the first question goes to process and it's probably inappropriate for me to comment on. Your second question about -- is your question about our earnings?","Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No. If someone looks at your operating margins and says you guys have like a 55% operating margin and a very good business and you're potentially earning too much on the .com contract, what do you say to them to counter that argument?","D. James Bidzos","I think most of what I would say probably falls under the process that we're currently in. But I would say to you that as we say, as we mentioned earlier during the call, as I talked about and as George talked about, it is, to a large extent, the efficiencies that we see in the business, I think, are due to the fact that we've been running the business more efficiently. Recall of course, that we've just completed a major 5-year restructuring going from over 5,000 employees to about 1,000, shedding numerous non-core businesses, having cash that is a result of proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses, a long-term 5-year divestiture program, and our focus on managing the business efficiently and on operating discipline and on being very focused. So I would say that I think we've done a very good job over the last 5 years of optimizing the business, running it very efficiently, understanding where we are. 2011 was the first year that we really operated on a full year basis as sort of the new VeriSign, focused on one particular business, that being the Registry Services business. Prior to that, we were always something else. It wasn't until past the midpoint of 2010 that we actually completed the sale of the Authentication business. So we've just come off in 2011 and now in 2012, the first year and second year of actually being a focused registry business and it takes some time to adjust to that and as we've adjusted, we've discovered efficiencies because we focus on it. We operate the business efficiently, we target efficient operation. Generally, the result of that is improving margins. So I would say that, that's a very important part of VeriSign's margin story and its efficient business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I'll move past the DOC questions. I know you're obviously restricted, Jim, in terms of what you can say from here, but I do want to follow up on an earlier question. There's been a lot of talk around lower renewal rates due to the search algo changes and then also, macro issues related to Europe, but the fact that new name registrations did fall slightly year-over-year, wondering if you had any more insight into that. Is that something that was restricted to Europe or did you see any of that in the U.S. or some other regions as well?","D. James Bidzos","This is Jim. Let me make a couple of comments to address that question, then I'll let George and Pat comment as appropriate here. First of all, you'll recall that back in 2009, that was really the first time that we saw a major change in search algorithms that targeted the monetization players who were essentially trying to exploit the search engine algorithm to get themselves placed higher in results so that they could drive traffic and monetize it themselves. We saw that over a period of time, after those changes, there was some recovery and the monetization community adapted to it. We saw in 2012, changes which affected Q2, which we've discussed with you before. I think there is a more serious effort by the search engine algorithm players here to sort of clean up search results and improve the quality, as Pat said, to drive some of the monetization community down further. So we discussed in the last call, the Panda and Penguin programs, for example, that Google utilized where they were targeting content farms, they were targeting keyword stuffers and now they're also targeting exact name matches, which typically are monetization names often. So for example, if you search for purple blue widgets, and purplebluewidgets.com happens to be a registered domain, that in the past, would've been likely to score very high in the search results. However, if the search engine algorithm is tweaked to go out and consider other factors, the age of the domain, how many pages are on it, how fresh is some of the content and give it a score, essentially, on how likely it is that it's truly quality content that the searcher might be interested in versus something that had been set up for monetization purposes, I think the search engine algorithms are essentially targeting that kind of traffic to get it out. You'll also recall that back in 2009, we said that roughly 9% of the zone, as far as we could tell, were so-called advertising names. We're not at a point right now to tell you exactly what that number is today. But I think there might be some developments where other domains have sort of -- other TLDs have targeted in a sense, this monetization community and possibly, some of those names may have been drawn away over the years and moved to other areas, which is, in a sense, a good thing because it means that these changes, while they are making a difference and I know you see that every day, we do too, of course, and while it may take longer to recover depending on how intense and how sustained these campaigns are, the fact is that there may be fewer of these names to work on in .com because of the move to other TLDs. I know Pat watches this very, very closely and George does as well so I'll invite them to comment.","Patrick S. Kane","This is Pat. So one of the types of models that Jim is referring to is the one that .tk runs. And so, .tk basically gives away domain registrations for a set of criteria which includes an ad revenue share. So we believe that there's some data that shows that people are using or going to that type of model and registering domains in .tk to drive pure registration without the initial investment that was required within a .com or a .net registration. Those domain names will be up for a while, they develop those names and then the .tk registry itself can take those names back if certain objectives aren't made with the registrar under the domain name, and therefore, continues to be a registration that is run by the registry operator itself.","George E. Kilguss","And only thing I would add, Gregg, is that if you look back historically, we do have a little bit of seasonality in the third quarter. Typically, Q1 and Q2 are always a little heavier from a gross registration perspective than Q3 and Q4 are. This particular year in 2012, we actually had an extraordinary strong Q1 and Q2 and so while numerically, decline looks a little steeper in Q3, Q3 this year is falling relatively on top of last year's Q3 gross adds from that perspective.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ed Maguire with CLSA.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just comment on the upside to the operating margin. Were there any unusual factors that led you to see incremental cost savings?","George E. Kilguss","So Ed, this is George Kilguss. So in the quarter in general, our total operating costs stayed relatively level with last quarter. We had some movements in the pieces, we saw general and administrative expenses increase by about $3.9 million related to some of the legal costs we had with the DOC and the new gTLD program. And they were offset by some lower spend in our sales and marketing. As you may have known, we had a transition in our leadership and our marketing area, and so we had some underspend in that area, at least in the third quarter. But we at least managed those costs and they offset one another in the quarter. So we, again, look for efficiencies but for example, in the fourth quarter, which we talked about, we will have a change in the ICANN registration fees. Those will go on a more variable basis, instead of a fixed basis. So they'll go up to about $0.25 per name. So starting December 1, we'll see the fees paid to ICANN increase in cost of about $750,000 a month. So costs do vary, but we're doing our best to try to offset those increased costs with efficiencies from the long tail of the restructuring.","D. James Bidzos","If I can just add to that, I agree entirely with what George said, I just feel that I should add the caveat, of course, as you know, we've just come off the restructuring, we've optimized, we've run the business much more efficiently, but I'm sure a lot of you have seen in the news recently, the number of DDoS attacks against financial institutions. Some of them sustained, some of them still continuing today, more sophisticated, larger in scale. I would just say that given the nature and growth of these attacks, obviously, we don't budget for the kinds of things that we might need to do to adapt as some of these attacks grow but it is a fact that you're seeing playing out in today's headlines every day, the kind of attacks against infrastructure, against targets for political or other reasons by nation states, at least, it's alleged in some cases. So the caveat is while we run the business very efficiently, events could of course, always dictate that we do need to make capital investments in order to stay ahead of the curve. That's how we got to where we are today with the uptime record that we have. Without getting into the process that we're in with DOC and DOJ, the question earlier about what sort of VeriSign's position is. I mean, I would just simply point out that VeriSign has an unparalleled record of performance in the operational availability of .com and .net and our focus is there and that's our first job and that's the primary requirement of the ICANN contract in terms of the SLAs and that's the first of our 4-part strategy framework, so we do focus there a lot. I think VeriSign's story sort of speaks for itself. We've supported an infrastructure that has allowed e-commerce to flourish and numerous billions of dollars of economic activity sit and rely on the infrastructure and I think it just simply speaks for itself that VeriSign is the secure and stable provider of that infrastructure, that's job 1 and whatever it takes to maintain that, we will.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And just any updates on some of the contracts you have for granting of new generic TLDs? I know you'd signed a number of the contracts before the bidding process went out and I'm just wondering if there had been any update to some of the arrangements you've had with your contacted parties?","D. James Bidzos","Let me just clarify. Are you talking about the applications we've made directly for the IDNs, the International...","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","No, the arrangements to provide back-end services?","D. James Bidzos","Oh, okay. For other brands who might want VeriSign to be their back-end service provider?","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes, precisely.","D. James Bidzos","Pat, go ahead, please.","Patrick S. Kane","This is Pat. So Gregg, there's been no change in that from the standpoint of where we are. The application window closed so we're not able to take on additional partners at this time. But basically, that process is moving ahead as ICANN has planned. And basically, they've been able to keep a better target on their current timeline such that we believe that, that will transpire in fall of 2013.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Fred Zeigel with Topeka Capital Markets.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Pat, to you, a couple of questions. First, on the international side, has there been a .com to ccTLD displacement as far as you can tell? Second, ICANN apparently, I guess, at their last meeting, approved or didn't stand in the way of a cross-ownership of registries and registrars then -- you're probably a bit hamstrung given your market share but what are your thoughts on that?","Patrick S. Kane","Well, let me address the first one. So you're asking are people choosing .com or choosing the local ccTLD over .com at this point in time?","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Patrick S. Kane","So there are some markets that certainly, some of the more established markets, that have a preference for the local ccTLD over .com. And if you take a look at Germany very specifically, DENIC, who runs .de, you've got a country with 83 million people and they've got 14 million or 15 million domain names registered in .de so there's a preference in markets like that. But there's still strong preference for .com in India, there's preference for .com in China as well as other nations that are growing. So it's a market by market but we don't see any major changes recently that we've been -- they've been fairly consistent for the last couple of years.","And then the second one, where you're talking about where ICANN has announced that if registry operators want to move to the new contract, that vertical integration could be considered, correct?","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Patrick S. Kane","So I think that's across the board that they've done that, I think that .com would of course, always be -- it's different. It will always be looked at differently and so I wouldn't suggest that, that's something that we would do if it was thrown out there but .com is always going to be looked at differently by Commerce and Justice, as Jim has talked about previously. So while it's available, I don't know that it's exactly available to .com.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Given your market share?","D. James Bidzos","I think it's hard to say. I mean that's an assessment that would be made on a case-by-case basis. But .com is different so it's really hard to say. We don't -- we haven't done any planning that would have us in a vertical integration scenario as an operating business. Our focus is really, security and stability first, and quite frankly, I think it might be awkward to actually act as a registrar ourselves. It's a very different business and as you may know, we were at one point, many years ago, in that business. When we first bought Network Solutions in June of 2000, it was of course, both a registry and a registrar and it wasn't until a few years later, I believe it was around 2003 when we sold off the retail part of that business and it was very different. So given the new sort of single focus that VeriSign is in right now, as a registry services provider, whose first mission is availability, when you consider for example, over the last 6 years, through a major restructuring, through the 2007, 2008, 2009 economic downturn, we've been able to maintain a record of security and stability. I'm sure a lot of you saw that just over the last few weeks, there were some major outages. I won't mention the names, but a large registrar and a large web services company just over the last few weeks had extended outages. If that happened to .com, I think there'd be a lot more tension, there'd be a lot more people affected, there'd be a lot more economic loss. So I sort of like us as a model focused on doing one thing, which is providing absolutely secure and stable infrastructure because there is just too much that depends on it here.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A question for George. We're at 56.4% non-GAAP operating margins in Q3 and you're suggesting or guiding to 55% plus in Q4, are we looking at higher ICANN expenses related to the $3.9 million from Q3?","George E. Kilguss","We absolutely will see increased expenses from ICANN in Q4. Having said that, we'll only have about 1 month of that. We still believe we'll be in excess of 55%, but we do have rising cost and we continue to look for opportunities to offset those rising costs as we move forward.","D. James Bidzos","And don't forget, in the ICANN agreement, in addition to the increased ICANN fees under the new .com registry agreement negotiated with ICANN, there are also far more stringent SLAs so we need to pay attention to that as well. So kind of paying higher fees and asked to do a little bit more, but that's what VeriSign does at  .com.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","This is under .com?","George E. Kilguss","Correct. This is under .com.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, this is under the .com registry agreement.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Under which -- under the new agreement that hasn't been approved?","D. James Bidzos","Well, under the agreement that was negotiated and approved with ICANN. It contains different ICANN fees that we pay, which George talked about. And it also includes more stringent SLAs. We are actually going to be -- we are already operating, obviously, as you know, given our uptime record. We are already operating beyond any published SLAs but the contract itself specifies the service levels that we have to provide and those have actually been made more stringent for VeriSign in the new agreement. So there's some good benefits for ICANN in that agreement.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Those expenses to you would not begin until the 1st of December? Am I understanding you right or no?","George E. Kilguss","It would commence with the renewal of the agreement, which ...","D. James Bidzos","Once the new agreement takes over, we are paying the higher ICANN fees.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Last question quickly to Jim. NIA, any update on what you're doing there?","D. James Bidzos","We're doing what we started saying, I believe, 2 or 3 quarters ago, that we were going to optimize NIA, we were going to structure it better for better quality of revenue. That originally when it was put together, it was focused on bookings growth. We've stopped focusing on bookings. We now focus on revenue and we're aligning expense with revenue and I'll just say that the team has really been working hard there and we've made really good progress and we're pleased with the direction that, that's moving. So it's more of the same, but we're very happy with the progress that we're making. I think that was the right thing for us to do and it's going well. I think that probably, it's helping us contribute to our efficient business, improving margins, increased revenue. It's not obviously, material or large enough that we call it out separately but it's moving in the right direction and we're very pleased with it.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Do we get to 10% of revenues in 2013 at some point?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I don't want to give any guidance here, but I don't think that's -- I don't think you should expect that to happen. I don't believe it will be material in 2013, let me put it that way.","Operator","We will take our last question from Jaimin Soni with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. First, if you look at the .net domain name adds this quarter, is it possible to quantify just how much of the delta versus guidance came from the search engine changes versus macro? And then, looking at guidance for next quarter, at the midpoint, it's a pretty big downtick versus what we've seen in prior fourth quarters in the past 3, 4 years. I'm just wondering is it more macro there or also a similar impact from search engine changes?","D. James Bidzos","This is Jim, let me just make a general comment then I'll ask Pat to give you a little bit more color. Yes, there were some macroeconomic headwinds, as we said earlier, particularly in Europe. Certainly, the search engine algorithm changes are a very large factor. Every year and every quarter that the zone grows, we see the law of large numbers, as we refer to it, come into play as well. Clearly, percentage growth will slow as the size of the zone gets larger. So there are a number of different factors. We have some analytics but we don't break that out separately but perhaps Pat can give you a little bit of color.","Patrick S. Kane","This is Pat. When you take a look at the renewal rate, that's largely -- where we've seen the shortfalls, really it's largely coming from monetization-type customers. I mean, that's individuals with large portfolios of domains, making pennies off of hundreds of thousands of domains, taking a look at what makes sense for their portfolio. So I would attribute the renewal rate more towards monetization than the macroeconomic trends right now although there's some in there. When you take a look at the new units, things that we have coming out of Europe right now, we're seeing registrars position domain names in the purchase flow that benefit local currency. So they're paying -- if it's a euro-based country, they're taking euro-based registrations and then we, of course, take all of our registrations in U.S. dollars. So there's some of that, that we see as part of the slight shortfall that we have in new units.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Atchley for concluding remarks.","David Atchley","Thank you.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim?","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign, and we're pleased with the results. In Naming, we again saw a record number of new registrations at 8.9 million while adding 2.86 million net names, finishing the quarter with 116.7 million names in the domain name base. ","In our NIA business, we again saw strong bookings growth. We were also able to achieve ongoing operating margin expansion through disciplined operations. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.35 billion in cash. ","During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $68.4 million. We have approximately $763 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization program, which have no expiration. ","We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","While basic shares outstanding stayed essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, our diluted share count, which is used for our diluted EPS calculation, increased in the first quarter. The main driver of this increase was dilution from our convertible bonds. As in the first and second quarters of 2011, we see dilution from our convertible bonds when our average stock price for the quarter is over the current conversion price of $34.37. These shares represent diluted shares and not shares that have been issued. John will provide more details on the share count and its impact during his comments.","On March 27, ICANN posted for public comment on their website the renewal terms for the .com Registry Agreement negotiated between VeriSign and ICANN. The terms are substantially the same as the terms contained in the existing .com Registry Agreement, except for new provisions regarding indemnification and audit rights, aligning it with the other 5 largest gTLD registry agreements including the .net agreement. Regarding ICANN's new gTLD program, VeriSign applied directly for 14 new gTLDs, 12 of these 14 are transliterations of .com and .net. ","Also, applicants for approximately 220 new gTLDs selected VeriSign to provide back-end registry services. It is still early in the process to determine what impact these applications will have on our revenue.","Depending on ICANN's pace for processing and approving these applications, revenue from new gTLDs is not expected before 2013 and is not expected to be material in 2013. We expect more details will be available when ICANN posts information regarding the new gTLDs for which applications were received. We expect that announcement in May.","Also, as announced today, VeriSign named George E. Kilguss, III as CFO effective May 14. George brings over 25 years of solid financial experience to VeriSign. Most recently, he has been serving as CFO at Internap and has been CFO of 3 public companies. We look forward to introducing you to George on the next earnings call.","Also, John will continue with the company as Vice President and Controller. I would like to thank John for his service as Interim CFO since last September.","I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, the base of registered names in .com and .net totaled approximately 116.7 million at the end of March. This represents an 8.1% increase year-over-year in the base and a 2.5% increase quarter-over-quarter.","In the first quarter, we added 2.86 million net names to the domain name base, and we processed 8.9 million new registrations, or a 7.7% increase in new registrations over the same period 1 year ago. The first quarter was a strong quarter on record for new registrations.","Internet adoption, e-commerce and online advertising continued to be drivers of our Registry business growth. Some of the first quarter strength was driven by 2 favorable factors: first, we saw improvement in the economics for domain name monetization; secondly, we saw some of our registrar customers have more success with their marketing programs during the quarter. The fourth quarter of 2011 renewal rate was 73.5%. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2012 will be approximately 74.3%.","We expect the second quarter net names added to the base to be between 1.8 million and 2.2 million names, reflecting continued growth in the underlying drivers of the Internet and seasonality. ","Our NIA business continues to perform well and exceeded its bookings target in the first quarter of 2012. With the NIA team in place, we're continuing to execute. More importantly, we continue to focus on scaling the NIA business to achieve quality revenue and stable growth.","Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Calys","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Jim explained, we're pleased to be announcing another solid quarter. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $206 million, delivered non-GAAP net income of $68 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 51.9%. These results drove approximately $101 million in the first quarter of free cash flow. Of our total cash and investment balance, about $245 million was domestic as of March 31, 2012. ","Let me recap our performance for the first quarter on our key operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. Then I will discuss our 2012 full year guidance.","Revenue of $206 million for the first quarter was up 13% year-over-year. Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $783 million, a $55 million increase from year end. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 51.9% compared to 50.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $99 million, down 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. ","Jim mentioned earlier that we applied directly for 14 new gTLDs. 13 of these applications occurred during the first quarter, which added $2.4 million of operating expense. The first quarter operating margin expansion was driven by revenue growth and through realizing efficiencies in our business. We will continue to look for further efficiencies in our business and other ways to improve our operating margin. ","Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $68 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 compared to $0.32 in the first quarter of 2011. ","With respect to taxes, we think a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 30% remains a reasonable estimate. In 2012, we expect to pay cash taxes of about $35 million to $50 million. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 163 million shares in the first quarter, compared to 160 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was approximately 2.5 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings presentation detailing the dilution calculation related to the convertible debentures.","Operating cash flow was $110 million for the first quarter compared to $90 million for the same quarter last year. Free cash flow was $101 million for the first quarter of 2012, given $4 million in excess tax benefits and $13 million in capital expenditures for the quarter. ","We saw solid performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income. We have a strong balance sheet and expect strong cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","With respect to 2012 guidance, we now think revenue for 2012 will be in the range of $870 million to $890 million, representing growth of 13% to 15%. We gave a range of $865 million to $890 million on the last call.","Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Q4 2012 exit non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be 52% to 54%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be a net expense of approximately $38 million for 2012. Capital expenditures are still expected to be 7% to 10% of revenue. Our guidance is based on expectations of continued growth and increased operating efficiencies in our business, in addition to financial projections for interest income and expense. ","I will now turn the call back to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, John. Before opening the call to your questions, I'd like to provide an update on our areas of focus for 2012. During the remainder of the year, we are focused on the following 5 areas: one, continue providing unparalleled Registry Services and network performance; two, continue to work with ICANN and the Department of Commerce towards a smooth renewal of our .com agreement; three, continue to invest in and grow the NIA business; four, as a post-restructuring next phase, focused on value creation for new services in our core business, factoring Q1, we've taken concrete steps to accelerate identification, testing and development of innovative new core services; five, and of course, continue to act as responsible stewards for the Internet infrastructure, which we operate. ","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","John, I'm wondering maybe on the guidance, the 1.8 million to 2.2 million. If I look at that versus your guidance 1 year ago, it's actually less than 1 year ago, and yet, the first quarter is running modestly ahead of what you're adds for next -- 1 year ago. So I'm just wondering, do you see something in the base or in the trends at the end of the quarter there that suggests that Q1 was more of an anomaly, and Q1 transact to a lower growth rate?","John Calys","That's a good question, Walter. I don't know that we see anything exiting the quarter that makes first quarter look like an anomaly to us. I know our guidance last year for the same quarter was higher. I think our actual performance for second quarter last year was 1.95 million net adds. So I think, really, what we have is the seasonality that we've talked about in the past. First quarter is always a little bit stronger based on activities that the registrars do with marketing, as well as just kind of seasonal patterns in the business. Pat, I don't know if you have anything to add?","Patrick S. Kane","No, I think that's about all.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just second question, Jim, on the -- it sounds like more of an emphasis on the [indiscernible] services and so forth. Can you talk about what role M&A may play at all in that process of looking a little bit -- get a little bit more aggressive about diversifying the business or expanding into adjacent areas?","D. James Bidzos","Sure. I don't expect M&A to play any substantial role at all in that growth. This is consistent with what we've been messaging for the last few quarters that we're very much focused inward on innovative opportunities in our core business. This company has a lot of talent, a lot of great ideas. And what we're doing is making sure that there's a way to rapidly exploit them. So the M&A is not part of that plan. As I've always said, we have a product roadmap that we like. And we see M&A as some way to get there quicker. We consider that, but there's nothing on our radar.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Steve Ashley at Robert W. Baird & Co.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","In terms of the domain name activity, I was going to ask about promotional activity and I realize that, that's in 2 buckets. One is, promotion activity that you yourselves, VeriSign, have worked onto revenues involved and then there's the amount of activity in the field. I'm just wondering if you could comment on either of those? How it related to maybe normal or last year?","D. James Bidzos","As far as the programs that we run that are contra-revenue programs, I think we've talked about that in the past that on a full year basis, they're not a significant amount, but we do some each quarter. And usually, they're a little more weighted towards the first part of the year, especially first quarter. So there is a little bit of the impact on the top line for the first quarter of this year in that. Pat, I don't know if you got comments about registrar activity?","Patrick S. Kane","So basically, on the contra programs, they're intended to be performance-based programs. And so the performance-based programs that we've put in there, we're actually augmenting the activity of the registrar. And so we've actually found programs incentives that are actually driving additional units that usually been more productive than in the past, and the performance has been better than in the past.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Terrific. And then could you just comment maybe at the high level of how international versus domestic domain name growth might have looked in the period?","Patrick S. Kane","So we still have strength coming out of international. Largely, we're seeing growth from India, we're seeing growth from China, as well as Southeast Asia and Australia from international standpoint. But it still looks to be about a 40%-60% split from international to domestic.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Phil Winslow at Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just got a question on just kind of spending from here, especially on the sort of non-domain name businesses. I mean how do you feel with sort of the OpEx level that you're at right now in terms of sort of growing the revenue from here. Are you comfortable with that or do you think this actually needs more investment over time?","John Calys","We certainly think there's an opportunity to always manage and get more efficient from an OpEx standpoint, Phil. I don't think we foresee some type of significant increase based on what we've guided to exit the year on. We're not expecting an increase in OpEx levels relative to revenue. In fact, we're still anticipating some improvement through the end of this year.","D. James Bidzos","Phil, this is Jim. I guess if you're referring at all specifically to some of the innovation efforts that are going on the company -- going on in the company, I think it's fair to say that given the operational efficiencies that we continue to find and exploit as the company sort of gets adjusted to its new size. Remember, we've gone from over 5,000 to just over 1,000 employees in 4 years. That and just some small reallocation of expenses throughout the company, we're pretty comfortable. Give us what we need to fuel the innovation engineer and do the kind of R&D that we need to do. So I think it's something from the outside of the -- essentially difficult to notice.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll hear from Sterling Auty at JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering, is it too early for you to tell in the gTLD program if any of the ones that you applied for were also applied for by others. In other words, could there be an auction or a need for increased investments to land some of those that you've applied for?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, this is Jim. So it is too early to tell. At some points, I can\/will reveal what the applications were, and they have a process for dealing with duplicate applications. As of right now, we can't tell you what that is. The process is being adjusted as we speak. And for an up-to-minute -- up-to-the-minute update, I'll ask Pat to comment on that.","Patrick S. Kane","Well, in terms of finding out when -- what additional top-level domains have been applied for beyond the ones that we have done. There's a process now that where the application system itself has to reopen at ICANN. It's been closed for a few days. And then after that happens, they will have a final submission and then there'll probably be a couple of weeks after that before ICANN announces. So it's kind of a moving target right now as to when that will occur. But we will certainly analyze it as soon as it opens up and identify where there are exact conflicts, where there will be conflicts that may create some end-user confusion, and we'll take a look at those as well.","D. James Bidzos","I think the original so-called reveal date for what strings were applied for was April 30. We expect that there'll be some short period of time beyond that before the actual new date is announced, which as Pat said, we expect to hear in a few days or so. Sometime in early May, we expect to know what strings were applied for. And at that point, any conflicts would be obvious, and as mentioned, ICANN has a process including an auction process to deal with competing bids and then that will play out at that time.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And there was an earlier question, I'm asking about timeshare revenue. I'm going to ask it this way, given the number of net adds that you had in the quarter, given the base of names that you had through the quarter, I think there's some of us that felt that the revenue would've been a little bit higher. So wondering, is it contra revenue business outside of the Naming business or something else that may have dampened top line by $1 million or $2 million or $3 million?","John Calys","Actually, I think from our standpoint, the top line was right about where we expected it internally. As far as the contra programs, there were no significant changes for the full year plan in 2012 versus 2011. There might have been a little bit more waiting in the first quarter, this year than last. But I don't think we expected something significantly different than what we're reporting.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, Jim. If you mentioned it, then I missed it, and I apologize. But in your prepared remarks, you talked about as one of the goals adding additional services to capitalize on the infrastructure and the position that you've got. Is there something specific that you can share with us now that you're looking to innovate beyond the stuff that's already in Naming and the other parts of the existing business?","D. James Bidzos","Well, it's no different than what we've talked about before. As I mentioned, there's a lot of talent and also a lot of ideas. And in fact, quite a bit of intellectual property here in the company. And I don't think we've worked as hard as we could have in the past to exploit it. So what the concrete steps that I referred to involve putting structures and people in place to make sure that we rapidly maximize our ability to exploit those ideas that we think can result in productive new innovative core services. So they are very much core services. I've mentioned in the past that we think that security is a very good place for us to focus. I don't think there's anybody anywhere on this planet that doesn't appreciate the need for cyber security. So that's the general area where we're looking to enhance our offerings. And that's probably as much as I can say right now.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Rob Owens at Pacific Crest Securities.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about some of the success you're seeing in NIA and maybe some of the -- a little bit of color on the bookings there. It seemed like the deferred categories group better than I was expecting this quarter?","John Calys","As far as the deferred category, certainly, it was very strong. The growth in that really relates to the 2.86 million net adds and 8.9 new registrations that's driving deferred much more than anything from an NIA standpoint.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","So on that -- specifically there, are you seeing an extension in duration then in terms of some of those renewals or new names? Or are you still about 5 quarters on average?","D. James Bidzos","The average term length is about 5 quarters right now when we see with renewals.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Actually a pretty big change, I think, in long-term deferred if I'm not taken. Historical numbers.","John Calys","For the first quarter, I think, seasonally is always a strong increase in deferred for us. So -- but certainly much more than sequential quarter was -- last quarter.","D. James Bidzos","As John said, that's attributable to areas outside of NIA. But with respect to NIA, we set some bookings goals for them for the quarter that were in excess of the goals that we set last year. And they're exceeding those goals. So we're pleased with the process. We're not breaking out those numbers separately.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","If it were to achieve 10% of bookings, would you break it out separately?","John Calys","If NIA were to achieve -- if their revenue were to achieve 10% of total revenue, we would break it out separately under SEC reporting requirements. Yes.","Rob D. Owens - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then second, how many names are up for renewal in Q2?","Patrick S. Kane","24.4 million.","Operator","Next, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Jaimin Soni.","Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just got a couple of quick questions. First, I wanted to ask about operating margins. In your guidance, you have about 100 basis points ramp through the year. As we exit the year, and I guess as you continue to get more efficient, is that where we can see more of the listed margins going forward? Or do you think you have room to invest more in some of the opportunities that Jim outlined earlier?","D. James Bidzos","Certainly, we see margin improvement through the end of the year as we've guided in the 52% to 54% range. And as we -- as I commented earlier, and we've spoken many times before in kind of our post-restructuring era here, we continue to work hard daily at finding opportunities to grow our margin, to get more efficient, to do things smarter and better. Obviously, we'll see in the revenue -- on the revenue line, we'll see the impact of the price increases that we did in January. And as you know, that kind of bleeds into the revenue line over about a 5-quarter period. So that gives you some even natural margin growth as well, that comes about from that. Beyond that, we obviously haven't provided guidance beyond the end of 2012. But we take very seriously that it's our job to run the business very efficiently and find ways to do things better and smarter all the time.","Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Another -- just another follow-up on the net domain name ads. If I look at what you guys have guided last quarter for the year, it's at about 6% to 8% unit growth rate for net new names. Looking at what you have -- at the midpoint, guided to about 2 million for next quarter. And seeing the first half total net new name growth at about 1% to 2%, implies that the second half should really accelerate. Is that what we should think about for the second half of the year in terms of net new name growth?","Patrick S. Kane","No, I mean, the 2.5% is quarter-over-quarter, right? And so year-over-year, right now, we're at 8.1%. So you should see some consistency in quarter-over-quarter growth.","John Calys","Yes, our revenue guidance of the $870 million to $890 million that I mentioned earlier is predicated on a 6% to 8% unit -- net unit growth for the year over the prior year. And at this point, we would say we're trending toward the upper half of that range.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Jim, there was a very nice increase in the expected renewal rate for Q1 versus what you've reported over the prior few quarters. Aside from perhaps getting some benefit from a renewal base that's becoming more mature, were there any other factors that might have contributed to the higher renewals that you expect to see this quarter?","D. James Bidzos","Well, in Q1, we did have a higher early renewal. Early renewals were up in Q1, which helps explain the increase in deferred revenue. Other than that, I'm not aware of any changes that...","Patrick S. Kane","The behavior is as expected. So it's consistent. So what we'll is some variability in 1\/10 percentage points based upon specific registrars and what they're doing with their customers and different programs that they may or may not run. So even though it's up by a couple of 1\/10% in terms of where we thought we'd end up, it's well within expectations.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And that's great. You've gotten attached to a large number of back-end applicants. Frankly, you have more than I would've expected. Although a lot of these I would imagine would be relegated to somewhat of a niche type status assuming their applications are accepted. What I wanted to ask is -- and I know this is not a material 2013 impact, but just kind of wondering, on a longer-term basis, given what we know today and how you see this potentially unfolding, whether you see a greater opportunity directionally for VeriSign on the front end or the back end around new gTLDs?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, this is Jim. I think -- well, certainly 2013 is too early. And we don't think there'll be any material revenue in 2013. And I think it's just too early to speculate about what that revenue will look like beyond. We're certainly pleased that over 200 applicants have chosen us to be their back-end registry service provider. But how -- and we're -- we like the program. We think that it's going to, as ICANN, encourage creativity, and we hope it will grow the market globally for domain names. But how much of that will grow, what exactly what our participation will be, how these 220 applicants that have chosen us to provide services then will fare in that new market. I think it's just too early to speculate about that. We have said that we do see that as a growth area. I think that it's going to expand the market. And we're pleased to be participating in it, both through directly applying to operate gTLDs. And as you said, providing services for 220. But beyond that, I think it is just too early for us to speculate.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, from CLSA, Ed Maguire.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I saw you had posted last month the RFC for the .com renewal contract. Are there any issues that you could anticipate that might come up, that might result in any changes to proposal? And any update on expected timing of finalizing that contract?","D. James Bidzos","Well, there is -- this is Jim, there is a published timeline for that. I can't have a fixed duration comment period. They are -- I think, it would be inappropriate for us to comment on -- to comment while the comment period is still up. But there is a fixed process. And at some point, ICANN and VeriSign will complete that process. ICANN will receive the comments and respond to them and then the agreement will be turned over to the Commerce Department for its consent of the renewal. The agreement expires on November 30, so that's the timeline to complete this process by then. And our plan is to follow the timeline and work through it. I think, again, .com had a similar process. Of course, to accept it, it did require Commerce Department approval. But essentially it went through an open comment process. There were responses to those comments and then ICANN board voted to approve the contract. Our expectation is that there will be a similar process here.","Edward Maguire - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up on cash. Just currently, how much do you have offshore and whether you have any ability to move some of that onshore?","John Calys","We have about $1.1 billion offshore right now, $245 million domestically. No specific plans right now to move any of the offshore cash back at this point in time.","Operator","And we'll take our final question today from Craig Nankervis with First Analysis.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","My questions have really basically been asked. Maybe just a little more on the 220 new gTLDs that you've been selected to provide back-end services. Have you had discussions with most of these entities? Or is that -- was that number basically entirely a surprise to you, and how do you think about that quantity?","D. James Bidzos","I'll let Pat weigh in, in more detail, but some of those applicants actually ran competitive bid processes to select the back-end services provider. And we were successful as a competitor in that process for many of them. We've certainly entered into agreements with all of them at this point. I don't know that I can comment on how that fell with expectations. I think, given that the ICANN has said nothing about the number of applicants, it's probably inappropriate to speculate about how many there were or how we did. Pat? I would like Pat to comment.","Patrick S. Kane","Well, as you said, Jim, it's hard to tell where it falls into a total number of top level domains that have been applied for. But we are pleased with the number, and we are pleased with the quality of the partners that have chosen VeriSign to provide back-end services for their offerings, as they see it as a valuable asset in terms of how they move their businesses forward as well.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","So assuming -- so I guess, what has to happen, they have to all -- each of those have to get their gTLD approved and then assuming that's the case, it's very likely you would be -- you would operate for the back end for everyone on that, for all of that group, right? There wouldn't be a reason you'd be selective within the group, is there?","Patrick S. Kane","No, those 220 have already said that if they are awarded a TLD by ICANN, that VeriSign will act as the operator of back-end registry services for them. So that's the agreement we've already entered into.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, we've agreed to do that. So there's no reason that the number would change from our perspective. And as Pat mentioned, they have specified us in their application as the provider, so we assume that -- but that's our expectation. That if their applications are approved, we will be their back-end registry services provider.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","I see. And does that -- as this unfolds, does this have any implications for your infrastructure and build out thereof or really not? How does that -- how do you look at that?","Patrick S. Kane","Well, I think we have world-class infrastructure that can certainly handle the types of business that we've taken and put onto. So I'm -- and I think that it's well within our capabilities.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Well, yes, so capabilities. I guess -- so it doesn't -- it's not going to -- I don't know, necessitate a different pattern to your CapEx spending or something like that because of this new dynamic.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, this is Jim. I don't think we anticipate anything substantial on that sense. I think we really need to look at the nature and the use and the deployment of some of these TLDs. But for example, many of them are brands who are probably going to have a very small number of domain names associated with their TLDs that we'll operate for them. So I don't think of this as a major overhaul of our infrastructure in order to support it. I think they -- for them, even if it's a small number of domain names, if it's an important brand, I think security and stability and availability are really the important things which is why they chose us. And we're certainly going to continue to provide that. We'll make the normal investments that we make in our infrastructure to provide that security and stability, but I believe that's what appealed to most of them.","Craig Nankervis - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division","Sure, sure. And I wasn't trying to imply that you have to have a major overhaul to what you have. I was just curious if it changes the pattern of how you operate with incorporating these...","D. James Bidzos","Well, we operate multiple domains now, so we're -- we have for a long time. So we're structured to operate multiple domains. While this could change over time, I don't -- I wouldn't expect that given a circumstance as you'd expect to see a substantial increase in the overall number of domain names. Again, if these are brands, the number of new domain names within the gTLDs would be relatively small. But it will be important that they resolve reliably, and I think that's why we were chosen.","Operator","Now this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Atchley. Please go ahead, sir.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator.

Our third quarter results demonstrate that we're on track with our full year 2013 plans. We reported revenue of $244 million, which was 9% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $134 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.3 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.55 million net new names, bringing our name base to a total of $125.9 million active .com and .net domain names.","Our balance sheet remains strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business.","As part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 6.8 million shares for $331 million. At the end of third quarter, $697 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","In today's press release, we announced an update related to our work in reviewing our current tax structure. As you'll note from the press release, we expect to file for a worthless stock deduction, that if claimed, we estimate will yield an income tax benefit of approximately $300 million to $400 million, which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. Our tax work remains ongoing, and we expect to provide further updates during our fourth quarter earnings call. George will discuss this update in more details in a few moments.","For the last few quarters, I discussed our continuing focus on innovation and intellectual property. Our R&D team continues to actively research and develop new concepts and to evaluate new ideas to improve our current technologies and services and to invent new ones. These efforts support our strategic framework and enhance our ability to create innovative technologies and services.","As part of our IP strategy we have made, and continue to make, substantial investments in IP. Over the last several years, these investments have included a significant increase in the number of patent applications filed by VeriSign in the United States and Europe. This increase in patent applications supports our strategy to continuously serve our customers and partners in innovative ways through our products and services and to make sure that others only use our IP under appropriate licenses from VeriSign.","Over the years, VeriSign's commitment to performance and reliability in our registry operations have led us to innovate energetically and to develop capabilities that are not available from off-the-shelf products. As of the end of the third quarter, VeriSign has a patent portfolio with a combined total of 231 patents and patent applications in the U.S., plus 304 granted and pending patent applications in other countries. Our patent portfolio includes 127 granted or pending applications in the U.S. that we believe protect inventions that enable our core registry operations.","While we've not decided the best ways to fully utilize our IP assets, and it's too early to provide any guidance on how we can use them in the future, supporting our business goals and strategic framework will always drive those decisions. More information about VeriSign's leadership through innovation is available in our new white paper titled VeriSign Innovation, Exceeding the Standard for Registry Operations, located at verisigninc.com\/innovation. An additional resource to better understand how our U.S. patents pertain to VeriSign's product and service offerings is available at verisignpatents.com.","We also have the goal, through our innovation efforts, to offer additional product and services. This work is ongoing, and we're pleased with the progress. This summer, the company hired a Senior Product Executive to lead the development of these new products and services. We had hoped to announce a new product before the end of the year, but this is taking a little longer. However, I am pleased to say that we're in the process of contracting with a customer to pilot this product. Currently, we don't have more to say about this pilot program we're offering, but we will keep you updated when appropriate on our efforts.","ICANN continues to make progress on its new gTLD program. This week, the first 4 IDNs, or Internationalized Domain Names, as part of this program, were delegated into the root zone. At this point, we're not sure of the timing for our own new gTLD applications or for the back-end Registry Services that we'll be providing, but we will provide updates as appropriate regarding the status of our applications.","I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 125.9 million, consisting of 110.7 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 5% year-over-year. In the third quarter, we added 1.55 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.3 million new gross registrations.","In the second quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 72.9% for the second quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2013 will be approximately 72.5%, or flat as compared to the third quarter of 2012.","As we have discussed over the last few quarters, the overall renewal rates softened primarily due to the lower renewal rates for first time renewing names. Given our forecast for zone growth, including the factors affecting first time renewal rates and seasonal trends, we expect .com and .net names added to the zone in the fourth quarter to be between 1.1 million and 1.5 million names.","As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarters. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As we've stated on prior calls, we have been examining our tax structure. Today, I would like to discuss the results of our tax work to date. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect to liquidate, for tax purposes, one of our domestic subsidiaries, which we expect will allow us to claim a worthless stock deduction on our 2013 federal income tax return. If claimed, based on our preliminary estimates, we expect to record an income tax benefit during the fourth quarter of 2013 ranging from approximately $300 million to $400 million related to the worthless stock deduction, net of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions recorded as required under U.S. GAAP.","The worthless stock deduction may be subject to audit and adjustment by the IRS, which could result in reversal of all, part or none of the income tax benefit, or could result in a benefit higher than the net amount we initially record. We cannot guarantee the liquidation of this subsidiary will occur as described, or at all, or what the ultimate outcome, use or amount of the benefit we receive will be, if any. The financial statement carrying value of this subsidiary is not material.","While we expect our domestic operations to generate sufficient taxable income to fully use the expected tax benefits of the ordinary loss on the worthless stock deduction, we are analyzing and evaluating various scenarios for realizing the benefit. Although our current intent remains to indefinitely reinvest outside of the U.S. those funds held by foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the U.S., and accordingly, we have not provided deferred U.S. taxes for such funds, we anticipate reevaluating our overall business structure and financing of foreign operations as part of this analysis. If the conclusion of this analysis results in a change to our current strategy related to foreign operations, we may be required to accrue an additional U.S. tax obligation, although we cannot predict what such amount, if any, may be.","Based upon the audited statutory financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2012, on a combined basis, our foreign subsidiaries have up to approximately $600 million of distributable capital under applicable foreign statutes. We do not know what the ultimate outcome, if any, will be resulting from this analysis and evaluation.","I would now like to discuss our third quarter financial results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $244 million, up 9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $133 million, up 14.3% from $116 million in the third quarter of 2012. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 54.5% compared to 51.9% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $81 million compared to $78 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.53 in the third quarter of this year compared to $0.47 for the third quarter last year. As of September 30, 2013, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion. Liabilities totaled $2.8 billion at the quarter and.","I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2013 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $244 million for the third quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from foreign customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $858 million, a $45 million increase from year-end 2012.","Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10.6 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million compared with $98 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $98 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter expanded to 58.8% compared to 56.4% in the same quarter of 2012. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $90 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.59 compared to $0.50 in the third quarter of 2012 and $0.58 last quarter.","With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS calculations. In 2013, we now expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $25 million to $30 million, assuming we claim the benefit of the worthless stock deduction in 2013.","We had a weighted average diluted share count of 153 million shares in the third quarter compared to 159 million shares in the second quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 10.5 million shares based on the average share pricing during the third quarter compared with 9.2 million for the same quarter in 2012. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 6.8 million shares repurchased during the third quarter.","Operating cash flow was $134 million for the third quarter compared to $147 million in the second quarter of 2013 and $122 million for the third quarter last year. Third quarter free cash flow was $134 million. Of the $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, $389 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally.","With respect to 2013, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue and capital expenditure projections as follows. Revenue for 2013 is now expected to be in the range of $960 million to $965 million, representing an annual growth rate of 10%. This is an increase from the $952 million to $962 million, or a growth rate of 9% to 10% given on our last earnings call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.","Full year 2013 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 58% and 59%, as we expect an acceleration of sales and marketing spend during the fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $60 million and $62 million for 2013.","Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $65 million and $75 million, changed from the $60 million to $80 million range given on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook for our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q3 2012. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Finally, I wanted to note to you an update in our reporting schedule going forward. After reviewing the reporting schedule of our peer group, and with the desire to decrease the time between our fourth quarter earnings release and the issuance of our 10-K, we expect our fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings release and earnings call to be held 2 weeks later than in the past. This change affects only our fourth quarter and full year earnings release. Other quarterly dates would remain similar to prior practice. We expect to hold our fourth quarter 2013 and full year 2013 earnings release and earnings call during the first week of February 2014.","Now, I will return the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. During the third quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value. We have protected our business by providing over 15 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net registries. This track record is due to the strength and experience of our people, our commitment to excellence, our specialized and purpose-built network, and the extensive redundancy built into our infrastructure. Our focus on innovation supports our business growth initiatives as we continuously work to develop new products and services.","Finally, we've been managing the business effectively through expansion of our operating margins and delivering value to shareholders. In addition to the $300 million to $400 million expected income tax benefit, we announced today, through the third quarter of this year, we have repurchased 16.9 million shares for $797 million, representing 11% of the 153.4 million shares that were outstanding at the end of 2012. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders.","We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I did want to ask, just given the strength that we saw in net adds this quarter, I was a bit surprised to see deferred revenue be essentially flat on a sequential basis. Just wondering if there were any onetime items or adjustments that might have gone into deferred?","George E. Kilguss","Nothing material, Gregg. This is George Kilguss. We had a minor true up in the quarter, but it wasn't material related to our .jobs operation. But no, we had a good quarter with regard to gross additions. They came in a little stronger than we expected, but we were pleased with those results.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And George, you mentioned that you do expect to accelerate your sales and marketing spend in Q4. Can you put a finer point on the nature and amount of the increased investment there?","George E. Kilguss","Well, Gregg, we don't guide to fourth quarter sales and marketing. But if you recall, back on our comments in -- earlier in the year, we did have an amount of roughly about $5 million that we had delayed into later parts of the year. We have a number of marketing activities that are going on right now, and we have registrars subscribing up for some of those programs, so we absolutely are expecting that spend to increase. But some of those -- that spend is dependent on registrars and other folks subscribing up to programs. But we absolutely have a significant amount of marketing going on in the fourth quarter.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And George, is any of that in relation to the new gTLDs or just completely independent from that?","George E. Kilguss","I would say most of the programs that are running today are on, primarily .com and .net activities.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right, okay. And then just one last one for me, as a clarification regarding the worthless stock. With the income tax benefit, if it does arise in Q4, would that be treated as GAAP only? Or do you envision treating that in a non-GAAP format as well?","George E. Kilguss","No, it would just be from a GAAP perspective.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And Sterling Auty with JPMorgan has our next question.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The $600 million in capital available to be distributed internationally is a far cry from the actual international cash balance that's offshore. Can you talk to us about what causes the limitation? What you might be able to do with the other international cash beyond just this program?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Sterling. So let me first say that as it relates to the $600 million discussed in our prepared remarks, this was the combined amount of distributable reserves in our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012, which is the last statutory audits that we've had filed. My intent in the disclosure was to simply provide the shareholders some more insight into our foreign capital structure, as they have had questions around this area in the past. As you know, we get questions around foreign cash balances all the time. And I was just letting folks know that we are bound by certain foreign statutes. The distributor reserves, just for clarification, are the amount of funds as of 12\/31, 2012, that the foreign entities could have distributed through dividends to the U.S. patent at that time. Again, while we've not changed from our current position of these funds being indefinitely reinvested overseas, we are conducting additional reviews in the area, and we'll go through an evaluation process on that. We'll provide you an update, and that now still is ongoing in the fourth quarter. To be a little more specific, the amounts over the distributable reserves overseas, I think we've mentioned this before, some of our cash overseas came from divestitures. And that is where the balance of those distributables -- those amounts that cash over has come from, from the divestitures, other than from a generating income over there. And we're looking at that, and I'll have more to hopefully say to you on our fourth quarter call.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the last part that you just said, there's the chance or there -- you're looking into ways that perhaps the amounts above the $600 million could also be utilized beyond just internationally?","George E. Kilguss","Again, we're looking at evaluating and reevaluating our international cash. We're looking at that. That work is ongoing. I don't have any determinations here today to talk about -- but we're clearly looking at that.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then Jim, I wanted to talk a little bit about the new products. It's been some time. You mentioned that you're hopeful to get a product out. It doesn't look like it's going to come this year, but you had a new head put in place in terms of heading new products in. What I'm curious about is how you're doing the business planning around the new solution that you're possibly taking to pilot in terms of the types of returns that you're expecting to get out of the investment, or how much investment you're going to put around it? So what's the strategy in terms of how you're thinking about putting new products into the marketplace and how much investment will go to support it?","D. James Bidzos","Well we don't -- we obviously can't guide to the expenses directly attributable to any new product or anything specific about the product's expenses. But going back to what we set out as goals for some of the innovation that we funded, going back over a year ago, we look for products and that would leverage the existing network that could be covered by intellectual property for us and that yielded margins similar to the core business. So those are the goals for the new products. And when we say that we're pleased with the progress that we're making with some of the new products coming out of what we call the hive, our innovation facility here, they're meeting those requirements. So we also mentioned back when we talked about innovation, that what we're doing is exploiting intellectual capital that the company had, that we have a lot of good ideas on how to utilize our network in more efficient ways to offer new products and services, things that would leverage the investment that we've already made in this high-availability, high-performance, purpose-built network. So I can tell you that it meets all of those requirements. I think it's early to say more than that, but -- and you're right, we're now engaged in contracting for a pilot for this project. So we are making progress, but I think beyond that, it's too early to say more.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Last question, if I may. The changes to the algorithms and search engines, there had been some talk that maybe there are some additional ones that occurred over the last month or so. Is that the case? And it seemed like the name additions were still pretty good. Are we getting to the point of diminishing returns where maybe some of those changes are having less and less impact on the actual growth in the zone?","George E. Kilguss","Go ahead, Pat. Why don't you...","Patrick S. Kane","So this is Pat. So I think what you're referring to is the Hummingbird release at Google. And, basically, they pushed that out on October 3. And the foundation for this release appears to be more about natural conversations. So they're really looking at the mobile space right now with that, and we've not seen a lot of impact on the domain names because of that. But it's a change, and things I've read about -- that is from Google. This is just the first major really restructuring change since 2001 on the algorithm. So they're going to keep tweaking on it. It's really one of these things that's geared towards mobility, I believe.","Operator","And we'll go on to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","George, I was just going back into the tax planning and the worthless stock, involved in it is a subsidiary. I'm just wondering if there was any color you could give us around this subsidiary, and where the value of this asset had been or where it's coming from?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, sure. I mean, all I can really tell you is that it's a subsidiary that has a large tax basis, and that was prior -- it was part of a prior acquisition. But the worthless stock deduction, really is a situation where we have a situation where a stock can become worthless, and you take a claim for that. And so, that happens on the occurrence of certain events, and the event that we're talking about is the expectation of liquidating the subsidiary.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then if I could just maybe turn to the new gTLDs. You mentioned that 4 have gone all the way through the funnel and have been delegated to the root and those were 4 IDNs, and it didn't sound like those were any of the ones that you currently own. But as we just look, going forward, I'm just wondering if you have any comments about what the general timing of icon, moving names through the process in getting the 220 potential customers you have through that process and maybe the other TLDs that you own directly, as we look into next year, if you have any expectation or color you can provide us around that.","D. James Bidzos","Yes, I think it's early for us to predict what's going to happen to our own applications or the applications of our other customers. There are -- the 4 IDMs that were delegated this week, the first of those was actually contracted back in the ICANN meeting in Durban, which was in mid-July. So they're very early. I'm not sure exactly what the contracting status of all of the applications are, but I believe it's around or less than 100 that are in contracting. So we have less than 10% that have reached the contracting phase. And until that's done, they can't get onto the delegation phase. And there's still some work in the -- they're pursuing something called the alternate path to delegation that ICANN provided just very, very recently. And they have to do some blocking in second level domains. The non-alternate path is a more comprehensive, security and stability planning qualitative analysis, so there's -- and sorry, ICANN is still actually developing that process. They're conducting more study to provide more data to inform that process. So I think it's early at this point to speculate exactly what the pace and timing for these other ones will be. Pat, do you want to add anything to that?","Patrick S. Kane","No, I think it's exactly right. Just it's, basically, if you move forward on either path, there's a process you can accept the standard agreement if you negotiate and you want other terms inside that agreement, that'll certainly take longer. And that's going to be up to the individual applicant at that point in time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll now go to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Harris Heyer","This is Harry Heyer for Phil. I know you talked a little bit about building out your IP portfolio. And I was wondering if you might be able to give a little bit of detail on your IP monetization strategy?","D. James Bidzos","We have not yet finalized that strategy, as I mentioned, it's early for us to detail that. I think what we announced today is the availability of 2 resources on our website. The first one is the white paper, and I would encourage you to read it. It's easier to read than it is for me to describe. It's essentially -- I'll try though, anyway. It's a survey of the innovation that we've done that we've brought to our infrastructure that we think will benefit our customers. Whether it's all of the global Internet users, who benefit from our resolution services or from our back-end registry services customer. So again, the white paper is available at www.verisign.com\/innovation. And so that gives you a lot of context in terms of how the patents are grouped and what particular areas you'll find that we described our innovation efforts and then some of the IP that those efforts have yielded by category. So I think you'll be able to get a broad idea, a big picture idea of where we've been innovating and some rough idea of the categories and number of patents that we have in that area. And I also mention that we do have another resource, verisignpatents.com. And there, what you'll find is a specific list of patents and how they apply to the various products and services that we offer. So if you're interested in just absolute numbers of patents that apply to various services offered by VeriSign, you'll find what's essentially sort of a patent marking website there. So beyond that, we've not gone into any detail on how this portfolio of intellectual property will be used, other than to say we will certainly explore ways to further our business interests with it.","Operator","And our final question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just kind of tagging on that IP question there. Sorry, this is Ken Wong for Walter. So tagging on that IP question, I mean is it -- mean, it seems like it's somewhat -- at this stage, it might be somewhat limited to potentially pursuing licensing from other registries, which makes sense with a bunch of gTLDs coming along. I mean, is it more than that? Should we be looking at you guys potentially being able to license this to other Internet service providers? Or is it more limited to just registry\/registrar type functionality?","D. James Bidzos","It's more than that. I mean, we operate a high-reliability infrastructure that involves high-performance and redundancy. And so these patents cover the entire broad swath of the technology category that applies to everything we do, which is certainly at its core, registry operation. Some of these functions interact with registrar functions and intersect with them. But again, I'd encourage you -- I think you'll find the White Paper very informative in this regard.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. Yes, will definitely check it out. As then second, I guess we haven't heard you guys talk much about the NIA business recently. Any color on how that business is growing? And should we still kind of view that as an area of kind of serious investment from you guys?","D. James Bidzos","I'm sorry, I didn't hear the very last part.","Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, should we -- just, I mean, should we still view that as an area, where you guys are putting good resources behind in terms of investing in that particular business?","D. James Bidzos","We have made substantial investments over the years in NIA. And I mentioned in recent calls, 3 quarters ago -- 2 quarters ago, that what we're doing was streamlining NIA and structuring it better to scale going forward, that we were aligning expenses with revenue in the business. And we're making progress in all of those areas. It's still at a point where we're not calling it out separately or talking about it separately, but in the 3 categories, iDefense, which is threat intelligence, Managed DNS and also DDoS, we do see opportunities in all those areas, and we continue to actively grow that business. I think, at some point, we'll get to a point where we'll talk about separately, but we're not there now.","Operator","And we have no additional questions. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for your final or closing remarks.","David Atchley","Thank you, Catherine.

James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. We reported revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $171 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.52 million net new names ending with 133.5 million dot-com and dot-net domain names in the domain name base.","Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our track record of returning cash to shareholders continued during the second quarter as we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $156 million. As of June 30, 2015, we have $761 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. Today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a dot-net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN.","As of February 21, 2016, the annual wholesale fee for dot-net domain name registration will increase from $6.79 to $7.46. As of the end of Q2, there were approximately 15 million dot-net registered names. Also, as you recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name versions of com and net.","Based primarily on feedback from domain name community stakeholders, we have revised our IDN launch strategy. We will offer these new IDN top-level domains as standalone domain names, subject to normal introductory availability and rights protection mechanisms, available to all new gTLDs. This revised approach will not require ICANN approval and is designed to provide end users and businesses with the greatest flexibility and, for registrars, a simple and straightforward framework to serve the market.","Finally, we believe this approach should provide the best opportunity for increased universal acceptance of IDNs. We expect to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year, and we'll provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate.","I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in com and net was 133.5 million, consisting of 118.5 million names for dot-com and 15 million names for dot-net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the second quarter, we added 0.52 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations.","In the first quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.4%, compared with 72.6% for the first quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2015 will be approximately 72.6%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2014.","As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain name growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting third quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between point 0.6 million and 1.1 million names.","As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over George.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $149 million, up 4.1% from $143 million in the second quarter of 2014.","The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.7%, compared to 57.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $93 million, compared to $100 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.71 for the second quarter last year. GAAP net income was lower year-over-year, primarily based on an increase in interest expense related to the new senior notes and contingent interest on the convertible debentures.","As of June 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $844 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally.","Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014.","I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I'll then discuss our 2015 full year guidance.","As mentioned, revenue totaled $263 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter totaled $932 million, a $41 million increase from year-end 2014.","Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million, down from $104 million in the first quarter of 2015 and compared with $98 million in the same quarter a year ago.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 61.3%, compared to 60.9% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.3 million shares. This compares to $0.68 in the second quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter, using 141.1 million and 133.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.","Year-over-year non-GAAP earnings per share improved primarily due to a lower share count and the use of a 26% non-GAAP tax rate this year compared with last year's 28% non-GAAP tax rate.","Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $175 million and $171 million, respectively, compared with $121 million and $129 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily related to last year's second quarter international cash tax payment related to the offshore repatriation of cash.","Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international.","With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.055 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3.5% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1.043 billion to $1.057 billion given on our last call.","Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is also still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $104 million, and $110 million.","Capital expenditures for the year are also still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, George. During the second quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value to our shareholders. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. We continue to actively invest in the development of new products, technologies, and services. Finally, we have been managing the business effectively, as demonstrated by our operating margins, efficient capital structure, and through the return of value to shareholders by share repurchases.","We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders.","Just this past week, we marked 18 continuous years of 100% availability of the dot-com and dot-net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more and more important.","We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back, Jim, to the revised strategy and maybe you can just help us understand what has changed? What is the revision and how is it different from the original plan you had?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Okay. Originally, we had a modified plan for a sunrise offering where we would reserve some names for certain pre-registered names in IDN.com. Based on feedback that we received from the community, it seems that it will work better for everyone and the preference on the part of our community, especially brand-holders is that we offer a standard form of sunrise. So that means that we will proceed with a standard TLD rollout for all of our IDNs, which does not require any ICANN approval.","I think the important difference here in today's news versus what we talked about to you a quarter ago is that we no longer are waiting or require any ICANN approval, and we have some more certainty around the timing in rollout. We know what we need to do now. We have the set activities that precede an actual rollout. So we can say with some confidence that our staged rollout of our 11 IDNs will begin by the end of the year.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Under the previous plan, you had really hoped to provide, I think, more protection to brand-holders by extending the sunrise period and making sure that a named dot-com holder had the rights to \u2013 they would have \u2013 be the only ones who would have the rights to the new IDNs. Are you saying now that the third-parties after the sunrise period would be able to buy some of these IDNs?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Under some circumstances that might be possible. There are a number of different approaches that are available to all TLD registries under the new RA that we signed, the new registry agreement. And so, our marketing plan could include some of the capabilities that you talked about. What we aren't doing is specifying a plan that requires approval from ICANN that doesn't contain some of the precise sunrise provisions that were there before. It's a standard sunrise that will be rolled out. And I would like Pat to comment further on that part of the process.","Patrick S. Kane - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, definitely we would contemplate changing is to not hold a reservation for grandfathered dot-com registrations during the sunrise. And that's the modification that we were trying to get approval from ICANN on. And we've taken that out, so we can move forward.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. We'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, guys. Wondering first on the IDNs, will all of your IDNs roll out simultaneously? Or will it be a phased rollout beginning at the end of the year?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","The rollout will be phased. We're not going to roll out all 11 at once. You shouldn't expect that we're going to sequentially space out 11 either. It'll be phased. It'll be based on a number of different considerations. Certainly, the size of each market, the complexity of each market, the opportunity as it exists will all be factors. But we can say that the rollout will begin before the end of the year.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there any update on pricing that you're willing to give us at this point?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Only that we're still working on it. And that, as you know, we do have complete flexibility by each individual IDN and by each region. So, we also have the flexibility to utilize premium pricing. There are a number of different \u2013 of course, it's very different from the provisions of the dot-com registry agreements. So, we have tremendous flexibility. So, we are working through that. But I don't expect that to slow down the rollout. And it is a bit early for us to describe to you what that pricing will be.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And last question, have you guys done any additional work so I get a sense of what the dot-com and dot-net pace looks like in each of the regions that you're going to rollout an IDN. So in other words, is there any sense of what we can expect in terms of uptake once they launch?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Okay. I'm not sure I understand your question exactly, Sterling. Are you saying that an analysis of existing...","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","If you look at where those IDNs are targeted in terms of the languages, so if you look at the countries of those languages. We talked a little bit about this last quarter. I didn't know if you went back and did any additional work to say: well, of the dot-com base you see this many names in that region and you'd take a reasonable percentage that might also want that IDN. Here's what the uptake might look like.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, first of all, we don't have precise visibility into that because, of course, we're working through registrars and not all the Whois data is available to us. So, it's not with great precision that we understand exactly what the distribution of com registrations is geographically. But of course, we do have some idea, and we are very aware of that. And that certainly factors into our plans. But I'm not sure if I answered your question.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, I think that's fine. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","We'll go next to Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, this is actually Priya Parasuraman in for Gray. Could you talk about renewal rates, particularly with respect to first time and previously renewed rates? And also across geographic market?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. So, this is George Kilguss. Your first question was on renewal rates. So our renewal rate for the second quarter was 72.6%, clearly up from 71.8% a year ago. We continue to see improvement in that renewal rate, primarily as a result of previously renewed names. We saw about a 70 basis points increase year-over-year, to about 82.6% of previous renewed rate. First time renewal rates are close to 50% still. And so, most of the improvement we've seen have been in previously renewed rates.","As far as domestic, I think you were asking about different geographies.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","They haven't changed too much from previous reports. We do see first time renewal rates being a little lower in emerging markets, whether those be markets in Asia Pacific or India or Greater Asia markets than we do here domestically. But we continue to see strength in the previously renewed names.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Just one more, could you talk about your new DNS firewall product and how it's been received so far?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. It's a fairly new product so it's a bit early to give you any real detail on financial detail. But we can tell you that the reception is good in the market. There is tremendous interest in it. Most large enterprises and virtually all ISPs do operate their own recursive servers. And we operate a recursive service as well. The market feedback that we received was that a firewall would be a very, very welcome and important aspect of that to give these customers more precise control over filtering access using the DNS as essentially as another layer to prevent malware, which is of course something that's on everybody's mind these days.","So I would certainly say that the initial response from the market is good. There's tremendous interest, particularly in the firewall aspect of this recursive service. And so, we're certainly hoping for success for the product. But it's early to really give you any more detail than that. But specifically to answer your question, the initial reception is a strong interest and very much so, specifically, in the firewall aspect.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We go next to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. There seems to be more volatility in net adds activity over the past six to nine months than anything we've seen probably over the past five plus years. And I know there's been recent promotional activity that's on and off, but that's always been the case in some fashion at least. And so, I'm just wondering if there's anything that you would kind of point to that might be driving some of the volatility in net adds from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Gregg, this is George. I mean, there are many, many factors that happen inter-quarter or inter-year with domain names. Clearly, we have varying growth rates in markets around the world. As I mentioned last quarter and it holds true for this quarter as well, we still see more growth internationally than we do domestic. Our Asia, in general, markets are growing much faster. But as far as the individual nuances for the net zone, some of those factors harken back to promotions that registrars may have run a year ago, and their respective renewal rates and effectiveness of those programs.","Other issues may go to programs running this year that are driving net adds. And so, it's really a confluence of obviously adds and deletes. You're probably seeing more volatility only in the sense that the net adds in each quarter from several years ago are smaller than they used to be or they are currently.","But we saw 500,000 net adds in the second quarter. As you can see our guidance, we're expecting just like last year the third quarter to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. And we still see strong demand for our product globally.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, George. And just one follow-up if I could on dot-net names, so the attrition of dot-net did pick up a little bit in Q2. Obviously, you're going to be raising pricing by 10% in February of next year. And just wondering if there are kind of any concerns that you might have around price elasticity for dot.net? Thank you.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. I mean, we still believe that the dot.net product is a very fairly priced asset in the marketplace. We look at a lot of the competitors who are priced higher than we are. We think there's a lot of value in that brand. And yes dot.net's growth has been a little bit muted. But as we talked about, you have to keep in mind there's been over 700 new competitors entering the marketplace, a lot of those targeting \u2013 clearly, targeting both the com and net and the other legacy gTLDs. But clearly, net probably has been more affected than com has, even though I think they've been both targeted from competitors.","But net has held up very well. We think the product is quite well priced in the marketplace, and fairly priced for the value of asset that we're delivering and the value of product. So, we expect net to continue to perform.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets","Thanks. Afternoon, everybody. I guess this might be for Pat. In your dot \u2013 or I'm sorry, in your dot brand customer base that you're working with, what's your sense of how they're thinking about it from the perspective of are they going to move from dot-com to .xyz or whatever? Or are they more thinking that this will be an incremental domain?","Patrick S. Kane - VeriSign, Inc.","So, not all of our brand customers have determined exactly how they are going to use their top level domains. But we would imagine that some would complement their current dot-com with their own offering, but we don't see them abandoning their dot-com.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","And just to clarify, this is Jim, I'm not sure what you meant by your question, but there can be two answers to that. Number one is the way you put it, I assume you meant dot brand where customers may take their own. And I think Pat is right. So, for example, if we were to employ dot-verisign, we would never abandon verisign.com. We've, like most brands, we've invested heavily in promoting it and everybody is familiar with it. And it would simply \u2013 we would probably redirect traffic from one to the other. We'd never abandon it. And since we run the registry for \u2013 we would be running the registry for both dot-com and for dot-verisign, for us, it's the same reliable platform.","But we do see \u2013 we are aware of some brands who \u2013 in fact, most of the dot brands that have applied, many of them are our backend registry customers. So they're not only keeping their dot-com, but they're also moving their dot brand onto our platform to make sure that it runs on the same reliable 18 years of 100% availability infrastructure that we operate.","At this point, I think the traffic for anybody in dot-com is so valuable that I don't see anybody abandoning their dot-com for either a brand or another TLD.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets","No. So the answer shortly, I guess, it's largely incremental as opposed to cannibalizing dot-com?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, I think if you just look at the numbers for dot-com and the net adds, you'll see that being the powerful brand that it is, it's still growing quite briskly. So I think those numbers speak for themselves. Dot-com is the reliable brand and people are choosing great names in it and the registration numbers are strong. It's in demand and people are registering dot-coms and, of course, needless to say, all of the global brands are on dot-com and I don't expect that to change.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for any additional or any closing remarks.","David Atchley - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, operator.

With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; George Kilguss, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Pat Kane, Senior Vice President, Naming Services.","This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our website, www.verisigninc.com. There, you will also find our first quarter 2014 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.

Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate a good start to 2014. We reported revenue of $249 million, which was 5% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $130 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 1.28 million net new names, bringing our name base to a total of 128.5 million active .com and .net domain names. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus in and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business.","As part of managing our business, during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.4 million shares for $132 million. At the end of the first quarter, $868 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","Before I get into the first quarter results, I want to provide updates on a few areas from the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we intend to repatriate between $700 million and $800 million of cash, held by foreign subsidiaries, to the U.S. At that time, we had also indicated our expectation was that this would be done in either the second or third quarter of 2014. And I'm pleased to inform you that we now believe this repatriation will happen sooner and will be completed during the second quarter of 2014.","During the first quarter, additional new generic top-level domains were delegated into the root zone. As you'll recall, VeriSign applied for 14 new generic top-level domains. 12 of these applications are internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. We applied for 2 IDN transliterations of .com in Chinese, both simplified and traditional Chinese, which are variants of each other. ICANN placed these 2 .com IDN applications in a string similarity contention set because they are variants, and subsequently, requested that we withdraw one of the applications until ICANN could address its policy on variance. For now, we have withdrawn our application for the transliteration of the .com IDN string in traditional Chinese.","With the Chinese variant contention set behind us, we are now ready to engage in the negotiating and contracting process with ICANN on our remaining 13 applications.","Also, as an update, we do expect one of our back-end registry customers to launch their top-level domain during the second quarter. We will provide further updates as appropriate regarding the status of our applications and the status of back-end registry customers.","On our innovation and patent programs, we do have progress updates. First, we talked about contracting for a pilot with a large firm for the use of an innovative new product service, which we have developed. The contracting for that pilot was completed earlier this year, and the pilot is underway.","Second, there is an update on our patent program. We are beginning to receive inquiries from registry operators about using some elements of our patented registry technology. And as you may have seen, we joined with Juniper Networks in the quarter to provide multilevel optimized protection from diverse types of DDoS attacks. The new offering can provide highly scalable, always-on DDoS protection by moving mitigation from Juniper's on-premise DDoS Secure appliance to VeriSign's higher-capacity, cloud-based DDoS Protection Service. Further, VeriSign and Juniper plan to develop and promote open-source standards for communications between on-premise and cloud-based DDoS protection. No delivery dates or forecast for these activities are provided at this time, but will be announced as available.","During the first quarter, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to begin a process to transition to the global stakeholder community its oversight of what is called the IANA functions and related root zone management functions, which, principally, include processing changes to the root zone like the addition to the root of new top-level domain names, as well as oversight of the IP address base.","VeriSign makes changes to the root zone that are approved by NTIA, including adding new gTLDs, and then publishes the zone file as part of its Root Zone Maintainer role, which we have performed without compensation, spanning 3 decades. This function is independent from, and not related to, our contracts with ICANN to manage the .com and .net registries.","As we stated in our March 17 news release, the announcement by NTIA does not affect VeriSign's operation of the .com and .net registries. The announcement does not impact VeriSign's .com or .net domain name business, nor impact its .com or .net revenue, or those agreements which have presumptive rights of renewal.","I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 128.5 million, consisting of 113.2 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 4% year-over-year. In the first quarter, we added 1.28 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.6 million new gross registrations.","In the fourth quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 72.2% compared with 72.9% for the fourth quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.6%. This rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the first quarter of 2013.","As we discussed last quarter, while there are many factors that drive zone growth, changes to certain domestic and international registrar marketing tactics have had a near-term moderating impact on the zone, as they are focused on increasing bundled product offerings rather than on driving domain name sales, and have been running fewer discount programs on new domains. While it's too early to say for how long or how much this factor may affect zone growth, we still see it impacting registration growth in the second quarter.","By the way, since we discussed this during our February earnings call, we have seen some refocus by certain registers -- registrars back to customer acquisition and discount programs.","Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, the overall renewal rate has been softer, primarily due to the lower renewal rates for first-time renewing names. Given our forecast for zone growth, including the factors just discussed, we expect .com and .net names added to the zone in the second quarter of 2014 to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names, and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. I'm sorry, wrong page there. Seem to be a little out of sync.","There we go. Sorry. Last sentence was we expect common net names added to the zone in the second quarter of 2014 to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $249 million, up 5% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $140 million, up 4.7% from $133 million in the first quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.1% compared to 56.4% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $94 million compared to $85 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 in the first quarter this year compared with $0.52 for the first quarter last year.","As of March 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion, which included $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Liabilities totaled $3.1 billion at the quarter end. Of the $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $192 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally.","I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are: revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2014 full-year guidance.","As mentioned, revenue totaled $249 million for the first quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $886 million, a $30 million increase from year-end 2013. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million compared with $106 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $96 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in the expense is primarily a result of timing differences related to implementation of certain planned marketing programs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter expanded to 60.1% compared to 59.6% in the same quarter of 2013.","Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $95 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.64 compared to $0.58 in the first quarter of 2013 and $0.65 last quarter.","With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. In 2014, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $50 million, which primarily relate to international taxes, including withholding tax on our intended repatriation.","We had a weighted average diluted share count of 149 million shares in the first quarter compared to 150 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.3 million shares, based on the average share price during the first quarter, compared with 7.9 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2.4 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.","Operating cash flow was $142 million for the first quarter compared to $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $150 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was $130 million.","With respect to our 2014, our full-year guidance includes updates to our revenue and capital expenditure projections. Revenue for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.015 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 5%. This is a change from the $1 billion to $1.02 billion, or growth rate of 4% to 6%, as given on our last earnings call.","Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full-year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 58% and 60%, as we expect sales and marketing spend to accelerate in future quarters.","Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $73 million and $77 million for 2014. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $50 million and $70 million, changed from the $60 million to $80 million range given on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, the company demonstrated sound financial performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with the first quarter of 2013. We have maintained a strong balance sheet, and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. During the first quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business. We have protected our business by providing over 16 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS, and this month celebrated the company's 19th year. This track record is due to the strength and experience of our people, our commitment to excellence, and our specialized and purpose-built infrastructure. Our innovation efforts support our goals to drive profitable growth through the development of new products and services.","And finally, we've been managing the business effectively, as demonstrated by our improved operating margins and delivery of value to shareholders through share repurchases during the first quarter. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders.","We will now take your questions, and operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jim, in your prepared remarks, you touched upon the NTIA and the transfer of the IANA contract, we still -- we heard your prepared remarks, but we still get a number of questions, people wondering, the next time that .com comes up for renewal, for example, is there any additional risk that this change would actually add in terms of any possibility that you would lose the contract?","D. James Bidzos","Thanks for that question, Sterling. Yes, we get some questions, too. I think there's confusion because of just similar technology, but the best way I can describe it is to simply say these are entirely separate, they're entirely unrelated, and whatever plays out in NTIA's intent to exit IANA and transition this to ICANN is an entirely separate process. I know that there are some politics that swirl around it as well. But the bottom line is that the .com and .net contracts are entirely separate. They're separate agreements, they stand alone and nothing is has changed since those contracts were signed, meaning that the only we would lose those contracts is if we breach those contracts and fail to cure it. All of this activity swirling around IANA has no impact whatsoever on it. And I guess, I'm not sure how to be more clear than that, but that's the best description I can give you. So in a word, if your question is, how can all this IANA stuff impact our common net renewals, the answer is naught.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I think part of where people are coming from is, is this a sign that U.S., as a government, is relinquishing control? And if you had international stakeholders more in influenced positions with ICANN, could it somehow change what would happen to the contracting process the next time?","D. James Bidzos","Well, the contract survived any assignment or termination. Our obligation survived, ICANN or its successors' obligations survived. So our obligation to perform and their obligation to renew if we perform all survived. So all of those politics, all of those potential changes. Also, if you watch the hearings, you saw the testimony of Larry Strickling from NTIA and Fadi Chehad\u00e9, ICANN's CEO, they both testified that there will not be a transition without appropriate safeguards. ICANN is not leaving the U.S. And so I think, those are just simply further indications that these -- that what NTIA said, that it is really transitioning what it believes is a clerical role, is the way that it sees this. So we have a long way to go while these safeguards are developed, but given that and given the standalone protected nature of all of the registry agreements, including common net, I just don't see a scenario where there's any impact on these contracts. They are completely separate.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And maybe one last follow-up question. Looking at the .net additions to the zone and the guidance for the June quarter, from your perspective, do you think that the new gTLD program is starting to have an impact on the growth of the .com\/.net zone?","D. James Bidzos","Well there are a lot of factors that affect the zone. They're all the things that we've been talking about for some time. Obviously, the changes that [indiscernible] for them is the changes in PPC, the law of large numbers as the zone grows and also, these behavioral changes in registrars that we've talked about. Now having said that, additionally, there are roughly 100 -- over 100 new gTLDs that are delegated into the zone, and they're accepting registrations right now, and have been pretty much for most of the first quarter, for roughly almost 3 months now. And in total, there are about 570,000 registrations in, collectively, all of the new gTLDs year-to-date. I think that information is current as of just a couple of days ago. So it's too soon to tell if any of those registrations or what part of those registrations are at the expense of a .com or a .net registration, because until we see the first renewal cycle on these new gTLDs, it's really going to be difficult to assess how much impact they might have on the .com\/.net zone.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next call comes from Steve Ashley, W -- Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just maybe to follow up on Sterling's comment here regarding -- and you -- Jim, you did a very nice job with just touching on all of the things that have been impacting the pace of domain name growth, with the behavioral change of the registrar, the algorithm changes, law of large numbers, is it your hope or would it be your expectation that at some point in future, we could see the growth rate of the zone reaccelerate and get stronger? Not asking for a timeframe, just conceptually, is it possible that we could see an acceleration in growth down the road at some point?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I think what we can say and that we said last quarter, and I'll let George add some comments to this, but our models, which we have a fair amount of confidence in, were fairly good in giving us the basis for our first quarter guidance. They do show that second quarter is a little bit weaker, and they do show recovery in the third and fourth quarter. I did mention also that since February, we have seen a return to focus on new-unit acquisition and discount programs by some of the registrars. So I think it's early to tell if that's a trend. But I think, given all those -- and the fact that we did see 8.6 million gross adds during the quarter in .com and .net says that there's still very strong activity and strong registrations. So certainly, in terms of future zone growth, I'm very confident. George, did you want to add anything to that?","George E. Kilguss","Yes. Steve, the only other commentary I would provide you is, if you recall our guidance that we gave on our last call, we talked about a zone growth of 2% to 4% in 2014. And that's still our expectation for 2013. As Jim mentioned, there are many factors that impact us inter-quarter, but in totality, we're really looking at a zone growth of between 2% and 4% for 2014.","D. James Bidzos","Yes. I guess, put another way, we're essentially see -- we're certainly not changing our full-year 2014 guidance.","Operator","And next is Fred Ziegel from Topeka Capital Markets.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A question on the non-domain business, what's the status there? When are we doing? There's an awful lot of activity in DDoS, and I know you know that with Juniper, but what -- can you give us an update on kind of the products schedule in that part of the business, which I know is a small piece at the moment?","D. James Bidzos","Yes, we don't break it out separately, as you know. I don't have any updates specific to any particular product schedule. Juniper did make a detailed press release, and you can look there for indications from their perspective on this particular partnership. And I did provide the 3 updates. We did get to the signing of a pilot agreement with a large firm that we're conducting a pilot with. I did mention some activity in patents. On the Juniper thing, I think one of the interesting aspects of that particular announcement is that it's quite different and interesting, in a sense that it's a hybrid solution, and it matches both our in-cloud DDoS mitigation service and Juniper's own on-premise equipment DDoS mitigation offering. And certainly, the DDoS market is growing. It's an area where companies are very concerned, and they're making investments. So I'd look at this as an indication that 2 companies that are major players in that market are getting together to try to provide a more optimized offering against more specialized attacks. So I think at this point, the only update that we can give you is that we've partnered with someone to address what we think is a growing market. Beyond that, unfortunately, we just can't say more at this point.","Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Are you applying more resources, people, R&D to the non-domain part of the business, given the slowdown in net adds?","D. James Bidzos","Well, I -- let me try to answer your question this way. When we put together our plans for 2014, we baked in investments in a number of growth initiatives. And those are fully funded, and we're executing and investing in those growth initiatives. And so all of our guidance contains all of that. We don't expect to change that. So to the extent we've planned for and budgeted for growth initiatives, we are absolutely spending that money where we're making those investments. We've made our bets, we've chosen our innovation programs, we've chosen our new products and services to pursue, and we're pursuing those. And so we're staffing and funding those programs.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And as a final -- I'm sorry, Walter Pritchard from Citibank.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just on the guidance, the operating margin guidance, 58% to 60%, you're running at the high end of the range right now. You've had a history of outperforming on the margin side, and you're also talking a bit about some spending in the second half. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of that margin guide. Why shouldn't we see you sort of hold this margin at 60% through the year? And then just had a follow-up question around some of the specific spending.","George E. Kilguss","Yes. Sure, Walter. This is George Kilguss. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have some marketing expense that pushed into later quarters. Basically, as I've talked about, we put a little bit more rigor around evaluating some of our marketing programs. Today, we do quite a bit of marketing through registrars, and they actually give us joint marketing proposals, which we evaluate. And as we're looking at those to see if we think they're good for us driving profitable growth, we put some more rigor and analysis around those. And that has actually caused a little bit of a slip to just some of the approval of those programs. And so some of those have slipped into Q2 and subsequent quarters. I would say, approximately, about $4 million or so of spend -- we expected to spend in marketing have slipped out the first quarter. And I would say, a fair bit of that will go into the second quarter, but some have slipped to the previous quarters. So again, it's really a timing difference. We do continue to have desires to invest further in sales and marketing, and we're doing that, we're trying to do that in a measured way. And so as a result of that timing difference, we're still keeping the same guidance between 58% and 60% for the full year of non-GAAP operating margin.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it, George. And then just following up on that a little bit. On the -- it sounds like you did have some registrars get a bit more aggressive on marketing spend -- or at least, on promotional activity marketing spend. I'm assuming that's more their own -- under their own choice or their own investment. I'm wondering, as you think about deploying more marketing dollars into the field and second -- especially in the second half of the year, is that what the driver is in terms of you believing that the zone file will stabilize and improve in terms of growth? And could you just remind us of the factors you think will drive that improvement?","George E. Kilguss","Yes. So we made comments last quarter that we saw some registrars go for more ARPU-type of activity than they did for using domain name registrations to acquire customers. And we talked about domestic and international registrars both having that tactic. As Jim mentioned, we did see -- there's still some, particularly U.S. registrars, that are still keeping out with that ARPU strategy, but we have seen some of the international registrars regroup and go back to more of trying to acquire customers using domain names as their method to do it. So more of a customer acquisition. So we have seen a little bit of a change in that behavior. We also talked in the last call that in January, we saw a little softness from emerging markets in the month of January, particularly around China. Now post-January and post our fourth quarter call, we've actually seen a pickup in some of the emerging-market activity, particularly in China. We saw February and March be relatively strong in those markets. And so we're clearly looking for those markets to continue to perform there, but again, there's a number of confluence of factors that are going on that we mentioned there. But we still believe that our zone will grow between 2% and 4% in 2014.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","We noticed that a couple of your larger registrars are running $0.99-first-year .com promotions in the recent months, and just kind of wondering if that was able to stimulate some decent level of demand in the quarter and they may be a partial offset to some of the bundling and some of the going-after-ARPU dynamics that you guys had pointed out?","George E. Kilguss","So Gregg, this is George. We definitely saw some of our registrars retarget domain names as a customer-acquisition vehicle. They were doing some discounting there. And I think they've seen some improved results from that. But not all registrars have adopted that. Some registrars have done variance of that where they may have to do something called retargeted or targeted price discounting, where maybe if you come back to their site multiple times, you might get a lower price, depending on your interest. But clearly, internationally, we have seen some registrars go back to discounting, and that has helped net registrations.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, George. And then just one follow-up, wondering if you happen to the number of names up for renewal in the Q2?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, I can get that for you. So it's 27.5 million.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I'm sorry, George, I didn't catch that.","George E. Kilguss","27.5 million.","Operator","And we will take our last question from Priya Parasuraman from Wells Fargo.","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This is actually Priya for Gray. I was wondering if you have any more color on the Chinese IDN transliteration, which you talked about in your prepared remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Okay, I'm sorry, I had trouble hearing. The very last part of your question was about the Chinese IDN?","Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I was wondering if you could provide any more color on that, and if that could be reinstated or is that temporary?","D. James Bidzos","Yes. So let me just describe what happened there. So basically, ICANN's policy was not prepared to address the situation where a single applicant had a variant. We had communications with ICANN going back over a year. Early on, they advised that we file separate applications until they sorted out their policy. They have not sorted out that policy as of this time. And so the simple way to move forward was to withdraw one and move forward with the other, which we've done. However, when they do sort out that policy, we expect that new policy to mirror their ccTLD policy, which does allow for these multiple variants. And so yes, hopefully, we will have the opportunity to reinstate and bring in the other Chinese IDN. But this, at least, allows us a way forward with the traditional Chinese IDN and it also allows us to move forward with contracting for the other 12. So for a total of 13 IDNs, transliterations of .com and .net, we are now engaging in the contracting process with ICANN. And I have Pat here as well, who's a little closer to all this. If you wanted to add anything, Pat?","Patrick S. Kane","The only thing that I would add, Jim, is that when we chose between the Traditional and the Simplified Chinese variant, we chose to retain the Simplified and withdraw the Traditional because the Simplified Chinese is the bigger marketplace.","D. James Bidzos","Yes. I hope that answers your question.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator.

Please go ahead, sir.","David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.","This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited. And our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure.","The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which capped another solid year for VeriSign. The year marked some significant milestones for the Internet community and for VeriSign with the completion of the IANA transition, our signing of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement with ICANN, and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment, which extends the .com Registry Agreement until the end of November 2024.","Our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. During 2016, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1.142 billion in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $666 million, and producing full-year 2016 non-GAAP operating margins of 64.5%.","Operationally, 2016 was a solid year for the company. VeriSign processed 35.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations, and finished the year with 142.2 million .com and .net names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 19 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.","As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2 million shares for $160 million. During the full year 2016, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $637 million. Effective today, the board of directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $641 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration.","Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the year. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business, and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases.","At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.2 million, consisting of 126.9 million names for .com and 15.3 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 1.7% year-over-year.","As noted in prior conference calls, the fourth quarter of 2016 was somewhat unique, as the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter had a larger than normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations due to the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 2015, coming from China investors. As first-time renewing names have a lower renewal rate than previously renewed names, fourth quarter 2016 deletes were elevated and resulted in the domain name base decrease of 1.9 million net names after processing 8.8 million new gross registrations during the quarter.","This larger percentage of first-time renewing names is also leading to an overall preliminary fourth quarter 2016 renewal rate of 67.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73% compared with 71.9% for the same quarter of 2015.","While activity from China has normalized over the last few quarters, the China names surge of late 2015 declined, but did carry over into the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we expect this small group of names to contribute to a slight increase in deletes towards the end of the current Q1 and the beginning of Q2. Based on these and other factors, we expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 0.5% and 2.5%, with an increase to the domain name base of between 0.7 million and 1.2 million registrations in the first quarter.","Now I'd like to provide two updates before handing the call over to George. First, as it relates to our becoming the registry operator for .web, on January 18, 2017, the company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, requesting certain information related to VeriSign's potential operations of the .web TLD. The CID is not directed at VeriSign's existing registry agreements.","As we said at the time of the auction last July, we strongly believe VeriSign is well-positioned to grow and widely distribute .web to provide an additional option to the marketplace, given our proven track record of reliability and stability, and we look forward to explaining our views as we respond to the CID and continue to cooperate with the DOJ.","Second, we continually evaluate the strategic opportunities for our business and, as you may have seen earlier today, we have decided it is in the best interests to sell our iDefense business to Accenture. As part of this sale, VeriSign will continue as an iDefense customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense.","The announcement of the iDefense sale only relates to iDefense and is not a sale of our other VeriSign security services offerings, including DDoS Protection and Managed DNS. The terms of this transaction are not being disclosed and the financials associated with this business are not material to our overall business. We anticipate closing in the next few months, subject to customary closing conditions.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1.142 billion, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015, and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $286 million, up 5% year-over-year and down 0.4% sequentially. The small sequential decline was a result of the 1.9 million reduction in the domain name base during the quarter that Jim discussed earlier.","During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $169 million, up 6.6% from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago.","GAAP net income totaled $106 million compared to $102 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter last year. As of December 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $368 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.","I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance.","Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $14 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to $100 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was primarily a result of increased marketing expenses deployed in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 63.9% compared to 62.4% in the same quarter of 2015.","Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $115 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 125.5 million shares. This compares to $0.79 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.93 last quarter, based on 133.4 million and 127.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.","Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 20.6 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter, compared with 21.4 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 20.8 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was $195 million and free cash flow was $198 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $189 million and $176 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year.","With respect to full year 2017 guidance, the financial guidance that I will provide reflects the expected completion of the iDefense asset sale within the next few months.","Revenue for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $1.138 billion to $1.158 billion. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million.","Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And finally, cash taxes for the year are expected to be between $15 million and $25 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2017 are international, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures.","These convertible debentures continue to generate cash tax benefits while they remain outstanding, and they are an important part of our capital structure. Although we will have the right to redeem these debentures under the terms of the indentures starting in August of 2017, our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefit to continue to accrue.","In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2016.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, George. In closing, during the last year, we expanded our work to protect, grow, and manage the business, while continuing our focus to provide long-term value to our shareholders. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.","We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will take our first question from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. Close enough there. Hi, guys. First question, you mentioned the Q4 renewal rates are expected to be 67.5%. Was there any change in renewal rates outside of China in the quarter?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Gregg, thanks for the question. In general, our renewal rates both domestically and internationally have been relatively consistent with one another. But the vast majority of the decline that we saw in our international renewal rates is really related to the China names. That was the biggest factor. Everything else stayed relatively consistent for us.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thanks, George. And then, within the Q1 net add guidance, are you assuming essentially the same renewal rates from China that you saw in Q4?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. For the group of names that are similar \u2013 the group of names \u2013 it was about 750,000 to 1 million names that came in in the first quarter of 2016 that was also from, what we believe to be, the China investor phenomena. We expect those to have similar renewal rates as the names that renewed in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Perfect. And then just a couple other quick ones, if I may. I understand and certainly can appreciate that you don't want to get overly granular with respect to the iDefense contribution. Having said that, the 2017 revenue guidance is below where the Street was, and just \u2013 I think any sort of additional color you might be able to provide, even if not getting, again, overly granular, might just be helpful in sort of reconciling where the Street was previously versus your guidance today.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. I think there're a variety of factors that go into our revenue guidance, which is $1.138 billion to $1.158 billion for next year. Clearly, we had a very strong 2016, we were up 7.8% in 2016 versus 4.9% in 2015. And as we've talked about, a lot of that revenue growth was from a unique event, which was attributed to the strong China investor community. And as we've mentioned, about a third of those names renewed in the fourth quarter.","So we do have some names, as I just mentioned, coming up in the first quarter that should, if they had the same renewal rate, will delete out of the zone sometime in the late first quarter, early second quarter. And so that's part of what's influencing it. Also to a lesser extent, you're correct, the iDefense business, we expect that revenue to get out of the business as we close this transaction. And so without disclosing any details on the iDefense business, which we're not, I would say it's really those two factors that are giving our view of revenue today, and as always we'll update our guidance each quarter as we get more visibility into the year.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, great. And then just one last one for Jim, just following-up on the Civil Investigative Demand from the DOJ with respect to .web. What would be the sort of the procedure and timeline from here just as you understand it? Thanks.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Sure. Well, I think in my comments I not only said all I should. I think I said all there really is to say at this point. There's no information beyond what I told you. I can give you a little bit more color, I guess. We've certainly said in the past that inorganic growth is part of our growth strategy, and sometimes regulatory review becomes part of that process. So we received the CID, which is kind of like a subpoena. We've been discussing it with the DOJ since shortly after we received it, and we've provided some information already and we're continuing to cooperate. So like I said in my remarks, we believe we're well positioned to grow .web. We think that the industry is extremely competitive. Beyond that, it's just too early in the process to say anything beyond that. It's just speculation and I really can't do that.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC","Fair enough. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","We will take our next question from Gray Powell of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Just a couple questions, if I may. So it looks like .com is showing a decent recovery in growth over the last month, but .net does remain under some pressure. Is there any residual churn issue on .net or should we just expect more muted growth there on that domain going forward?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Well, .net was also impacted by the China activity in 2015, and so we did see some of .net names also churn out of the zone in the fourth quarter of 2016. The .net is still a great brand for us globally. It's well-recognized. It continues to do well in markets internationally, as well as domestically. But there is a lot of choice in the domain name industry, and there is clearly competition, whether it be from ccTLDs or other technologies. But we still are looking to drive demand in .net, and it's still a great brand for us globally.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Certainly, .net is not the brand that .com is. Com is a stronger brand, but there are 15.3 million .net registrations. It's a globally recognized and a trusted brand. It had, in the past couple of years, actually dipped briefly below 15 million names, and it's recovered. So I think its growth trajectory is just a little bit different than .com, but it's still a very, very strong and recognized brand. It's the second largest generic TLD behind com.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Understood. Okay. That's helpful. And then could you give an update on foreign language versions of .com and .net that you're introducing? Just how many are up and running today? What kind of traction are they seeing? And then, just what's the schedule for the remaining domains going forward?","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Todd, do you want to...","Todd B. Strubbe - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we currently have three of the transliterations of com and net generally available. That's two of the Korean or Hangul transliterations, one for com and one for net, and then the Japanese or Katakana script of .com. At this point, we're not providing any additional details on other launches. As we mentioned last quarter, we do continue to work on our licensing process to operate the Chinese IDNs, and we will update as we develop our plans further.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is (21:43) in for Sterling. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask as a follow-up on the iDefense sale. Can you talk a little more about the timing and the rationale of the sale, and if there are any plans for divesting the securities business? And then also my second question is just on other revenue in the quarter. It seems a little bit higher than what we expected. So if there is anything else driving that? Any color there would be really helpful. Thank you.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","I don't know if you're on a cell phone. The very end of that was a little difficult to understand. You said that other revenue was a little bit higher in the quarter, and then you said something else that I think at least I wasn't able to get.","Unknown Speaker","Can you \u2013 is it better now?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","A little.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah, a little. Try again, please. I got your first question.","Unknown Speaker","I was just asking about the other revenue, if anything (22:43) if anything was different this quarter.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Okay.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","So let me address your first question about iDefense. I think you were asking about strategic rationale. We've certainly said consistently that we are certainly better suited to be a consumer rather than a producer of threat intelligence. Our primary business is, obviously, the secure and stable operation of infrastructure supporting .com and .net. That's our primary mission. That's the most important thing that we do.","We, obviously, need good cyber defenses in order to do that, but we will continue to be an iDefense customer and receive it, but it's a little different than the other security services. And as I mentioned in my remarks, this is specifically iDefense. It's not our Managed DNS business and it's not our DDoS Protection businesses. So I think it's just sort of a logical sort of business procession for us. Your other question was about other revenue, and I'll ask George maybe to address that.","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. So, there was nothing unusual in the quarter. I'm not sure how your models track our revenue performance, but nothing unusual from an other revenue perspective.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah. If I can just throw out some additional color for you. I mean, we've had, as you know, a number of different growth initiatives and we did monetize some patents in 2016 and we expect to do so in 2017 as well. But the amount is not material. We've adjusted our growth efforts to align with a rapidly changing domain name market. Some of those changes include shifts in traditional channels for domain names, possible secondary market activity and corresponding changes to how we invest in marketing. So, while we're planning to realize 2017 revenue from these other efforts, we don't expect it to be material and none of it's in our guidance.","Operator","We will take our final question from Jason Velkavrh of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you for taking my questions. The first question is on the expense side. I believe last quarter you mentioned an intent to put a little more money to work in sales and marketing. I was just hoping you could provide some more color around this. And if that took place this quarter, sort of what initiatives that is going towards?","George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Jason, I'd be happy to. So if you looked at the quarter from a non-GAAP basis, we had about $103 million of expenses in the quarter. That was up about $3 million from the third quarter, where we had about $100 million. And the majority, if not all of that increase, was spent in the marketing area. We continue to partner with our registrars to put more marketing dollars in various markets to drive domain name growth. And so we were able to put that money to work and we continue to look to opportunities to partner with registrars to do that in markets that we think can drive profitable growth for us.","Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then a question on the new gTLDs, the .com, .net transliterations. Realized it's a small base and early, but just curious there. What are you seeing there in terms of renewal rates for those that have lapsed versus what you see for .com and .net?","Todd B. Strubbe - VeriSign, Inc.","We haven't really \u2013 the general availability for the earliest ones was not until second quarter of 2016, so we're not up to our first year.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah, we haven't lapped yet.","Todd B. Strubbe - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah, don't have (26:30)","Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. Do you have an expectation for that to be any different or do you expect that to be around the same?","Todd B. Strubbe - VeriSign, Inc.","I think it's too early to tell. They are such a different product.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Yeah, we don't guide to the renewal rates, but there is only a few more months and that information will be available.","Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. That's all I had. Thanks for the questions.","D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. David Atchley for final comments.","David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.","Thank you, operator.

Today's conference is being recorded. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.","At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's third quarter 2019 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About Verisign on verisign.com. There you will also find our third quarter 2019 earnings release.","At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail on our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through public disclosure.","The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Our results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.","At the end of September, the domain name base in dot-com and net totaled 157.1 million, consisting of 144 million names for dot-com and 13.4 million names for dot-net with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%.","During the third quarter, we processed 9.9 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.27 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.6%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.8% achieved in the third quarter of 2018.","For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3.2% and 3.7 %. As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in a process with ICANN to incorporate the terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into our dot-com registry agreement.","For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 amendment to our com registry agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the agreement, we and ICANN also agree to negotiate in good faith to do two things; first, we agree to reflect changes to the Cooperative Agreement in the com agreement, including pricing terms. Second, we agree to amend the com agreement to include terms to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the com registry or the Internet.","We believe these discussions with ICANN are nearly complete. While it will be inappropriate at this time to provide more details, I can say that we were satisfied with the results so far. As noted, this is an ICANN process and we expect that before long ICANN will be publishing for public comment the documents we have been discussing.","During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares of common stock for $194 million. Our financial position remained strong with $1.23 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. we continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George Kilguss","Thank you, Jim and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million up 0.9% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year ago. The small sequential quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of the timing of spend related to some sales and marketing programs.","Year-over-year the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the sale of our Security Services business, as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. Operating income totaled $206 million compared with $195 million in the third quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 66.7% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago.","Net income totaled $154 million compared to $138 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.30 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.13 for the same quarter last year. As of September 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $511 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.","I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full-year guidance.","As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation totaled $90 million compared to $91 million last quarter and $96 million in the third quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 70.8% compared to 70.1% last quarter and 68.7% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $161 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.36 based on a weighted average diluted share count of $118.6 million shares. This compares to $1.33 last quarter and $1.23 in the third quarter of 2018.","Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $208 million and free cash flow was $197 million compared with the $187 million and $177 million respectively for the third quarter last year. Beginning with the first quarter 2020 earnings results, we plan to eliminate our discussion and presentation of non-GAAP measures with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA on which we will continue to report. As a result, our full-year 2020 guidance, which we will provide on our next call, will only include GAAP metrics. This change is the culmination of the declining trend and influence of our non-GAAP adjustments over the last several years and is consistent with the evolving trends and best practices in financial reporting.","Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.228 billion to $1.233 million narrowed from the $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. This revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full-year 2019 of between 3.2% and 3.7%.","Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 69.5% and 70% increased and narrowed from the 68% to 69% range provided on our last call. Our interest expense and non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $44 million to $49 million narrowed from the $42 million to $49 million range provided on our last call.","Capital expenditures in 2019 are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $95 million narrowed from the $85 million to $100 million range provided previously.","To recap, Verisign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2019.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Bidzos","Thanks George. The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and year-over-year revenue growth we generated and efficiently returned value to our shareholders. We continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders.","And we'll now take your questions. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Rob Oliver with Baird.","MattLemenager","Good afternoon. It is Matt Lemenager on for Rob. I appreciate the comments around the ICANN Registry Agreement negotiation. So when -- as we look forward, could you remind us once the public comment period would open up, what does the timeline look like after that? I believe you have to give a six-month notification period before making you can make any formal changes in pricing. So I assume that entire review period with ICANN would be complete by kind of the April 2020 would kind of be the timeframe that it would need to be completed by? But could you just remind us what the timeline looks like after the public comment period opens?","James Bidzos","Sure Matt. Yes, let me explain how what we expect in the public comment period with the caveat that this is an ICANN process, so I can't speak with certainty and I don't speak for ICANN, but I kind of tell you what the expectation is and what they typically do. As I mentioned, we will expect them to shortly publish these documents for comment.","Comment period, ICANN's comment periods are typically about 40 days. There is typically a short period where they review the comments and then after that it's normally expected that some action would be taken on approval on that process. Again, it's ICANN process, I can't tell you with certainty, but that's typically what they do and that's basically an expectation based on what they've done in the past.","In terms of any price increases, we don't guide to pricing. We need to finalize this ICANN process first. So I can't offer you any details on that, but hopefully that answered your question.","Matt Lemenager","Yes, that's helpful. And then another one on kind of the newer initiatives I suppose, is there any update to dot-web and the process there?","James Bidzos","Yes, actually there is some new information since we spoke to you last quarter on dot-web. Just for the benefit, I guess if everybody else on the call for context, there was an auction for dot-web and one of the losing bidders, a company called Afilias, a competitor of ours, filed what is a form of an arbitration proceeding called an IRP in November 2018. That's against ICANN and as a reminder ICANN filed a response to the complaint. We're not a party to that arbitration, but we have filed a request asking to participate in that arbitration as an interested party, which is allowed by ICANN's rules.","So the update is that since last quarter, kind of a significant update I guess is that an arbitration panel has been appointed, convened. It actually held a hearing just very recently, a couple of weeks ago on our request to request to participate, that hearing was held and we expect a ruling on that issue of our participation before the end of the year.","Matt Lemenager","Okay, got it. And then lastly just on the sales and marketing expense, is down 28% every year, I think it is a couple close in a row that has declined. I mean, do you -- is there any expectation, would that go, just trying to take the bottom [ph] of that out into 2020 it seems like with that level off at some point as we kind of do dot-web and put marketing dollars behind that, or anything, if you could give any color around the sales and marketing expense?","George Kilguss","Yes, sure Matt, this is George. So, as mentioned in my prepared remarks, the big change in expense year-over-year really is a result of sale of our VSS business. As it relates to sales and marketing, there was -- most of that expense came out of sales and marketing year-over-year. So that's primarily the year-over-year decline. As far as where sales and marketing is going in the future, we will provide -- we don\u2019t provide guidance on the individual segments, but we will give you an idea of our expectation for next year on our call in February.","Matt Lemenager","Okay, got it, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Let's start with the renewal rate in the quarter down year-over-year, can you give us some context or color, is there any particular region or factor that led to that decline?","George Kilguss","Sure Sterling. This is George. Regarding renewal rates, our Q3 preliminary renewal rate is expected to be down about 1.2% or 73.6% year-over-year. When you consider the two major components of our renewal rates, our previous renewed rate has held consistent in the mid 80% range, both year-over-year and sequentially. However, we've seen a slight decrease in our first time renewal rate in the quarter.","And while there's a variety of factors that can influence that, it for us has really been a geographic mix in the quarter. As we previously mentioned, China registrars first time renewal rate, as well as what we call the emerging markets had historically lower first time renewal rates. Then let's say more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe and as China has continued to grow for us in 2018 and again in 2019 it is really this change in geographic mix which is causing a little bit of downward pressure on the first time renewal rate.","Sterling Auty","So that makes sense, so maybe a followup is, the 9.9 million new names processed in the quarter, can you give us maybe a little bit more granularity as to what the geographic makeup of that looks like and how that has trended over the last year?","James Bidzos","Well, you point to the 9 .9 million gross adds and that's a good stack for us, I mean gross adds were up 3.5% year-over-year in the third quarter which actually was a record gross add third quarter for us, so continued good demand for the product in the third quarter here. As far as the regions of gross adds, they tend to change quarter-to-quarter depending on where registrars are fulfilling demand, but again China has done well for us in the third quarter. Third quarter we saw EMEA do pretty well for us and Asia-Pacific was doing pretty well for us as well in the third quarter.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Moving over to the negotiation with ICANN, I think there is a number of investors that just felt like, whoa why isn\u2019t this just a slam-dunk quick put in item 35 and you're done? You know, I think from some of the comments that you've made in the earnings calls, it does seem to be more of a negotiation and negotiation usually means both sides want something. There has been some question that I get from investors as to whether the ICANN fee would go up or what other elements we might actually see? Is there any just high-level color that you can give even prior to seeing the public comment documents?","James Bidzos","So your question is specifically about when in terms of the publication for public comment? I'm not sure, you kind of lost me right at the end there.","Sterling Auty","Nope, so the\u2026","James Bidzos","I guess that's exactly what the question is.","Sterling Auty","Yep, to be very specific, the question is, plans of negotiation should we expect that not only would we see changes to pricing coming into the Registry Agreement from the item 35 will there be other changes to the Registry Agreement since it is a negotiation?","James Bidzos","Well there is -- so I think, no I said that we can't provide any details, but I can reiterate and tell you that is an obligation to move the changes from the Cooperative Agreement which is the pricing, and we are satisfied with that process, and that is the amendment 35 pricing. There is also an obligation resulting from the 2016 extension to provide the security and stability. So I can tell you that in that process we're satisfied as well with that process, with the discussions that we have had, including security and stability. And in that process any obligations or expenses that arise from it, that's also an area where we're satisfied with the progress and also the amendment 35 pricing obviously. So hopefully that answers your question.","Sterling Auty","Yes, that makes sense. Thank you, Jim. And then last question, George just back you know as we think about the new guidance for the 3.2% to 3.7% growth in the domain overall, should we think that this would be a continuation of the trend in the renewal rate that gets us to that level for the full-year or is there any other factors that kind of weigh on it?","George Kilguss","Oh I mean, Sterling as normal there is seasonality we have in the fourth quarter i.e. there are quite a few holidays in the fourth quarter in the U.S. and abroad, and so it's obviously a combination of adds and renewal rates, but our guidance fully reflects our expectations for the full-year performance.","Sterling Auty","Thank you, guys.","Operator","We will take our last question from Nick Jones with Citi.","Nicolas Jones","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I guess thinking a little bit longer term, is there any discernible differences in kind of the number of people who are parking domains today than maybe were during the last recession and is there kind of any difference in the business today or are the profiles registrant set that you could add some color around that are different today?","James Bidzos","I think that's a very tough question to get into any specifics on, but generally I can tell you that this business has shifted steadily over the years. I mean you probably remember a few years ago when Google was making changes to its search algorithm that affected the way that people monetized domains, that affected registrar buying habits. Geography can play a role as well.","People buy domains for different purposes and different geographies. So it's -- there are many purposes obviously from branding yourself and building businesses. People buy domains for defensive registration purposes. There are lots of different reasons they buy them, they vary over time, other external factors that influence them, geographies, so it's kind of hard to generalize.","I can't think of any standout change or shift that I can point to that indicates any specific change or aspect of our business. As George said, this was a record Q3 with 9.9 million gross adds and so demand is good for the product, whatever the mix maybe, that's a subject for publication of some date in the future we might look at that. That's a good question, but it's really hard to sort of give you a detailed sort of granular answer to that. There is just so much activity and so many different reasons that people buy domains, and so many different types of monetization as well.","George Kilguss","Yes, and as a reminder Nick, we are thick registry, so we really, excuse me, a thin registry, so we don't see the registrars that provide that.","James Bidzos","We don\u2019t see the registrars that provide that, so we don\u2019t have quite as much information, but we certainly study these trends. And as I said there are diverse set of reasons that people buy domains.","Nicolas Jones","I got to appreciate it. One more, but it's kind of been the upcoming political cycle and the growing scrutiny on kind of big tack, is there any kind of increased regulatory risk that VeriSign you guys trying to implement amendment 35 as we get into 2020 or how should we think about that?","James Bidzos","We've read what you read about that, that's all we know. I haven\u2019t read anything lately. We've read what you've read.","Nicolas Jones","Okay, well I appreciate taking my questions.","James Bidzos","Sure.","Operator","That will conclude today's question-and-answer session.

There, you will also find our first quarter 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted.","Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited. And our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

And afterward, we will open up the call for your questions.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid start to 2016 for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders.","We reported revenue of $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $143 million in free cash flow. We processed nearly 10 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 2.65 million net new names ending with 142.5 million .com and .net domain names in a domain name base.","Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the first quarter we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million.","We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents. We continue to make progress and we'll provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress towards these objectives.","I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.5 million, consisting of 126.6 million names for .com and 15.9 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year.","In the fourth quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.3% compared with 72.5% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2016 will be approximately 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 73.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2015.","As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.","During the first quarter, we continued to see strength in net additions in many parts of the world, both from developed and emerging markets. Also during the quarter, we again saw activity coming from registrars in China that exceeded our expectations. At this point, we expect activity from registrars in China to normalize as we continue through the second quarter.","Also as discussed last quarter, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a large percentage of first time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated last quarter, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016.","Based on these and other factors, we expect the second quarter of 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names, and we are now forecasting the full-year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2.5%. As an update related to the launch of our IDN versions of .com and .net, the localized Katakana version of .com in Japanese launched in December and will be in general availability starting June 13. Also, we plan to launch the .com and .net Korean IDNs in May.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totals $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers.","GAAP operating income for the first quarter totaled $167 million, up 15.6% from $144 million in the first quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59.2% compared to 55.8% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $107 million compared to $88 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.82 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.66 for the first quarter last year.","As of March 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $667 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at the quarter end.","I'll now review some additional first quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $103 million as compared to the $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and compared with $104 million in the same quarter a year ago.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 63.3% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $112 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.79 last quarter based on 133.8 million and 133.4 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively.","We had a weighted average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares in the first quarter compared to 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.1 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 15.8 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.4 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2015 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.","Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the first quarter were $144 million and $143 million, respectively, compared with $133 million and $126 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year.","With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is an increase from the $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion revenue range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our updated expectation of full-year 2016 domain name base growth, which is now in the range of the 1% to 2.5%.","Full-year 2016, non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million, lowered from the $114 million to $120 million range as given on our last earnings call.","Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, lowered from the $40 million to $50 million range as given on our last earnings call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million. Due to domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in the 2016 are international. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman","Thank you, George. In closing, during the first quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We believe that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in a most efficient manner.","We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. So, I guess I'd like to ask, in terms of the revenue growth rate, revenue grew 9.1% year-over-year, but the name file grew 7.1%. Historically, if you look at those two, they've been very close to one another within 10 basis points, and here you have 200 basis points different. Do you have any insight into why the revenue growth rate might have been 200 basis points stronger than the name growth rate?","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Steve. I think a couple of factors. One, as we mentioned last quarter, we did have a .net price increase that took effect in February of this year. Also really the timing of when the ads came in, we clearly had a very strong 4Q of name additions, and we also had a very strong 1Q name additions. And so, as that revenue waterfalls, that also helped. While not material, our BFS business continue to grow in the quarter as well.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And then, you mentioned China, the expectation is that, that should normalize here in the second quarter. What gives you confidence or what leads you to believe that that's going to be the situation?","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think the short answer is, as we look at the trends, we've seen the demand that happened in the second half of the first quarter kind of ebb and flow. So we saw it come. It was pretty strong for a few weeks and then it came back to more than normalized path. So we don't have a perfect crystal ball, but based on the trends that we've seen that we've been tracking, it seems to be back on the normalized path for that particular region, at least as what we've seen historically.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is (14:37) for Sterling. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the Japanese IDN, which I believe is in the (14:44) space. (14:45) at this point, are you able to disclose the pricing for the registry fees and also what will be the subsequent IDN fee \u2013 what will the subsequent IDN fee priced similarly? Thanks.","D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman","I'm sorry but that was completely unreadable on our end. I don't know if you are on a cell phone, but none of us in this room could get a word of it, I apologize.","Unknown Speaker","Hello. Can you \u2013 is this better?","D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman","Oh, that's much better.","Unknown Speaker","Sorry. I'm sorry about that. Yeah. Just quickly, I wanted to ask about the Japanese IDN. Are you able to disclose the pricing for the registry fee at this point? And will the subsequent IDNs be priced similarly?","Todd B. Strubbe - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, so in Japan \u2013 hi, this is Todd Strubbe. In Japan, we are currently in our limited release one phase and we enter a GA in June. Our pricing right now has a combination of base pricing and we have lunched premium pricing, so it's a combination. Our general availability pricing is established at $8 for the registrars and then has several tiers associated with premium pricing.","Our Korea launch, we just announced, will go into Sunrise phase in May, as Jim said, with the targeted general availability for both Korea streams, the .com and the .net, in late August. And that pricing will likely be very similar to what we have priced in Japan.","Unknown Speaker","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll hear next from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Out of the 2.65 million net names that were added in the quarter, about how much of that came from Asia-Pac?","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So, we don't break out the gross adds by particular region, but what I can tell you is the incremental names that happened in the quarter that were \u2013 kind of surprised us was about a million names. So about a million incremental names in the quarter were over and above the trend line that we typically see in China.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And I guess, George, just getting back to your commentary on the ebbs and flows with respect to the second half of Q1 in China. If we sort of think back to Q4, if I recall, you had an extremely strong first six weeks in that quarter and then the activity seemed to die down quite a bit as well. Is the thought on normalization in Q2 a function of seasonality being stronger in Q1 versus Q4? I guess just any commentary there would be helpful.","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Clearly, seasonality has some to do with it. Q2 tends to be a little bit less than Q1. Q1 does tend to be our strongest quarter. But when we look at the trends from that particular market, it just deviated from the normal trend that we were expecting. And then again, subsequent to the end of the quarter, it came pretty much back on our expectations. The only other color I can give you is that, in fourth quarter when we saw the demand coming out of China, that was pretty broad spread across many TLDs and across frankly many of our own TLDs, whereas the one that happened in Q1 was fairly localized to .com. I don't have intelligence for all the other TLDs per se, but I can tell you, it was much more centered at .com than the Q4 event.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just one last question. I guess either for Jim and George. So just in light of the net adds activity in Q1, and then if I take the midpoint of your Q2, new name guidance, based on my math, it looks like the high end of your new 2016 guidance for unit growth, which would be 2.5%, it looks like that would actually imply if I'm not mistaken, net deletions not only for the Q4 as you outlined in your script, but in fact for the entire second half. And just wondering if you could help me understand, I guess, why the unit growth guidance for the full year would not be higher than 1% to 2.5% or is it just a function of conservatism?","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, just again in Q4 since the number of incremental names was so strong, we had about 3.5 million incremental names out of a total of 12.2 million. We hadn't seen that level of activity from the investment community over there. And so, it's a little bit of a unicorn. We're not exactly sure what the renewal rates are there. And so, we're just being, I think, prudent as to estimating what renewal rates can be, because we don't quite have an experience with that particular segment of that base and how they'll perform.","D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman","I think you need just think of it as a conservative approach to forecasting in a situation where we have a situation arising in Q4 that we just simply haven't seen before. We have a lot of data, and we have a lot of forecasting tools, but I think you should view that forecast in that light.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Could you help us understand as you look out at maybe 1Q 2017? I know you're not providing 2017 guidance in total. But do you expect kind of the same dynamic in that period to persist from what you're seeing in 4Q given the overage in registrations coming out of Asia in the current or in the most recent reported quarter?","D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman","I think it's just too early to speculate as to what will happen in Q1, but certainly what happened in Q1 of 2016 is very different than what happened in Q4 of 2015. So, the impact that we're anticipating in Q4 of 2016 really wouldn't be the same in the subsequent quarter. And I think it's sort of a favorable development that there's more of a concentration of .com registrations in the sort of increase in activity in Q1 of 2016","So, it's early to say, but I think there's just a larger number of renewing names, that ratio that exists in Q4 of 2016 is not very likely to be the same in subsequent quarters, it almost certainly won't.","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","And the only other thing I'll say is that \u2013 when we start seeing these names start to renew late in Q3 and Q4, we'll get some additional information that will help us to answer that question for Q1 and when we provide guidance on our fourth quarter call.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then, just as, Jim, as it relates to the contract processes, you said you're in the final stages there. I assume the next stage here would be a posting of that contract and \u2013 posting the agreements in the public comment period. And could you just let us know what your expected dates are to have that process wrapped up?","D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman","Yeah. I can't speak for all the parties involved. So, I can't give you a date. I can just tell you that we've moved down the road in drafting the agreement and we're much further along in that process and we certainly are making progress and I'm sure that, we'll certainly know more by the next time we talk to you in the following quarter, and it's very possible that something could happen before that.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just last question for George, on the guide for the year, you did raise your revenue guidance on the back of the strengthened demands. You didn't change your margin guidance, is there a corresponding increase in spending that you're pushing through or what else would explain the difference between higher revenue and margins not going up?","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Looking in our business with the recurring revenue model, we're clearly looking to continue to drive growth that we see various opportunities in various markets and we're trying to be flexible in making investments and marking to drive additional growth. And so we're always putting plans in place for future periods.","We do have some variable costs, as it relates to the fees that are charged for domain names that we pay to ICANN as these fees right up, so we do have some variable costs there. And if you look at some of our costs quarter-over-quarter, we have been investing in the business, but, yeah, I think, what you should imply is that as revenue grows, we're looking to invest in the business and maintain margins in the range we guided to.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple. So how should we think about the pace of internationalized.com and .net trans order agents (24:27) coming on or going GA over the rest of the year? And do you have any indications of early demand?","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","I think, Gray, and I think it's just too early. The limited release phase that we're in right now, those who are able to buy the .komo (24:53), the Japanese name, are limited to those who have the .com and they have to do that sort of the registrar, they have the .com, so the combination of those two has limited the addressable market in that limited release phase. So we'll really start to see once we hit general availability in the June timeframe and the 30, 60, 90 days after that. Same thing with Korea. Korea will be different in that we have both a .com and a .net there, so that will be the first time we'll test both of those strings in that market. And our follow-on plans past Korea, we're working on them and as we learn from Japan and Korea, both will help determine what we do next.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can any of those strings hit in the second half of the year or is it just too early to say?","George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","I think we're \u2013 we would be targeting probably two more strings by the second half of the year, maybe a third. So, we \u2013 that would be the high level plans, I'd say, but still not ready to share those yet.","Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments.","David Atchley, CFA - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations","Thank you, operator.

First, last week VeriSign issued an 8-K detailing the completion of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement, or RZMA, and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. The RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN is now effective and VeriSign has been discharged from those responsibilities under the Cooperative Agreement.","Additionally, NTIA approved the .com extension, which extends the .com Registry Agreement between VeriSign and ICANN until November 30, 2024 to coincide with the term of the RZMA. VeriSign agreed to cooperate with NTIA as it determines whether to exercise their right to extend the term of the Cooperative Agreement before it expires on November 30, 2018.","Second, as we stated earlier this year, a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 was to evaluate for acquisition top-level domains that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded. Consistent with this strategy, as announced in August, VeriSign entered into an agreement for the future assignment of the .web TLD. While there are still steps that need to occur before we become the registry operator for .web, we are excited about the .web opportunity as we believe that we are well-positioned to make it successful.","I will comment now on third quarter operating highlights. We reported revenue of $288 million, up 8.2% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $165 million in free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with 144.1 million .com and .net domain name registrations in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter.","As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter we continued our share repurchase program 2.2 million shares for $177 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of September the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.1 million consisting of 128.4 million .com registrations and 15.8 million .net registrations.","This represents an increase of 6.6% year-over-year and a net increase of 0.9 million domain name registrations from the end of the second quarter. During the quarter we processed 8.3 million new registrations. In the second quarter of 2016 the renewal rate was 73.8% compared with 72.7% for the same quarter of 2015.","While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2016 will be approximately 72.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2015. There are many factors that drive domain growth. These include but are not limited to Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.","During the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations, primarily from our registrars in China. The volume of these new registrations has been inconsistent and periodic compared to prior periods and by the end of the first quarter of 2016 reverted back to a more normalized registration pace.","Also, as discussed the last three quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the value of domain name registrations up for renewal - the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015.","While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these registrations will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base we still expect fourth-quarter deletions to be elevated with many of these deletions occurring towards the end of the fourth quarter. Based on these and other factors, we expect the full-year 2016 domain name base growth range of between 1% and 2% despite a net decrease to the domain name base of between 1.5 million and 2.8 million registrations in the fourth quarter.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to George.","George Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $288 million up 8.2% year-over-year. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S., and 42% was from international customers.","GAAP operating income in the third quarter totaled $175 million, up 13.2% from $154 million in the third quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 60.8%, compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $114 million, compared to $92 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 in the third quarter this year, compared to $0.70 for the third quarter last year.","As of September 30, 2016, the Company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion, and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $421 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad.","I\u2019ll now review some additional third quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full-year guidance.","Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million, as compared to $99 million in the second quarter of 2016, and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 65.3%, compared to 62.7% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 127.7 million shares. This compares to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2015, and $0.91 last quarter, based on 131.7 million and 130.6 million weighted average diluted shares respectively.","Dilution related to the convertible debenture was 20.8 million shares, based on the average share price during the third quarter, compared with 18 million for the same quarter in 2015, and 21.9 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter 2016 repurchase activity, and the weighted effect of the 2.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter.","Operating cash flow was $168 million and free cash flow was $165 million for the third quarter compared with $155 million and $157 million respectively for the third quarter last year. With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.135 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1.130 billion to $1.140 billion range given on our last earnings call.","Full-year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 63.5% and 64.5%, increased from the 62.5% to 64% range provided during the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million.","Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $30 million and $35 million, decreased from the $35 million and $45 million range given on our last call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million and $20 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international, primarily as a result of domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures.","In summary, the Company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2016.","Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","James Bidzos","Thank you, George. In closing, during the third quarter we continued to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long-term lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.","We believe the two developments I speak of, the .com extension and our move to becoming the registry operator for the .web extension will result in security and stability for our customers and our business as well as long-term growth opportunities for the Company.","We will now take your questions. Operator, we are ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. Want to start with - can you help us really understand the net impacts from both the .com extension and the signing of the Root Zone Maintainer? It feels like there was a number of moving parts, but maybe summarize the net impacts of both of those on the business.","James Bidzos","Sure, Sterling. Let me try to just, I guess, factually state what\u2019s actually changed. First of all, the IANA transition was completed and the IANA contract between NTIA and ICANN was allowed to sunset. So ICANN is now accountable to the community under enhanced accountability mechanisms.","Second, the term of VeriSign\u2019s .com Registry Agreement with ICANN is now extended to November 30, 2024. So, the next renewal cycle for .com will be in 2024 not in 2018. Third, the Root Zone Maintainer portion of the transition is now complete, as VeriSign will continue the Root Zone maintenance function it has historically performed, but now under a new contract called the RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN.","Fourth, there are two amendments to the Cooperative Agreement between VeriSign and NTIA. Amendment 33 discharges VeriSign from its Root Zone maintenance responsibilities and Amendment 34 approved the extension of the .com agreement to 2024 and gives NTIA the right to extend the Cooperative Agreement past its current expiration of 2018.","It also allows NTIA to conduct a public interest review for purposes of making the extension decision. And also VeriSign still has the right, I would point out, under Amendment 32, to seek removal of the pricing restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement if we demonstrate to the Department that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions. Those are the basic, factual changes in all of these various events of the last 30 days or so.","Sterling Auty","One follow-up to it on that last point. So, if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to expire, what does that mean for pricing? Do you automatically get the ability to raise prices? Will you seek a request from the DOJ? So what happens on the pricing front if the Cooperative Agreement does go away?","James Bidzos","So, if NTIA decides - and it\u2019s their process and their decision - but if they do decide to allow the Cooperative Agreement to sunset, as opposed to exercising their right to extend it - so, I don\u2019t want to speculate on that process because that\u2019s NTIA\u2019s decision whether to sunset it or extend it beyond 2018. I can tell you that we agreed to work with NTIA as they go through their process and make the decision.","However, I would point out one thing, which is that if there\u2019s a change to, or a termination of, or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, the .com Registry Agreement itself contains something called the Cooperation Clause that states that VeriSign and ICANN will negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the Registry Agreement, the .com Registry Agreement, as necessary for consistency with changes to, or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, if that helps.","Sterling Auty","It does, but kind of still leaves a little bit of ambiguity. So, if it goes away and you renegotiate with ICANN, I would imagine one of the things that, if I\u2019m in your shoes you would be interested in is negotiating back the ability to raise prices. Or would you still be under a consent decree of the Department of Justice through 2024 to keep .com prices capped?","James Bidzos","So, I think I can answer part of that. I\u2019m just trying to avoid speculating. But in your scenario, if you are assuming that the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset and there is no other contractual relationship or provision or restrictions - relationship between DOJ, DOC and VeriSign, then VeriSign would negotiate in good faith, as we are both required to under the agreement, with ICANN to effect whatever changes need to be effected as a result of the sunset of the Cooperative Agreement. So, that certainly would include pricing, but I don\u2019t want to speculate what that would look like today.","Sterling Auty","Okay. Last item. So just to clarify then, really the cap on pricing that the DOJ effectively helped put into place is not like when a DOJ steps in and declares a company a monopoly and puts in a consent decree where they have direct oversight and capping. You are saying that the price agreement that the DOJ market power study helped is really just entirely encapsulated within the Cooperative Agreement?","James Bidzos","I believe that\u2019s correct. It\u2019s a fact that the relationship that we have with NTIA is the mechanism by which the price caps are imposed on.com and that NTIA, where appropriate for its oversight through the Cooperative Agreement, consults with DOJ on issues of competitive issues, et cetera. So, if that went away there would be at that point - if that\u2019s all that happened and the Cooperative Agreement sunset and there is no other contractual relationship that we have at this point. We don\u2019t have that type of relationship that you described upfront in your question.","Sterling Auty","Makes sense. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steve Ashley","Great. Well, I\u2019m going to just pick up right where Sterling left off and just keep drilling down. So, because it is something we are all very interested in, if the Cooperative Agreement sunsets, who will control pricing? And you talked Jim about you would negotiate with ICANN. Would ICANN have the authority to set pricing, veto pricing? What we are just trying to understand where authority for setting and enforcing pricing would reside if the Cooperative Agreement sunsets on November 18, 2018.","James Bidzos","I don\u2019t want to speculate on what that process in detail would look like and, therefore, it\u2019s hard to say where it would come out. But it would, according to the language that\u2019s in the documents today, it would be the result of a good-faith negotiation between VeriSign and ICANN.","Essentially, the DOC is not in the picture if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset. So, having said that, I would say that trying to determine what that will yield I think would be speculating. But I would observe that ICANN\u2019s policies at least are fairly consistent in how they\u2019ve applied pricing across TLD, certainly since the new gTLD program.","There are a number of legacy TLDs, of course like .com and .net and .org and others. But it\u2019s just difficult to speculate on a process that only gets invoked under a set of circumstances that are two years away. I think the main point is that the pricing imposed on .com at least since 2006 has come directly from DOC, so that mechanism goes away. But in terms of what happens and who has the authority, it\u2019s a good-faith negotiation between VeriSign and ICANN. That much is factual.","Steve Ashley","Great. And then I would just like to ask a question on deferred revenue. It declined sequentially from - not a lot, a little bit, for the second time consecutively. That hasn\u2019t been kind of the norm over the past years. Is there any comment around the small sequential decline in deferred revenue we are seeing?","George Kilguss","Nothing other than it typically does slow down as the year progresses. Typically, at least historically we used to have very large registrations in the first quarter, so we\u2019d get a bump in deferred revenue and it would decline sequentially over the years. More recently that bump in Q1 has gotten less and so some of the changes year-over-year have rolled through, but nothing material that I am aware of, Steve.","Steve Ashley","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One on - you\u2019ve been pretty clear on the Q4 trajectory given what happened last year. Can you talk about how you look at that into Q1?","George Kilguss","So, Walter this is George. We\u2019ll give you Q1 guidance on our fourth quarter call. But, again, the reason for the large range that we put in place this particular quarter is the fact that it was a fairly large amount of names that came up for renewal, or will come up for renewal in this quarter.","And the cohort, or the type of names that they are, they are related to a Chinese investment community, we really don\u2019t have a tremendous amount of data around that. And so we are really waiting to take a look at those names as they come up for renewal in the middle of November and early December we will get a better look at that, and once we have a better look at that it will give us a little more clarity into Q1.","But we have always said, the Q4 is a relatively unique event. There\u2019s over 4 million names that are really coming up for renewal as a result of the demand that happened last year. And so we are really waiting to take a look at that before we provide guidance to Q1.","Walter Pritchard","And then, George, just on the expenses, you had a very good I guess, the expenses very low, declining year-over-year by about 3% in the quarter. Can you talk about the sustainability, I guess, first the source of the expense decline year-over-year and then the sustainability of that trajectory as you look into Q4 and beyond?","George Kilguss","Yes. I would say, as you have commented on, I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of trying to keep expenses level. When you talk about year-over-year you are looking at the third quarter. And I think it\u2019s probably more appropriate to look at the nine months because things can move from quarter-to-quarter. And when I look at the nine months on a non-GAAP basis, expenses in total are down a little bit. You are correct there. But we are seeing some movement between the groups.","So, we\u2019ve seen an increase in our cost of goods sold. We\u2019ve got more labor going on there. Sales and marketing, we\u2019ve talked about that. It\u2019s been lower, but we do have an intention to put more money to work there and I would think that\u2019s really more of a timing function. R&D is down. We have reduced labor there. As we talked about last quarter, I believe we did close our Indian Development Corporation over there last year and so we are getting some benefits from a labor perspective through the P&L at the present time.","And then G&A is up a little bit. We do have some slightly higher labor and we\u2019ve incurred some higher legal costs this quarter. As far as your questions to the sustainability, we really try to manage the total expense of the Company, the entire $400 million number on an annual basis. And we try to allocate those dollars to where they are. Clearly, we try to gain efficiencies, but at the same time we are not starving the business. And as you know, our business is relatively dynamic.","As the cyber environment continues to evolve we absolutely want to make sure we put enough resources into maintaining the security and stability of the business. So, we will continue to be vigilant on that, but to date we\u2019ve done a good job of keeping them in the range where they\u2019ve been historically.","Walter Pritchard","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We are taking a follow-up question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. That\u2019s also our final question.","Sterling Auty","Yes, just a housekeeping follow-up question. Can you remind us what the total number of names that are up for renewal in the fourth quarter and if you are willing to give it for the first quarter, so March actually, are?","George Kilguss","Yes, a couple of data points. The names that were up for renewal this quarter was 28.7 million and the names that are up for Q4 are going to be 32 million names that are up for renewal.","Sterling Auty","All right. Great. And how about March 2017, or is it too early to give that?","George Kilguss","I would say it\u2019s too early for that at this point.","Sterling Auty","And actually - and maybe one other we didn\u2019t touch upon. So, early here in the quarter, so you\u2019ve got the guidance for the decline in the base, but there was a pop, actually, in the Zone file of like 350,000 names the one-week, including a pretty healthy pop in .net. Anything that you can ascribe the jump to?","George Kilguss","Yes, we ran some marketing activities in the quarter around .net and they were actually relatively successful. And so the team is evaluating programs to see if we want to run some more of those. But we had a marketing program basically, and those numbers are roughly right, about 300 names came in from those marketing programs.","Sterling Auty","And when you talk about those marketing programs, are these different than - I think about in the past that you ran marketing programs with registrars at the end market to spur demand, but are these those types of things, or are these incentives where maybe you are giving discount on registry fees on .net above certain thresholds, or anything like that?","George Kilguss","The programs vary from program to program. This was more of a program we were looking to see if we were in a short-term program what would be the effect of. Sometimes we run programs throughout the year, much longer-term programs and we are questioning the effectiveness of those compared to some shorter-rate programs, shorter-term programs, and this one was a relatively short program. We just want to understand the duration of programs and get some feedback as we think about 2017.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you much.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David Atchley for closing remarks.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.","Operator","Once again that does conclude today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation."],"22125":["VeriSign, Inc.

Good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 154.8 million, consisting of 141 million names for .com and 13.8 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.4%.","During the first quarter, we processed 9.8 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.82 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2019 will be approximately 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.3% achieved in the first quarter of 2018. For 2019 full-year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.5% and 4.25%. Last quarter, we said that we began the process with ICANN to incorporate features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement including the pricing terms into the .com Registry Agreement. There are no updates to share at this time, but we continue to be engaged in this process that may take some number of months to complete.","Just to remind those not familiar with this process under the 2016 amendment that extended the term of the .com Registry Agreement, we also agreed to negotiate in good faith the flow-through changes made in the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and to preserve and enhance the security and stability of .com or the Internet. We are negotiating these items now, and we'll update you as appropriate.","During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.0 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.25 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George Kilguss","Thanks Jim, and good afternoon everyone. First quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 2.4% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $106 million, compared to $114 million last quarter and $113 million in the first quarter a year ago. Within the quarter were lower sequentially, primarily due to the elimination of approximately $3 million of costs associated with our Security Services sale last quarter, and the seasonal timing of marketing program spend. Operating income totaled $200 million, compared with $185 million in the first quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.4%, compared to 62% in the same quarter a year ago.","Net income totaled $163 million, compared to $134 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.35 in the quarter this year compared to $1.09 for the same quarter last year.","As of March 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.25 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $685 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. During the quarter, we repatriated $249 million from our international entities net of withholding taxes.","I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance.","As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $94 million, compared to $102 million last quarter and $101 million in the first quarter a year ago. Operating margin for the first quarter was 69.4% compared to 66.7% last quarter and 66.3% in the same quarter of 2018.","Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $158 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 120.3 million shares. This compares to $1.58 last quarter and $1.07 in the first quarter of 2018. Last quarter's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included a $0.36 benefit due to the gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.","Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $187 million and free cash flow was $178 million compared to -- with $90 million and $82 million respectively for the first quarter last year. Last year's first quarter 2018 cash flow included higher cash taxes related to international withholding taxes associated with last year's repatriation activities as well as higher cash interest related to our convertible debentures before they were retired.","Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.235 billion now from the $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 2.5% and 4.25% being partially offset by the loss of revenue associated with the sale of our Security Services customer contracts.","Our non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5%, and we'll continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for the security service customers. Our interest expense and non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement.","Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million to $55 million and cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $105 million lowered from the $95 million to $115 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2019.","Now I would like to turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","Jim Bidzos","Thanks George. The first quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and year-over-year revenue growth. And we generated an efficiently returned value to shareholders.","We continue to work, our work to protect grow. And manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders.","We'll now take your questions. And operator we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Q \u2013 Sterling Auty","Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. I wondered if we could start with -- I didn't hear an update on .web, anything that you can share with us there?","A \u2013 Jim Bidzos","There are no updates from .web at this point. The process continues","Q \u2013 Sterling Auty","Okay. And then, you mentioned that there is no update yet in terms of the Registry Agreement. Is there a formal process that you're going through? Or is just the discussion and negotiation? And can you at least say whether or not there\u2019s active discussions' going on?","A \u2013 Jim Bidzos","Well, we are engaged in the process. The process as we described it is under the 2016 amendment that extended the term of the com agreement.","We've agreed to negotiate in good faith the flow-through changes that come from the Cooperative Agreement that includes, the pricing terms and also to preserve and enhance the security and stability of .com and the Internet.","We're renegotiating those items now. Updates when appropriate, but I don't want to get into any particulars of the negotiation of course.","Q \u2013 Sterling Auty","Yeah. No, no. I just didn't know if there was particularly, publicly available information in terms of, if there is milestones that we should be looking for other than just a full update here as to the new agreement. I just wanted to make sure that we're covering our bases.","Jim Bidzos","Yeah, I understand. We'll update you as appropriate.","Sterling Auty","Okay. Sounds good. Two more. Just one any commentary in terms of the geographic when in terms of the name base and the gross registrations. What did you see geographically domestic\/international? And specifically within international, any color that you can provide in terms of what you saw out of the various regions?","George Kilguss","Yes. Sterling, this is George. I would say consistent with the recent quarters we continue to see both the U.S. market and the Chinese registrars perform quite well and they've been a lot of the driver for the past couple of quarters and they continue to be good markets for us.","Sterling Auty","And within that Chinese portion obviously going back we have the speculative nature. Do you feel like the names being added today are healthier growth meaning that they're being driven by more fundamental reasons that will make them stickier names?","George Kilguss","I can just tell you in the data that I look at from a renewal rate perspective. I haven't seen any change in the normal renewal rates that we historically see from Chinese registrars. So obviously it was a 45-days lag, but I don't see any deviation at least year-to-date in those numbers.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then last question around the TSA post the sale of those contracts, how long is that TSA? And within other income, is there a little bit of color in terms of the magnitude of that TSA?","George Kilguss","Yeah, sure. It's a 12-month agreement. It expires in December of this year. Having said that the parties do have the ability to extend that should they desire to do so. We recognized about $4 million of income in the quarter. It's in our non -- our other income. And so it's about $1.3 million a month is the income associated with that contract.","Sterling Auty","All right. Perfect. Thank you.","Jim Bidzos","Yeah. Sterling, it's Jim. Just -- you asked me about .web and I said that there is no update. But I just feel I should remind everyone that one of the losing bidders in the .web auction Afilias one of our competitors, they filed an arbitration against ICANN as you probably know trying to continue to delay the process. We're not parties to that arbitration, yet but we are actively seeking to participate in it.","Sterling Auty","Great. Thank you.","Jim Bidzos","Sure.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nick Jones with Citi.","Nick Jones","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Is there any kind of broader trends in nTLDs or country code TLDs that you could call out that maybe is impacting .com demand internationally?","George Kilguss","I think that, look the TLD market is a competitive market both .com and .net receive compensation from ccTLDs primarily in international markets. But new gTLD and legacy TLDs also provide competition. But we'll continue to compete effectively with those TLDs. You can see the zone they grow about 4.4% this quarter. New registrations were up about 2.1% year-over-year. So we're still competing effectively in the markets that we're in, but it is a competitive market out there.","Nick Jones","Thanks. And one follow-up on I guess the .web arbitration. What \u2013 how long or what would the process look like for VeriSign to join that arbitration and kind of get involved?","Jim Bidzos","Well, I hate to make this sound like a stock line but it is. I mean, we don't comment on any detailed aspects of any pending litigation, but it's \u2013 right now it's an arbitration between Afilias and ICANN and we're seeking as you pointed out to participate. Beyond that, I just don't have any update to provide. But as soon as we do, we'll let you know.","Nick Jones","Okay. Thank you for taking the question.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Rob Oliver with Baird.","Rob Oliver","Great. Hey. Thanks guys for taking my question. Jim, sorry not to go back to .web but I think you guys had indicated on the last call that that process could take a few months. Is that something that might take longer in your experience now since it's been a few months now since Afilias had filed that arbitration? Or is there just kind of no way for us to know and there's a process? Just any color would be helpful there. Thanks.","Jim Bidzos","Well, I think it's the latter. I mean, having been involved in a number of arbitrations, you obviously can't predict at what rate the wheels of justice will turn. But well, they may turn they are turning. So as soon as we have updates we'll certainly share them.","Rob Oliver","Great. Thanks. And it's come up a bit lately with clients as well as on some of your calls about the idea of kind of vertically integrating on the registrar and registry side again. I just wanted to kind of see, if I can pump you guys for your thoughts on that here quickly.","Jim Bidzos","Yeah. Nothing specific to say at this point, it's just there's nothing to add to what we've already said.","Rob Oliver","Okay. That's it for me. Thank you guys very much.","Jim Bidzos","Thank you.","Operator","And I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for final comments.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you.

Unauthorized recording of this conference call is not permitted.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","D. James Bidzos","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter demonstrates a solid start to 2013 for VeriSign. We reported revenue of $236 million, which was 15% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $145 million in free cash flow. In Naming, we processed 8.8 million new gross registrations during the first quarter and added 1.99 million net new names, bringing the name base to a total of 123.1 million .com and .net names. Our balance sheet remains strong, with approximately $1.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework.","As you may have seen during April, we completed the issuance of a 10-year $750 million senior unsecured note with a 4.625% coupon. We're very pleased with the results of this issuance, which is part of our revised capital structure. In a few moments, George will discussed our capital structure in more detail.","During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 3 million shares for $132 million. As of March 31, 2013, we have approximately $844 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.","I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. In our Naming business, at the end of March, the total base of registered names in .com and .net was 123.1 million, with registered names in .com totaling 108.1 million names and in .net totaling 15 million names. This represents an increase of 5.5% year-over-year and a 1.6% quarter-over-quarter. In the first quarter, we added 1.99 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.8 million new gross registrations. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the renewal rate was 72.9%, and the renewal rate for the whole of 2012 was 73.1%. While renewal rates are not totally measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2013 will be approximately 73.3%. This rate compares to 73.9% achieved in the first quarter of 2012. The renewal rate is still below the level of the first quarter 1 year ago. We see the continuing effects of changes in search algorithms and macroeconomic headwinds we discussed during the last few quarterly earnings calls. We cannot be certain of how long the renewal rate will be impacted by these factors, but we are now experiencing the fourth quarter of these effects. In light of these factors, we expect the second quarter net names for .com and .net added to the base will be between 0.9 million and 1.3 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to George.","George E. Kilguss","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing the first quarter financials, I would like to talk about our capital structure in more detail. As stated on prior calls, we have been looking at our capital structure across both our leverage profile, as well as our international cash balance and how the international cash balance interrelates with our international tax structure.","With our recently announced new senior unsecured debt issue, the company now has 3 debt instruments as part of its capital structure. First, the company has a $200 million senior unsecured credit facility that matures in November 2016. During April, we repaid the $100 million outstanding borrowings under this facility. We view this credit facility as a secondary source of domestic liquidity. Second, with our new debt issuance during April complete, the company now has a $750 million 10-year secured -- senior unsecured note with a coupon rate of 4.625%. This issuance produced approximately $738 million of net proceeds, of which $100 million was used to repay our revolving credit facility previously mentioned. We intend to use the remaining amount for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program. Third, the company has a $1.25 billion subordinated convertible debenture with a coupon rate of 3.25% that matures in 2037. The company now has total outstanding debt obligations of $2 billion, which reflects the full $1.25 billion face value of our subordinated debenture, the new $750 million debt issuance and the repayment of amounts outstanding under the credit facility, which occurred after quarter end.","With trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA of $595 million as of March 31, 2013, our pro forma total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 3.4x. This leverage ratio is consistent with the 1.5 to 3.5x range we discussed during prior calls and at a level we believe is reasonable for the company at this time.","Now as it relates to our international cash balance, the tax work to evaluate our international cash and international tax structure is progressing but remains ongoing. Of the $1.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, approximately $240 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally. The approximate $1.3 billion in international cash has not been taxed at the U.S. level, and our assertion remains unchanged from prior quarters that this balance is indefinitely reinvested offshore. As mentioned, our tax work is ongoing and we will provide updates as soon as appropriate. We expect this work to be completed by the end of the year, if not sooner, and we'll provide appropriate available updates on our Q2 and Q3 quarterly calls.","I will now discuss the first quarter financial results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $236 million, up 15% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $133 million, up 35% from $99 million in the first quarter of 2012. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.4% compared to 48.1% in the same quarter 1 year ago. GAAP net income totaled $85 million compared to $68 million 1 year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.52 in the first quarter compared to $0.42 for the first quarter in 2012. As of March 31, 2013, the company maintained total assets of approximately $2.1 billion, which includes the cash balances just discussed. Liabilities also totaled $2.1 billion at quarter's end.","During the first quarter, the stock price again exceeded the convertible debenture conversion trigger of $44.68, which means that the holders of the convertible debentures have the option of converting the debenture into common stock during the second quarter. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, the debt component of the convertible debentures, as well as the related embedded derivative and deferred tax liability, were reclassified from long-term liabilities to current liabilities, while the associated unamortized debt issuance costs were reclassified from long-term assets to current assets as of March 31, 2013.","I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2013 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $236 million for the first quarter. Approximately 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customers outside the U.S. Revenue in the first quarter from international sources grew 18% year-over-year, and domestic-sourced revenue grew 13% year-over-year.","Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $847 million, a $34 million increase from year-end 2012. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $8 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million compared with $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. As a reminder, fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $11.3 million lower due to certain fourth quarter benefits we discussed last quarter.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter expanded to 59.6% compared to 51.9% in the same quarter of 2012. It should be noted that during the first quarter of 2013, we delayed approximately $5 million of our marketing program expenses to later quarters, which contributed to a higher operating margin.","Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $94 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.58 compared to $0.42 in the first quarter of 2012 and $0.59 last quarter. As noted before, certain benefits described last quarter increased the fourth quarter earnings per share.","With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. In 2013, we now expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million as compared to the $40 million to $50 million range we gave last quarter as a result of the increased interest expense deduction created from our new senior note obligations. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 161 million shares in the first quarter compared to 162 million shares in the fourth quarter of last year. Dilution related to the convertible debenture was approximately 7.9 million shares based on the average share price during the quarter compared with 2.5 million for the same quarter in 2012. The share count was decreased by the full impact of fourth quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 3 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.","Operating cash flow was $151 million for the first quarter compared to $171 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $110 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was $145 million.","With respect to 2013 guidance, our guidance remains primarily unchanged except to update -- except for an update to our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income guidance. Revenue for 2013 is still expected to be in the range of $945 million to $960 million, representing an annual growth rate of 8% to 10%. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2013 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be at least 57%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $60 million and $62 million for 2013. This range is an increase from the $40 million to $42 million range given on our last call, primarily reflecting the increased interest expense from our new debt issuance. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $60 million and $80 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.","In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q1 2012. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks.","D. James Bidzos","Thank you, George. Before opening the call to your questions, I would like to remind you of our strategic framework and its 3 areas of focus. These are, first, to protect; second, to grow, which includes our innovation efforts; and third, to manage the business. During the first quarter, we continued our efforts in each of these areas. We believe that our discipline to deliver in these 3 areas, with the right balance, should continue to offer the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders.","We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just to start off, it's actually fairly unusual to see a 3% sequential revenue increase in a Q1, particularly given that net adds came in at the very low end of guidance. What drove the revenue outperformance in the quarter? Was it NIA or some other factor?","George E. Kilguss","Yes, Gregg, this is George Kilguss. Thanks for the question. In December of this year -- or in the fourth quarter, I should say, we actually changed our methodology of how we account for contra revenue. So contra revenue is a -- our marketing expenses we spend that are a deduct from revenue. We went to a GAAP convention, which recognizes that expense over the life of the customer contract that is entered into. So we had lower contra revenue in Q1. Going forward, the effects that we used to see from more of a seasonal factor in a Q1 from contra will not be as apparent, it will be more smooth as we're recognizing that expense over the contract life of the customer.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And George, can you walk through why you opted to delay about $5 million in marketing expenses in the first quarter? And also, do you expect to make most of that up in the second quarter or in future quarters?","George E. Kilguss","So, again, the marketing team constantly evaluates programs in its effectiveness, and programs that we have in the pipeline based on market activities going on. The team, during the quarter, made a determination that it wanted to delay some programs. It didn't think that its effectiveness was going to reach its maximum potential and chose to delay that for a few quarters. Right now, we're expecting to see that. Still, in the third and fourth quarter of this year, the team is regrouping on some of those programs. And we'll get more of an update on that on our next quarter call, but right now, we're expecting to continue to spend that in this fiscal year.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fantastic. And then for Jim, last quarter, I think you made the comment that you were seeing early signs of a stabilization and improvement in renewal rates. And as you pointed out on -- in your prepared remarks, on a year-over-year basis, you're obviously still working through some of the algo changes. But this represented some fairly nice improvement versus the prior period. I'm just kind of wondering how you're sort of thinking and looking at renewal rates at this point going forward.","D. James Bidzos","Well, we're being -- looking -- I would say we're cautiously optimistic about what's happening, but we don't guide to renewal rates, of course. And first of all, I would say that we're still -- we're in the fourth quarter of the algorithm -- search algorithm changes. And so we're still uncertain exactly how that's going to play out. Those changes are ongoing and continuing. So I think we're not in a position to say that those changes have been absorbed or that they've ended, they continue. And secondly, as I mentioned, we still are feeling the effects of macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in Europe.","George E. Kilguss","Yes. And Gregg, let me -- this is George. Let me give you a little bit more color on that. As we've previously discussed, our zone metrics have been impacted by both the poor economic conditions here and abroad, as well as changes to algorithms -- search algorithms. As it relates to Google, while they don't provide that much information as it relates to past or future changes to their algorithm, what we do know is, and as we previously discussed, they made 2 major algorithm changes called Panda and Penguin. But when you look at Panda -- Panda started in 2011, and since its inception, they started -- they made over 25 different updates to that particular algorithm change. Of the 25 updates, 14 of those updates happened in 2012. So 56% happened in 2012, and they've actually had 2 additional updates here in the first quarter. So those changes do continue to go on. As it relates to the Penguin change, as we discussed last year, the first time we saw a Penguin change came out was in the first quarter of 2012. And they had -- they made a total of 3 changes to their Penguin algorithm in 2012. Now we haven't seen any changes yet in 2013. I believe Matt Cutts from Google made some comments in a seminar that they believe they were going to make another change in 2013 to Penguin. But I guess my point here is that they may continue these changes to the algorithm. Some impact is more than others. We don't know the impact of the changes until after they make them. So we're constantly monitoring those. But they have made a significant amount of changes, especially in 2012, which have an effect in future periods for us. So we continue to monitor that. We take that information into the guidance that we provide you as 1 data input, but there are many changes that happened, at least, over the past year and the current quarter.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Fantastic. That's very helpful. And then if I could just ask one final question since it's relevant for all of our models. I'm just wondering if you're -- to get a sense of how you're thinking about putting the incremental $650 million of debt to use from a potential buyback standpoint.","George E. Kilguss","So Gregg, great question. We have historically not guided to buybacks in any particular quarter. I think if you look at the company's track record, it's had a very consistent track record in the first quarter. We did $132 million of repurchases. As Jim mentioned, we always look at our strategic framework. We look at the cash flow from what do we need to invest in the business to protect the assets? What level of liquidity do we need to maintain on hand? What cash do we need to invest to generate positive IRR returns to propagate growth and innovation? And then to the extent that each quarter we feel we have cash that we deem as excess, we then make decisions on what cash we believe we should be returning to shareholders. So we don't guide, we haven't guided to that, but I think if you look at our track record, we've been relatively consistent in our results and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate.","D. James Bidzos","I would just add -- this is Jim. I would just add as well that George talked in his remarks about our capital structure. Part of that obviously is debt leverage ratios. We have talked in the past often about the fact that the company did not have as much debt as it could have. Would it have as much as it absolutely could have? We said, \"No, the number will be somewhere in between.\" I think now you've seen that. And clearly, as you saw from the announcement earlier, when we closed on the debt offering, it was under very attractive terms for the company. We see that as a permanent part of our capital structure under attractive terms. And we've been very clear about the stated purpose for that general corporate purposes, potential acquisitions and potential share repurchases, among other things. And I think our position on acquisitions, mergers and acquisitions, has been very clear and consistent. There's no change whatsoever on that. And as George mentioned, we don't guide on buybacks. But I think if you look at them, how we've dealt with our use of cash issues, which we determine from quarter-to-quarter, certainly, you can look back and see that share repurchase has, under these market conditions over the last couple of years, been an attractive way for us to return value to shareholders.","Operator","And moving on, our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to follow on that last point, Jim. Is buybacks really the main focal point? Or how, within that strategic framework, would you characterize buybacks versus special dividend versus regular dividend as potential capital return?","D. James Bidzos","Well, we don't guide to any of those, obviously. And we do evaluate our cash situation, our cash needs and our deployment of our cash on a quarterly basis. I think looking back, extraordinary dividends during the divestiture period when we did have divestiture proceeds, certainly, were one way that we deployed cash. Share buyback has been a more consistent method for us. But, again, obviously, we don't guide. So at this point, I'd say based on very dynamic conditions, in the last few quarters, over the course of 2012 and over the first quarter of 2013, clearly, you've seen that share repurchase has been our preferred method of cash deployment. That's based on current conditions. There's no change in our strategy, as I mentioned, with respect to M&A or other uses of cash, it's just determined every quarter.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And George, could you quantify the impact on the first quarter from that change in accounting on contra revenue? And did you say that it's bigger in the first quarter as you adopted the plan and starts to fade? I missed what you were -- how we were explaining that.","George E. Kilguss","So contra is, I would say, for all intents and purposes, now going to be more consistent in each quarterly number. It was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter from fourth quarter to first quarter. First quarter 2012 had probably about $4 million more of contra depressing Q1 in 2012. But Q4 to Q1 were very consistent in the amounts.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And last question, on the repatriation analysis that you're doing, what's left to determine? You mentioned before, at the end of the year, you need a ruling by a tax authority. Or what else can we be looking from the outside to gauge where you're at in the process?","George E. Kilguss","So as you can imagine, we've been evaluating the strategic alternatives related to our international tax and related liquidity. As you can appreciate, that work is very complex. It is ongoing. We had hoped to have had an update for you know, but as mentioned, that work continues. There are a number of complexities we have, a number of dependencies as well. And we'll give you an update as soon as we can, but it's ongoing. At the end of the day, as you might expect, we need to understand the full cost and risk of any potential changes to our structure before we consider any decision to potential changes. And it is just a very complex area. We do have some dependencies that we're looking at. And we'll provide you an update clearly on Q2 and Q3, if not before. But we think that work should be completed by year-end.","Operator","And moving on, we'll now hear from Walter Pritchard of Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","George, I'm wondering just on the margins for the year. I'm wondering if you could -- I didn't hear you talk about the exit margin, again, on this side in the prepared remarks. But what are you thinking in terms of exit margin? I guess that's first question.","George E. Kilguss","I'm sorry. Was that marketing expense you're talking about -- you're asking about?","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, sorry. The exit -- the operating margin you expect to exit with in the fourth quarter?","George E. Kilguss","So -- thank you. I understand now, the operating margin exit rate. So, again, our guidance for the full year is that we expect it to be at least 57% non-GAAP operating margin. We don't guide to a fourth quarter exit rate. We were higher in the first quarter because we did delay some of these marketing expenses. We do expect to spend those this year. So we have not changed our guidance or updated our guidance of at least 57% for 2012.","D. James Bidzos","This is Jim. Just a little bit of additional color on some of the marketing expense. Some of that, a portion of it is tied to investment in marketing, some of the new TLDs that we've applied for. For example, the IDNs, which are actually first in the order of delegation in ICANN's program. And there have been -- there's been some small delay, some uncertainty in that program. Some of our marketing expense is tied to that. So not all of it is entirely within our control. But I think, yes, we expect to spend it during the year. So there's some variability there based on outside factors that are not entirely within our control.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then I guess just on a major path on the guidance for net adds for the second quarter, I guess, a little lower than we were expecting. But we've seen the second quarter sort of be all over the map, historically. And I'm wondering, as we get kind of a level below the headline net add guidance, are you guys thinking about a particular change in trajectory between renewal rates and growth adds in terms of how you're getting to the Q2 net add guidance?","George E. Kilguss","Walter, we continue to look at our models, factor in many things we just talked about. Some of the continuing changes that are happening with the Google algorithm, we take that into consideration. Our best visibility for Q2 is the guidance we laid out in the call, 0.9 million to 1.3 million. That's what we're seeing today. Again, we do provide that visibility, as you know, daily. It's updated on our website every 12 hours. So you guys are seeing it in real time. But that's what we're seeing at least for the quarter. We talked about last quarter that our total zone growth, our guidance was based on a 4% to 6% total zone growth. That's still consistent with our view there. So we're looking at the total zone, 4% to 6%, that has not changed. But that's what we're seeing for Q2 is this range of 0.9 million to 1.3 million.","D. James Bidzos","As George said, it incorporates all of our best forecasting tools, but there are 2 major components under which we have very little direct influence. One is certainly macroeconomic conditions and particularly in Europe. And additionally, search engine algorithmic changes, which, as George mentioned, were highly concentrated in 2012, do continue. We do expect another Penguin update in 2013. Google has signaled that clearly. But those are 2 major factors that are a component of our guidance. So those are 2 that we have no direct influence over, and they're all reflected. And that's in the 0.9 million to 1.3 million guidance number that we provided.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Harris Heyer","This is actually Harris Heyer on behalf of Phil Winslow. I was just hoping you could provide us a little bit of color on your IP licensing strategy going forward from here.","D. James Bidzos","I'm sorry. I missed the last part.","George E. Kilguss","IP licensing...","Harris Hayer","On your IP licensing strategy.","D. James Bidzos","I'm not sure we're in a position right now to give you more color. We're in a middle of a very active effort to inventory, assess and develop a strategy around our IP. I have mentioned in the past that our goal actually is not primarily to derive direct patent licensing royalty revenue from our IP but to use it in support of our business goals and our business planning. That certainly is unchanged, but that activity is well underway. And I hope we'll be able to tell you more shortly.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And that will come from Dan Cummins with B. Riley Bank.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","First, I am sorry, I missed -- you gave the renewal rate for the fourth quarter, and I missed it. And I wanted to ask if you could give us a rough idea of the number of names up for renewal in 2Q. That's the first part.","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Dan. The renewal rate in Q1 was -- again, it's not final until 45 days after the end of the quarter, but our estimate is 73.3% for Q1. And the number of names up for renewal in the second quarter is 26.1 million names.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Okay, great. And I want to just be clear on the marketing spend. Were you talking about $5 million per quarter? Or is that $5 million for the whole year? And -- those comments about the external factors, I think that explains quite a bit.","D. James Bidzos","That $5 million was a number based on calendar 2013, not quarterly, for the marketing spend.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Okay. So we should -- so in terms of understanding maybe the level of profitability that the business is running at right now, it -- the 59.6%, obviously, it seems a little bit overstated. But it probably isn't that far off, actually, if we're not going to see -- in other words, if the 5 just gets peanut buttered out over 3 quarters, the business seems to be running at a level, whatever, 100 to 200 basis points better than the full year guidance. Is that roughly correct?","George E. Kilguss","We will spend -- the $5 million that we did not spend in Q1 from marketing, the intention of our marketing department today is to continue to spend that this year. So they have -- it's not in place of other programs. It's programs that, as Jim talked about, some of it is tied to the new gTLD program. So some of that is not in our control, but our -- we expect our marketing spend to accelerate a little bit as we have these new programs going on and as this $5 million has shifted out of Q1 into later quarters.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Great. Okay. And one more thing I may have missed. Did you give headcount? And have you -- did you project headcount increase or decrease from where we are today out to year-end?","George E. Kilguss","Sure, Dan. So we -- I believe the headcount number was on our slide -- in our slide deck. Total headcount was 1,070 employees. We do not give a forecast for headcount. That headcount is slightly down from Q4 levels, which was about 1,096 for full-time employees. But 1,070 is the answer to your question.","Operator","And we'll take our last question today from Jaimin Soni of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jaimin Soni - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First, kind of going back over what Sterling had asked earlier, looking at the guidance for the second quarter in terms of net domain name adds and the first quarter trend, it seems like the second half of the year, we should expect some normalization or an uptick to get to the 4% to 6% growth for the full year. Is that -- just trying to understand what gives you some confidence that you will see some improvement in the growth rate in the second half. And secondly, just wanted to get an update on the gTLD process from your perspective. When do you think that will start contributing to revenues?","George E. Kilguss","Jaimin, this is George Kilguss. Thanks for your question. Again, the guidance that we provided and -- for the quarter and the expectation for the zone, that is based on the most recent information we have. When -- clearly, when you look at historic net adds, you see that Q1 does tend to be a little stronger and then it does tend to flatten out. There are also changes year-to-year when you look at when certain holidays fall. Especially internationally, you can see that there are some Chinese holidays that happen in the first quarter that take those -- that market -- take those folks out of the market for a little bit and they tend to come back in. The Chinese New Year this year was delayed or was later than the previous year by several weeks. And so there's a number of factors that go into the model. Again, Q2, the 0.9 million to 1.3 million, that's what we're seeing today. But we still, at least, we sit here today, believe the zone will grow between 4% and 6%. As it relates to new gTLDs, that program looks like it's still in the works here, but we don't expect too much revenue in 2013 as a result of that program.","D. James Bidzos","I just want to give you a little more color on the TLD program. I think the ICANN just had their meeting a couple of weeks ago in Beijing. And there are couple of areas where the program is moving a little bit slower. There was a target date to make some major steps of April 23, a couple of days ago. That date has been delayed. In Beijing, there was a couple of major events. Number one is that advice was received from the government advisory council for ICANN, and I think that there's some issues that have to be addressed by applicants, which is probably going to take some time. That's been put out to public comment. And also, the process of contracting with registrars and registries in a new gTLD program is also a process that now involves public comment period for those contracts. So that's going to take some additional time as that process plays out. There was also a session in Beijing on security and stability. And -- but certainly, I commend ICANN for their commitment to make sure that all critical security and stability issues are addressed prior to delegation going forward. So I think there's a bit more work to do there. This is -- ICANN is getting operational. This is a major undertaking, a massive overhaul of global Internet infrastructure. So there have been delays in the past. It's probably not going to go perfectly smooth. I think at this point, we still expect the program to get off the ground this year but probably later in the year rather than earlier. And I don't think that we expect any significant revenue from our applications and our participation in the program this year. But Pat's here, he was in Beijing. If there's anything, Pat, you'd like to add.","Patrick S. Kane","I think you got it covered.","D. James Bidzos","So I think George said it succinctly, there's -- I just wanted to give you a little bit more color, but there's no significant revenue that we anticipate in 2013. Although our applications, as you know, are IDNs, which should be early in the process. So as the program does get underway, once again, I think we're well-positioned to participate with our 14 applications, including our 12 IDNs. So we continue to work within the program, work with ICANN, monitor progress and look forward to the program launching at some point.","Operator","And Mr. Atchley, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David Atchley","Thank you, operator.
