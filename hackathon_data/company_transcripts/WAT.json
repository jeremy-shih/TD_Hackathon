All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference call. This conference call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Bryan Brokmeier, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bryan Brokmeier","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company for the first quarter and full year 2020.","We caution you that all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risks factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 28, 2020.","During today\u2019s call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and available on the company\u2019s website.","In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning\u2019s press release.","Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today\u2019s call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chris O'Connell, Waters\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning\u2019s call is Sherry Buck, Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, I'll provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 operating results, as well as some broader commentary on our business. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and summarize our first quarter and full year 2020 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.","Briefly reviewing our operating results for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 1% and adjusted earnings per share grew 11%. The fourth quarter played out generally as we expected, with mixed market conditions similar to those we experienced throughout 2019, but also with encouraging progress on key growth initiatives, particularly the positive impact of our new products.","In the quarter growth in large molecule pharma and biomedical research applications driven by our new product offerings was largely offset by market conditions in our industrial markets, China and continued capital spending softness in small molecule pharmaceutical applications.","Looking at the full year 2019 in total, revenue grew 1% and adjusted earnings per share grew 8%. Macro factors led to a more variable set of end market conditions than we had expected entering the year. Customers in key markets we serve were more cautious in their capital purchasing throughout 2019 and more willing to delay spending.","I'd like to review the three areas where we were most impacted by this dynamic. First, government policy changes in China affected the food and pharmaceutical markets. As a reminder, China represents 18% of our global revenue and continues to be a key growth priority for the company. Our business mix in China is unique within our global portfolio as well as within the industry with a higher concentration of our business coming from pharma and food testing.","In 2019 China revenues were flat year-over-year following double-digit growth in 9 of the prior 10 years. In 2020 our initial view on China coming into the year is to expect stable end market conditions relative to 2019 driven by cautious, but steady, pharma and industrial spending, moderate academic spending and stabilization in the food market.","That said, we are closely monitoring the Coronavirus outbreak and it's too early to understand what impact this rapidly evolving situation will have on our business. Therefore, no impact is included in our 2020 guidance. As always, the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our customers is our top priority and we are taking appropriate caution in terms of employee travel and activities.","Second, the global market for small molecule pharmaceutical LC applications, where Waters has unique focus and capability, has been in a slower growth environment. In 2019 our small molecule pharmaceutical business was down modestly in line with the overall market. Looking ahead to 2020 our assumptions assume stable market conditions relative to 2019.","Meanwhile we remain confident in the underlying secular growth drivers of the small molecule LC market, including steadily increasing prescription volumes as patient access to therapeutic medications rises around the world, as well as increasing quality and safety requirements in all markets. We continue to invest in advancing our LC instrument portfolio and are well-positioned to benefit when demands normalizes.","And third, Europe was flat in 2019 as industrial market headwinds offset academic and governmental strength. Looking ahead we're encouraged that clarity around Brexit could help stabilize the European macroenvironment. This stabilization contributed to our fourth quarter improvement and supports our confidence in modestly better conditions within the region in 2020.","Market dynamics aside, we remain sharply focused on our core growth strategy of organic innovation and are excited about the significant uptick in meaningful new product launches during 2019. We are pleased with our market development activities to date and particularly encouraged by the increasing contribution of new products in Q4.","Most notably, the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS and our two new tandem quad mass spectrometers, all contributed more meaningfully to our growth in the quarter and we expect that this new product contribution will continue to ramp in 2020.","We remain very excited about our technology roadmap and believe that we are not only at the front end of a major new product cycle, but also adorable improvement in R&D productivity and therefore a more sustainable new product cadence into the future.","Taking a closer look at the business starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category were flat for the quarter. Geographic strength in Europe and India was offset by a decline in sales into clinical applications as well as softness in our China pharmaceutical business which is partly attributable to the difficult comparable quarter a year ago.","The global large molecule market and our performance within it remained robust, supported by our focused investments in this category across LC, mass spectrometers and chemistries. Conversely, the global market for small molecule pharmaceutical applications remained softer than historical levels with flat revenue in the quarter. For the full year our pharmaceutical category sales were up 2%.","Sales to our worldwide industrial category which includes the material science, food and environmental markets were down 1% in the quarter with strength in food testing markets up during Q4 offset by weakness in materials characterization. For the full year our worldwide industrial category sales were down 2%.","Sales to our academic and governmental categories were up 10% in the fourth quarter, driven by the impact of our new technologies serving the pharmaceutical and biomedical research categories, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. For the full year our academic and governmental category sales were up 3%.","Next I will review our sales performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest region in terms of revenue, was flat in the fourth quarter. China declined 3% as pharmaceutical growth declined modestly in the quarter on a difficult comp, partially offset by stabilization in food markets.","Looking specifically at the China generic pharmaceutical market, the second round of the GPO process, previously referred to as the 4 plus 7 program [ph], played out as we expected, and the third round is now underway. Our customers are maintaining a pragmatic tone through this process and we continue to see those customers, notably local big pharma companies and some multinationals win tenders due to the program's increasingly stringent quality requirements and their benefits of scale.","We are also seeing strong demand for our chemistry offerings from this customer base, which we expect to continue as the GPO process supports rising generic prescription volume in China, bolstering our confidence that we will see increasing instrument demand over time.","In India, solid growth was driven by the continuing recovery in the pharmaceutical market, partially offset by food softness. For the full year, Asia grew 3%, driven by solid growth in India, Japan and Korea, while China was flat.","Turning to the U.S., revenue was flat in the fourth quarter as strength in large molecule pharma, food and biomedical research was offset by weakness in small molecule pharma, material science and clinical applications. Overall, the Americas declined 1% in the fourth quarter, driven in part by expected weakness in Latin America, due to the ongoing political instability in both Mexico and Brazil. For the full year the U.S. grew 1% while total Americas revenue was flat.","In Europe, sales grew 5% in the quarter, a result of solid year-end budget spending by certain large pharma customers and continued strength in academic and governmental, partially offset by a modest decline in industrial. We saw particular strength in demand for our new mass spectrometers instruments from both academic and pharmaceutical customers. For the full year, sales in Europe were flat.","Finally, I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instrument sales declined 1% in the quarter and 2% for the year. LC instruments declined moderately consistent with broader market LC trends that we spoke about earlier. Market dynamics aside, we are confident that we can leverage our strong LC installed base and expanding product portfolio to support improving growth when customer LC spending patterns recover.","In mass spectrometers, growth in Q4 was driven by our rich portfolio of new products, as well as solid demand in the global food business. Momentum continues to build for the BioAccord as market development activities progressed well across all geographies, producing a strong fourth quarter and furthering our complements in a multiyear revenue ramp. The new Cyclic IMS and SYNAPT XS made meaningful contributions to the fourth quarter and were a key reason for the strong academic and governmental growth.","Lastly, the addition of two new tandem quads strengthened our overall portfolio positioning us to benefit from any pickup we see in the global food and applied markets. To attest to the enthusiastic reception of our new products, we have already received one major award for the SYNAPT XS and two awards for the BioAccord, including SelectScience's Scientist's Choice Award for the best new drug discovery and development product for 2019, and Frost & Sullivan's 2019 Global New Product Innovation Award.","Waters branded recurring revenues, which reflect a combination of service and precision chemistries, grew 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year. Chemistry strength was driven by our pharmaceutical business. We saw solid growth across our chemistry portfolio, including HPLC columns, application kits, UPLC columns and bioseparations columns.","Turning to our TA product line, sales declined 8% in the fourth quarter with TA instrument system sales down 12% and service sales up 3%. The weakness was largely due to reduced spending levels by our largest polymer and chemicals customers, which was broad based across our instrument portfolio and geographies.","For the full year, our TA product line sales declined 3% with TA instrument system sales down 5% and service sales up 3%. Despite the challenging market conditions we faced in 2019, we have strong confidence in our TA instruments' team and product portfolio, and expect to return to growth in 2020.","To recap 2019, challenges in the global macroeconomic environment impacted our customers who were more cautious in their capital purchasing throughout the year than we expected. Returning to the big picture, we remain steadfastly focused on executing on our five-point value creation model. As we have consistently communicated, we aim to create shareholder value by, 1) holding a leading specialty position in structurally attractive markets; 2) executing a focused growth strategy driven by organic innovation; 3) seeking opportunities for continuous operational improvement in innovation, channel, and operations: 4) maintaining capital discipline; and 5) operating with a performance oriented culture and management team.","Our goal remains to deliver strong sustainable long-term growth. We are confident in the durability of the growth opportunity in our end markets, as well as our consistent corporate strategy that is highlighted by innovation. Accelerated R&D investments over the past several years, which along with a more disciplined approach to project selection and portfolio management, is resulting in meaningful improvements in R&D productivity.","Looking ahead to 2020, we expect to realize further benefit of our recently launched products. Furthermore, we seek to supplement our organic innovation and growth by more actively deploying capital to purposeful M&A. Over the past two years we have strengthened our internal capabilities and built a robust acquisition and minority investment pipeline.","Last month we announced the acquisition of Andrew Alliance broadening our technology portfolio to include advanced robotics and software that will positively impact our customers' workflows across pharmaceuticals, life sciences and material science markets.","With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a review of our Q4 and 2019 financials and our outlook for 2020. Sherry?","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter we recorded net sales of $716 million, an increase of approximately 1% in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 1% resulting in flat sales as reported. For the full year sales grew about 1% before currency translation, which decreased sales growth by approximately 2%, resulting in a full year sales declined of approximately 1% on a reported basis.","In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical category were flat, sales into our industrial category were down 1%, our academic and governmental category grew 10%. For the full year, the pharmaceutical market category grew 2%, our industrial market category declined 2%, and our academic and governmental category was up 3%.","Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue which represents a combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue grew 6% in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 3%. For the full year recurring revenue grew 5% while sales for instrument product groups declined 3%.","As we noted last quarter, recurring sales were impacted by one additional calendar day in the quarter, which resulted in a slight increase in service revenue sales. Looking ahead, there is one less calendar day in the first quarter and two additional calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019.","Breaking fourth quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services grew 2% while sales of TA branded products and services declined 8%. Combined LC and LC\/MS instrument platform sales were down 1% and instrument sales were down 12% for TA. Looking at our growth rates in the fourth quarter geographically, sales in Asia were flat with China declining 3%. Sales in Americas were down 1% with U.S. flat and European sales were up 5%. For the year Asia sales were up 3% with China sales flat. Sales in the Americas were flat with the U.S. up 1% and Europe sales were flat.","Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.2% as compared to 59.9% in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a full year basis gross margin was 58% compared to 59% in the prior year. The lower gross margin relative to the prior year in both the quarter and the year was driven by foreign exchange rates, lower fixed cost absorption and mix.","Moving down the fourth quarter P&L, operating expenses were 3% lower in the quarter and 1% lower for the year on a constant currency basis. This was a result of lower variable expenses and disciplined spending controls throughout the year. In the quarter our effective operating tax rate was about 11% versus 12% in the prior year quarter.","For the full year our effective operating tax rate was about 13%, which is flat against the prior year. The lower tax rate versus our expectation is a result of the mix of profits in our tax jurisdictions and discrete items in the quarter. Net interest expense was $10 million, an increase of about $9 million from the prior year as anticipated as we shifted to a net debt position over the course of the year.","Our average share count came in at 64.3 million shares, a share count reduction of approximately 15% or about 11 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased to $3.20 in comparison to $2.87 last year, an increase of 11%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.12 compared to $2.46 last year. For the full year our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 8% to $8.99 per share versus $8.29 last year.","Overall, the non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share growth for the quarter and the year was the result of lower expenses and our ongoing share repurchase program. On a GAAP basis full-year earnings per share were $8.69 versus $7.65 in 2018. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning.","Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our fourth quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2019 free cash flow came in at $158 after funding $54 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to investment in our new Taunton chemistry facility. In the fourth quarter this resulted in $0.22 of each dollar sales converted into free cash flow and $0.24 for the full year.","Now I'd like to provide an update on our fourth quarter activities related to capital deployment, which we categorized into three areas; investing for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return of capital to shareholders.","In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $560 million in the fourth quarter. These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow resulted in cash and short-term investments of $337 million and debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $1.3 billion and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.7 times at the end of the year.","Looking ahead, we remain committed to deploying capital in the context of our three priorities and will continue working towards a capital structure of approximately 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA. As a result, our full year guidance reflects about $800 million of share repurchases with approximately $200 million of shares during the first quarter. Over the course of the year we will evaluate our share repurchase program and provide updates as appropriate.","Turning to working capital, accounts receivable days, sales outstanding came in at 77 days this quarter, up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of last year. In the quarter inventories increased by $29 million in comparison to the prior year quarter, driven by planned inventory build related to both, Brexit contingency planning and to support the continued ramp of our new products.","As we look forward to the year ahead, I'd like to provide some broader context on our full year 2020 guidance. To summarize several points that Chris mentioned earlier, we expect increasing benefits from our recent new product introductions, TA instruments returning to growth, stable conditions in the LC pharma market, and stability in China, but note that potential impacts from the Coronavirus outbreak have not been factored into our guidance. These dynamics support full year 2020 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 1% to 3%.","At current rates, currency translation is assumed to be approximately neutral to 2020 sales growth. Gross margin guidance for the full year is expected to be in a range of 58% to 58.5%. Every year we look to balance growth, investment, and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2020 operating margins of approximately 30%, based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of variable expenses, and disciplined expense controls.","Moving below the operating income line, other key assumptions for full year guidance are, net interest expense of $50 million $52 million, full year effective tax rate of 14% to 15%, an average diluted share count of approximately 62.5 million shares outstanding, and lastly modest dilution from the acquisition of Andrew Alliance. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2020 earnings for fully diluted share are projected in a range of $9.15 to $9.40, which assumes a negative currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 1 percentage point.","Looking at the first quarter of 2020, we expect constant currency sales growth to be flat to 2%. At today's rate currency translation is expected to decrease first quarter sales growth by less than 1 percentage point. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share is estimated to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65. At current rates, the negative currency impact on first quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point.","Chris will now make a few summary comments. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Great, thank you, Sherry.","In summary, our fourth quarter played out largely as we expected with a continuation of macro headwinds, similar to what we saw throughout 2019. That said, we saw an encouraging uptick of sales in our newly released products in the fourth quarter.","As we look to 2020, our focus is on execution to deliver improving growth and balancing our industry-leading profitability with the right investments to support our innovation strategy and long-term growth, as well as a consistent return of capital to shareholders.","With that, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not always able to get to everyone's questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Waters Investor Relations team after the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question is coming from Vijay Kumar, Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Chris, just one on, I appreciate all the colors on end markets on the guidance, especially when you look at the end markets right, pharma, industrial, what are you assuming for 2020? Are you assuming pharma, you know some of the weakness we saw in North America customers, is some of that coming back? Industrial, any thoughts on how that segment is that going to shake out? TA did decline. And then I have one follow-up please.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, thanks for the question, Vijay. As you know we had a really variable set of market conditions throughout 2019 and certainly the business mix we have was particularly impacted in part by some of the geographic considerations in China, the large mix we have in LC small molecule pharma and some of the industrial categories. As we turn the page to 2020, our starting point is really just a carry-over of market conditions from 2019.","We're not assuming an acceleration until we see clear change in the market. Within each geography and category we're looking to balance both the opportunities and the risks. With regard to pharma, as you point out, our assumptions include continued robust performance in the large molecule pharma market, which is about 30% of our mix overall and continued softness in the small molecule market, which is 70% of our mix, and that's why we have a - kind of a moderate view of the pharma market at this point.","From an industrial standpoint, the biggest impacts we saw and you referenced TA, were in large polymer and chemicals companies. If you look at our top 20 account say within TA, those are the big global industrial polymers and chemicals companies, they were really soft through the year and particularly in the fourth quarter. Interestingly enough in TA we actually added more new accounts last year than we ever have to try to make up for that, but when the very large companies are down, it's challenging to overcome that.","And I would also say that we do support those same customers through our Waters branded products as well and we saw the same exact phenomenon on the Waters side, as we saw in TA in that industrial polymers and chemicals.","So again, our assumption there is, we're not assuming a major rebound, but we are assuming stable conditions. And so, until we see some different conditions where we thought it was prudent to just assume a continuation of some of the conditions we saw in 2019 into the early part of '20 and we will update as we go along.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful. And Sherry, just on the EPS guidance here, it looks like you're assuming a step down in margins here. I'm just curious, is this a continuation of the gross margin dynamic that we saw in '19 or is the step-up and maybe some of the commercial activities to support the new product launches and why would tax rate step up? Thank you.","Sherry Buck","Yes. So you've got a couple of questions buried in there Vijay, so I'll try to cover them all. We look at our gross margins and really our operating margins. The lower gross margin guidance, I'd say overall is really a function of our topline growth. Peeling that back down a little bit, we think about our gross margin. The two biggest levers on our gross margin are volume leverage and FX. And in years when we've had higher gross margins in the 59% range, we had mid single-digit plus growth. So I'd say the gross margin is really a function of our top line guide.","And similarly with our operating margin and our operating expenses coming into 2020, we're really trying to strike a balance between growth, investment and profitability. And so we're continuing to invest in R&D and commercial capabilities. But we also have some headwind coming into 2020 with normalization of our variable costs and some expenses for Andrew Alliance. So that's our inputs for our guide of 30% operating margin.","Moving on to the tax rate that you asked about, we ended the fourth quarter tax rate more favorable than we were expecting. That was due to some discrete items in the quarter as well as the mix of our profits in our tax jurisdictions, and we're not expecting that to repeat in 2020. So after we came out of tax reform, we're really looking at our tax rate for the business to be in that range of 14% to 15%.","Vijay Kumar","All right, thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is coming from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Chris, I'll start with the guide. If I go back to our conference couple of weeks ago, you were highlighting mid single digits. I know that's maybe a longer-term target. But if I think about the drivers here, you've got new products, you did highlight easy comps. Can you maybe just and your view talk about what it takes to get this business back-to-mid single digit and how much you're expecting from new products this year? In other words, is the portfolio declining if you back out some of these new product launches?","And then also on gross margins, is there any pricing headwind in there? I know you called out FX and fixed cost, but was there any pricing sensitivity as well?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, thanks, Tycho. I appreciate the question. Yes, absolutely. We think the underlying market dynamics are - and fundamentals over the long term are really strong. The underlying secular demand drivers, our unique competitive position and our strategy would over time under more normal market conditions scenario continue to support a mid single-digit kind of long-range target and that's exactly what we were talking about at your conferences, is our belief and our confidence in the underlying fundamentals of the market on a long-term basis.","And clearly, the difference between that and our immediate near-term outlook is simply a function of some of the challenges that we faced in the markets where we're particularly exposed and to be - to not assume that those change overnight that as I mentioned before that the starting point is more of a carryover from the conditions that we saw.","And so, in terms of what it would take to get back up into the mid-single digit plus, it's really a normalization in demand in a couple of key market segments, notably the small molecule pharma segment, certainly general conditions within China returning to reasonable growth, and the stabilization of the industrial markets. We don't have to get huge growth out of the industrial markets. We have to get modest growth out of the industrial markets and then more of a historic norm in terms of the pharma business.","As I mentioned before, the large molecule pharma space has continued to stay robust for the market and for Waters through this whole period, and so it's really about that small molecule space perking up. And certainly with some of the deferred investment in that space, we do see pent-up demand building, but until we see it come back into the market we'll continue to remain cautious.","As it relates to pricing, there is nothing unusual in terms of pricing in our assumptions. We have seen quite stable pricing on the instrument side. We continue to put small increases through on the recurring revenue side. And despite the gross margin dynamic Sherry talked about in FX and all these other things, we've seen no deterioration in our trade margin. So anyway that's how I'd summarize all of that.","Sherry Buck","I'd just like to add on the gross margin for the quarter, just to break that down a little bit. Gross margin in the quarter was impacted by about 90 basis points of FX and the remainder of that lower gross margin year-over-year was fixed cost absorption and mix.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, and then just to flush out a couple of pressure points you highlighted, for China is your assumption for 4.7 that around 3 doesn\u2019t present an incremental headwind? And then any budget delay issues we heard about that in the high-end market from some of your peers? And then Chris separately, you flagged clinical soft, I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on that issue? Thanks.","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, let me try to cover those Tycho. In terms of around 3 on the GPO, the 4 plus 7, let me just quickly summarize. It was about a year ago that we were coming to grips and the market was coming to grips with what was really a pilot phase of the 4 plus 7, 25 drugs in 11 cities. The second round extended that same set of 25 drugs to 27 provinces, more widespread, and accounted for multiple winners per. The third round bidding has been completed. There are 33 drugs that have been bid and this is across 32 provinces.","And so, I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we've seen a pragmatic response from the - from our customers in this. Clearly there is a shift in the market underway from a market that was more purely focused on generic drugs to a market that's being encouraged to scale in that way and maybe in a more price-competitive way to bend the cost curve on generic drugs, while encouraging investment in the innovation sector, and actually a lot of our customers are quite excited about that possibility.","And there is a couple of other regulations coming into the market that should support that, including the 2020 ChP or Chinese Pharmacopoeia modernization of QC methods, as well as revised drug administration law which encourages more R&D.","So I think taking all that into account, our assumption is for stability, but not necessarily a big bounce back, but we think the foundations are being put in place for a sustainable growth picture in the future, and we're investing to take advantage of that where it comes.","I think you asked about high-end capital purchases as well if I understood the question correctly. Towards the end of the year, we actually saw a nice improvement in our high risk mass spectrometry sales because of our new product launches.","The Cyclic IMS and the SYNAPT XS in the high resolution category finished the year on a strong note. Those were back half product introductions, and we're excited about a reestablished leading position in that space, and I think there is opportunity this year.","But we also saw a lot of encouraging activity in the BioAccord which continue to ramp through the year. In fact, we saw - we sold more units in Q4 of BioAccord than we sold in the first three quarters combined. So we think we have a good momentum there. And baking that all in, we're assuming about a point of new product increment in terms of our results into 2020.","Your last point, I think was on clinical. That tends to be a fairly lumpy business. It's a smaller part of our business overall, about 6% of our revenue. It does get baked into our trade class reporting number on pharma. So it was a slight detriment to pharma.","We've grown over more rolling periods, could of three-year periods, the clinical business pretty consistently and pretty well. And clinical business remains a priority for the company and we think there's going to be ramping demand over time for mass spectrometry based assays, particularly newborn screening and therapeutic drug monitoring. So it tends to be a lumpier business and - but we stay very focused on building our technology portfolio there.","Operator","The next question is coming from Dan Brennan, UBS. Your line is open.","Daniel Brennan","Great, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Chris, I wanted to address, kind of, the LC small molecule market where you've obviously highlighted that you're feeling the pain more than peers. Could you just discuss a little bit about market conditions versus share loss, anything on the relative market share trends?","And then importantly, kind of, what drives the improvement here? What are the signpost towards, like, why this market kind of will recover? I know you talked about pill count, generic and population growth, which sounds great, but that's really hard for us to distill that back to the model, particularly as - there's all this excitement over burgeoning our biologic pipelines? Thanks.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Yes, thanks, Danny. I think as we look at the overall market, we've seen consistent feedback from a lot of different sources that the small molecule market has been in a tougher growth environment recently. And what's most different about Waters is that, we have such a large exposure there, with pharma being about 55% of our revenue overall, and small molecule being 70% of that. We're simply more exposed.","As you know, we have a unique mix that's in our LC business, that's pharma heavy and is QC heavy. And so where we play and what we see, we see our share is very stable. We're expecting to the majority of workflows and within our installed base the purchasing can come and go with capital purchasing cycles, but we see the underlying utilization very clearly with our service and our chemistry business.","And our chemistry business, by the way in pharma, has remained very solid through this cycle. Chemistry is in pharma on a global basis is consistently up in the mid-to-high single digits, which underscores the stability of that installed base. And so, our focus is simply to continue to serve our customers and position ourselves to take advantage of when demand returns. Certainly, there have been some unique factors in the pharma LC market. The tailwinds, if you will, in the middle part of the decade, particularly in China and India, yielded some headwinds as we got to the end of the decade with China and India.","And on top of that, the U.S. generic market has been a tougher environment in the last year with a spike in user fees and some litigation noise in the environment. So I think we understand it all very well. We think the market is fundamentally attractive as you point out of your question. We've continued to invest in our portfolio, and we're expanding our technology portfolio and LC, and we're excited for a rebound of that market when it occurs.","Daniel Brennan","Okay. Great, Chris. And then maybe just one follow-up to Tycho's question just on new products. I know you've talked about a point contribution, it still seems pretty modest given the number of new products and the time you spent highlighting the unique features here. So could you just flesh out some details, maybe a little bit? I know you don't want to get in too far in the weeds and the math behind that, but why can't the impact be larger and what should we look for, as kind of signpost towards the success of these new products?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. We're committed to continuing to update these on a quarter-to-quarter basis and like I said, the product launches, particularly in the mass spectrometry side last year were spread across the year the larger systems geared towards the back half of the year, while the BioAccord came in earlier and was a market development process that really began to bear some meaningful fruit by the end of the year.","I'd say in very simple terms, Dan, the overall impact of the new products is somewhat impacted by the market conditions that we face in our business. You can see segments where those products have a more prominent impact have done better, such as the governmental and academic category, the large molecule category. And so as market conditions improve, we should see a bigger impact of new products. But like I said, at the top of the call, the prudent assumption heading into the year is starting point, that's more of a carryover of those market conditions until we see the change clearly in our business.","And so, we have taken, I think, a pragmatic approach to forecasting the impact of the new products, but have - continue to be very, very excited about them and certainly the innovation strategy generally. And the gains in R&D productivity we're achieving inside are really motivating the team and making us excited for what's ahead as market conditions stabilize.","Operator","The next question is coming from Derik de Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good morning.","Christopher O'Connell","Good morning.","Derik de Bruin","Hey, a couple of questions. So first one is, and they're interrelated and the first one is the contribution from the Andrew that's sort of embedded into your M&A for revenue contribution in 2020. And then, just sort of looking at the guidance you've given for the share buyback, roughly $800 million for the full year, $200 million in the first quarter, that by our math, it really to take you about 2 times levered by the end of the year sort of $400 million to $500 million out there. And going back to the first comment on the M&A, is that $400 million to $500 million slug money on the table for potential deal activity to sort of get to the 2.5 times or is it 2.5 times somewhere in the future? Just sort of general thoughts on sort of what's involved in the math?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Derik. I appreciate it. Let me make a couple of quick comments on Andrew and then Sherry can talk a little about buyback program and the leverage targets and so forth, and I'm happy to add to it as well. But Andrew Alliance, we're super excited about that technology. One of the most consistent things that I've heard from customers as I go around regularly is the pressure point on sample preparation and sample automation on the front end of a lot of analyses and Andrew is truly a next generation technology platform in robotics, but also in a cloud ready software to tie it all together and to automate and replicate experiments in a much more effective way.","We're not going to break out revenue at this point. It's fairly modest in the big scheme of the world and we're also trying to get a handle on the opportunity, not just to sell Andrew products, but the beneficial impact that will have on pulling through Waters instruments, which is a big part of our logic.","The integration is going really well and in fact, the Andrew team is in town and I had a chance to sit down with them yesterday and the people within our chemistry organization that are leading the charge as well as the Andrew people, I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Everybody from the organization is staying and working very closely together to take advantage of the opportunity. So we'll give updates as we move along and look forward to sharing some more of that technology with the investment community.","Sherry Buck","Yes, and Derik, just to follow-up on the capital allocation question is, as you know, after we came out of tax reform, we started working towards a more optimal capital structure and we've been executing against that plan over the last couple of years with higher return of capital through share buybacks.","So as we look at going into 2020, there's a variety of factors that we look at. Our priorities from a business standpoint, our performance, et cetera, and really looking at repurchases this year of about $800 million and that would put us based upon our guide we gave today in the low 2 times leverage ratio. And so the factors that could increase us towards our kind of near-term goal of 2.5 times could be M&A opportunities. So we just look at all the different factors, and this is where we set our guide for the full year and we'll look at it each quarter and make adjustments there - updates as we go through the year.","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, Derik, as you know, it's hard to forecast that. Well, we do have a good pipeline. We are very, very selective. We have been involved in a number of different situations and chosen to move forward just very selectively. But it is purposeful and it is proactive and we'll just have to take it as it comes, but continue to focus on those investments in terms of what they can do for our growth, what they can do for the accretion of EPS over time, as well as the returns on invested capital which are our key metrics there.","Operator","The next question is coming from Doug Schenkel, Cowen. Your line is open.","Douglas Schenkel","All right, good morning. Thank you for taking our questions guys. I just want to start on margins, and then I just want to ask a couple of clarification questions as we think about the outlook for growth in 2020. So starting on margins, as I'm sure you guys appreciate a key pillar to the bare thesis on Waters over good times and bad has been the argument that you're pretty close to peak operating margin.","And I can see where your guidance for 2020 feeds into this a bit, especially given I think this would translate into year four of operating margin coming in between 30% and 31%. How would you address that argument? And building off of this, how would you like investors to measure the success of your planned 2020 investments and over what timeframe?","And I guess the third part of this is, for 2020 specifically, and this is really just a cleanup, how much of an impact does Andrew Alliance have on operating margins?","Sherry Buck","Hi, Doug, this is Sherry. I'll start off maybe with the last question there about Andrew Alliance. We haven't done a breakout all the detail line item specifically. There is some impact on operating margin - operating margins and operating expenses and we gave in our guide that it's slightly dilutive to our overall EPS, so a modest amount there.","And when you think about our margins - the 30% margin, one of the things we have in 2020 here is some normalization of prior year variable costs, that's a headwind for us. But as we look at our overall operating margins and getting beyond the 30%, it's really a function of our top line growth. So as we get back to our goal of being mid-single digits or above, that's when we have opportunity for higher operating margins and expansion. And so that's kind of the factor around that.","As far as measuring some of the investments we're making, I'd say two key areas where we're investing for growth is, continuing to invest in our R&D pipeline and that's really continuing to keep our product pipeline robust and bringing new products to market and that will play out in the top line growth, and also, we're investing in commercial capability. So tools for our sales force as far as salesforce.com, it again should play out in top line growth metrics. So that's kind of how we're looking at the investments we're making in the business.","Douglas Schenkel","Okay, that's helpful. And in terms of 2020 growth, you're targeting 2% total revenue growth. I think you talked about new products given about a point. You noted that LC is expected to be stable and TA is expected to return to growth. I think just by process of elimination, this leads us to conclude that you're expecting another year of moderating growth for Waters recurring revenue. I just want to make sure we're not missing something up here, and I guess, cutting to the chase, do you expect Waters Division recurring revenue to get up into the 4% to 5% range or right now are you embedding an assumption that it's going to be a little bit lower than that?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, let me take a comment on that, Doug, and Sherry can add to it as well. I see how you're piecing apart the math, and certainly as we've said, we - our assumption coming into the year is just stable conditions, nothing really better from the standpoint of the type of conditions we saw until it actually comes through in the business plus some benefit in new products.","Actually our recurring revenue assumption is very consistent in the coming year with where we've been. We saw solid recurring revenue performance in 2019 with some improvement over the course of the year, some steady improvement over the course of the year, and a really solid Q4, but all in, the recurring revenue assumption stays about the same.","And really that does imply an instrument assumption that is flat to maybe slightly down at the midpoint, but we think that's prudent and consistent with what we saw in the prior year before the effect of new products. So I think a very balanced outlook that balances opportunity and risk, and obviously looking forward to updating that over the course of the year.","Operator","The next question is coming from Dan Arias, Stifel. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias","Good morning guys. Thanks for the questions. Chris, just following up on the BioAccord, obviously, 1Q can be a choppy spending quarter in pharma just given the budget situation. So are you expecting BioAccord performance to be up sequentially? Do you think that the new product momentum has placements or contributions up quarter-over-quarter or is the 4Q to 1Q spending dynamic the bigger factor there?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. Thanks, Dan. Thanks for the question. Yes, BioAccord, we thought was a good story over the course of the year, a lot of excellent foundational work to get as many customers exposure to it as we could to work into some budget cycles for potential year in money and we saw a nice benefit there. Like I mentioned, we sold more BioAccords in Q4 than we sold in Q1 and Q3 combined.","As it relates to Q1, we've seen quite a stable or modest purchasing dynamic in Q1 on a fairly regular basis and so we're not making any huge assumptions for Q1 as you know from our top line guide of flat to 2%. We're expecting a modest quarter in Q1, consistent with sort of prior year experience, but - so we're not necessarily expecting a sequential move on BioAccord from Q4 to Q1, but certainly we're expecting a nice sequential move from '19 to '20 for the year overall to be very positive for BioAccord.","Daniel Arias","Okay. And then Sherry, maybe just staying with profitability, this could be a little bit of a tough one, but if you just look at the combined margin profile of the BioAccord, the Cyclic IMS and the SYNAPT, is that any different than the corporate average? I'm just trying to understand if there is a benefit to be had there as new product introduction - as your new product contributions pickup?","Sherry Buck","I think as we look at our new products, obviously, when we're bringing new products to market, we're looking at our customer demands and have financial hurdles for those business cases. And so I'd say, that the operating margins on the - particularly some of these mass spectrometry products are at or a little bit above our company average.","Daniel Arias","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question is coming from Paul Knight of Janney. Your line is open.","Paul Knight","Hey, Chris, you had mentioned in your comments that you see a more sustainable market introduction or more sustainable new product introduction per cadence. Can you talk to that statement? Is there - obviously BioAccord seems to be pacing well, what else is different that you make that comment?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Absolutely, Paul, thanks. Yes, we've done a significant amount of work in the R&D function across the company and are really excited about our platform strategy. So we've done a ton of work in the last four years to establish next-generation system components that can really serve as the foundation for systems, more of a systems architecture with our products where we effectively move from a kind of a spot innovation model of one instrument at a time to families and value streams of instruments that can be produced more repeatable cadence into the future and BioAccord is a really good example of that.","So the fundamental architecture of BioAccord which has a common system controller, a new software and firmware architecture, and new hardware components that are durable over time can be spun on a routine basis to bring more capability into the market. The original BioAccord launch a little about a year ago now carried three core applications of protein, peptides and glycans. We successfully launched a new application in December at the end of the year for oligonucleotides, which is a really significant need in the marketplace and has been very well received by our customers, and the BioAccord platform will spin again sometime this year.","And so, as I've commented before, BioAccord as a family, as a value stream, is a platform that we can - we will spend 5 to 7 to 8 to 10 different versions over the coming years depending on customer needs, but to bring new capability in the marketplace on a routine basis. You can certainly apply that same thinking for systems architecture to our other value streams and see where we may be going.","And in addition to that, we've had the chance to largely complete development and to begin the early commercialization process on Waters Connect, which is our next-generation software platform. So we've done a lot of the foundational work to move towards a more sustainable cadence of new product introductions based on more of a systems philosophy and excited about what that will yield.","I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","The next question is coming from Steve Beuchaw, Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Stephen Beuchaw","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I was going to ask you, Chris, one about the topline and then I had a couple of margin questions for Sherry if we have time for that. And Chris, I wonder if you could put a little bit more color around the trends in TA. Did the - the dynamics that you saw in the quarter with some of your larger chemical customers, were those in line with expectations whether it was a surprise and how do you expect that to play into the first half of 2020?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Like I mentioned, Steve, the trends in TA were very much dominated by large polymer and chemicals companies. About two-thirds of our revenue in TA is sold into the polymers and chemicals world. And as you might imagine, we've got some large accounts in that space. I would say, it was softer than we expected coming into the quarter, but directionally consistent.","We saw those trends really all year long among those top customers and that's why I made the comment earlier that we spent a fair amount of time actually creating new accounts and that's actually exciting for the future, because we've opened up some new ground, but some of the newer, smaller accounts that were added in greater number than ever before just can't make up for the big large customers which we expected to be soft at the end of the year but ended up being a lot softer than even our forecast.","I think when we step back and look at the big picture, those customers are still great customers. We have a very strong leading market share position in all these technologies, very strong and stable team. And so looking at the year ahead, we expect those type of market conditions to stabilize.","And as I mentioned, also we did see a lot of the same patterns in our advanced polymer characterization product line and some of the other things we do on the Waters side in LCMS in some of those similar types of accounts. So I think we understand the picture pretty well, and we're just focused on returning that. The other thing we're going to benefit from TA this coming year is we've got some exciting new product launches that we'll talk more about as we get into the year.","Stephen Beuchaw","Okay. Thank you for that. And then Sherry, as we're all trying to get underlying margin and spend trends, I wonder if you might take a stab at, just speaking to the underlying ex-currency operating expense growth, if it was, hey, we didn't have Andrew added in the year, would operating expenses accelerate and by how much?","And then just for those who are wondering about mix dynamics, can you just remind us what the mix spread is at the gross or EBIT line between the TA business and the Waters business? Thank you so much.","Sherry Buck","Yes, just maybe to peel back a little bit your question on the operating expenses. Over the course of the year, Andrew - without Andrew Alliance it has a modest impact. So really the bigger drivers as we look at the increase in our operating expenses and related to our operating margin guide is really the investments we're making in their business, both R&D and commercial capabilities, and then normalization of variable expenses from 2019 are the bigger drivers on operating expense and operating margins. And then, could you repeat your second question?","Christopher O'Connell","I think we might be finishing the call here. So I think we're a little bit over time and maybe Steve's microphone is not live there, so let me just wrap up the call. And Steve, we can certainly follow-up on your question offline here as well as everybody else. But I want to thank everyone for your participation and questions.","Despite the more challenging capital purchasing dynamics in 2019, we remain focused on executing on our innovation strategy and we are excited with our early progress. While our end markets have shown some near-term volatility, we are confident in their long-term growth potential and continue to invest for growth in R&D, commercial operations, and purposeful acquisitions.","So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q1 2020 call, which we currently anticipate holding on April 28th, 2020. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","This will conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call.","[Audio Gap]","Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations.","As is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, then John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the fourth quarter. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.","John A. Ornell","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for Q4 2013. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, in Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings call and webcast is currently planned for January 2014.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Well, our constant currency sales growth rate in the third quarter was 4%, which was a slight improvement over the second quarter's performance, but clearly, moderately below our expectations.","Earnings per diluted share were up 1%, again an improvement from our earnings picture in the second quarter, but still significantly lower than what we have typically delivered. That was due primarily to currency headwinds and somewhat slower organic growth.","In comparison to our business in the second quarter, we saw a slowing of demand from our global pharmaceutical end market, in combination with the strengthening in chemical analysis segment.","The stronger demand for industrial chemical applications was most apparent in the very strong sales growth that our TA Instruments division achieved in the quarter. In total, instrument system sales were up 2%, and our recurring revenues were up 6%.","Turning now to analysis of our third quarter sales. Constant currency sales growth for the Waters Division was 2%. In comparison to the third quarter of 2012, instrument sales were flat, and recurring revenues were up mid-single digits. Product growth in pharmaceutical sales significantly offset a strong quarterly performance from chemical analysis and nonprofit end markets.","Geographically, and for the Waters Division, sales growth in the U.S. was 3%, which included a double-digit decline in government and academic spending. Pharma sales were up low-single digits, a slight improvement over our second quarter results, but not as strong as we had hoped for.","Industrial chemical spending was healthy in the quarter and up high-single digits. This is a continuation of the strength that we saw earlier in the year and indicative of continued but shallow economic recovery.","Sales growth in Europe for the Waters Division moderated in the quarter in comparison to the first half of 2013 and was up low-single digits.","As we saw earlier in the year for Europe, government and academic spending was fairly robust and grew at a high-single-digit rate in the quarter, while our pharmaceutical end market business decelerated from the first-half pace and finished slightly down.","Pharmaceutical weakness in Europe is significantly related to budgetary delays associated with restructuring activities at certain key accounts.","Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan were up nicely in the quarter, as the pickup in government and academic spending that began to materialize late in the second quarter continued through the third.","Governmental supplemental stimulus programs are having a positive impact on our Japanese business. Sectors in Japan, which are not associated with governmental funding activities, remain under pressure, including industrial, chemical and pharmaceutical end markets.","Our quarterly sales growth in China was at mid-single-digit rates and lagged our orders growth rate there. Through the first 3 quarters of 2013, orders growth in China has been at a mid-teens rate. We think the underlying demand for research-focused systems, especially mass spectrometry-based, is strong and should be reflected in accelerating shipment volume, as we close out 2013.","Sales in India were up modestly in the quarter, and demand in that country seems to have stabilized, as the large generic-drug user base appears to be returning to a more normal buying pattern despite significant local currency unfavorable dynamics.","Our sales in the Asian markets, outside of Japan, China and India, were generally in line with our expectations and grew at a mid-single-digit rate, an improvement from what we saw in the second quarter, but still slower than the typical double-digit growth that we have historically enjoyed in periods of stronger global economic conditions.","Our TA Instruments division had a very strong quarter, with double-digit sales growth, primarily based upon strong demand for core thermal and radiology products. Strong sales in the U.S. were indicative of a continuation of economic recovery and of TA's strong market position.","During the quarter, TA continued to augment its technological capabilities and materials characterization with the acquisition of a small, privately held German innovator in elastomer analysis. Through the first 3 quarters of 2013, TA's constant currency growth rate is in the high-single digits, and the third quarter's strong momentum suggests that a similar growth rate may be achievable in the fourth quarter.","Now I'd like talk about the product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew as expected in the third quarter, delivering mid-single-digit sales growth before currency effects.","Column sales to pharmaceutical accounts was strong in the quarter with ACUITY columns, including our new line of CORTECS columns, growing at a double-digit rate within most regions.","Looking at our Waters Division mass spec instrument system sales, we continued to see strong demand in the quarter for high-performance QTof technology systems, including Xevo and SYNAPT platform instruments. New SYNAPT G2-Si features, which we introduced at ASMS earlier this year, have been well received for large biomolecule applications, including proteomics and lipidomic workflows.","Our tandem quadrupole system sales for clinical and applied market applications grew nicely in the quarter, while demand for high-end tandems, used in more classical, small-molecule drug development, slowed in the quarter, due to generally weaker Pharma spending and to delays associated with the valuation of new competitive products. Through 3 quarters of this year, our MS-based system business is tracking at a high-single-digit growth rate, and our prospects look encouraging as we close out the year.","On the chromatography instrumentation front, instrument system sales growth improved from what we saw in the second quarter, but remained below our expectations.","Capital spending delays, primarily from larger pharmaceutical customers, continued to adversely impact new system growth and classical small-molecule research applications.","Looking toward the future, and I'll shortly be talking to you about a very recent product launch that we feel will begin to stimulate chromatography system demand in the fourth quarter and serve as a meaningful growth platform in 2014.","In summarizing our third quarter results, overall instrument systems demand improved slightly from what we saw in the second quarter. However, a combination of factors, including weak public sector demand in the U.S., restructuring activities at some of our large accounts and shipment delays that we saw in China, all contributed to a less-than-hopeful quarterly performance.","Through the first 3 quarters of 2013, we feel that our recurring revenues, our mass spectrometry growth and TA instrument performance were mostly in line with our expectations. And it has been our chromatography instrument systems, primarily for pharma research applications, which have been weaker-than-expected.","On the topic of pharma research, earlier this month, we introduced a quadrupole-based detection technology that is specifically tailored to provide more qualitative information to chromatographers seeking higher levels of confidence in compound identification. This new detector is called the Waters QDa. And it's no coincidence that the name sounds pretty similar to PDA, or our Photodiode Array, the detection technology that is dominant today among chromatographers, especially those in drug research, requiring more qualitative information as part of a chromatography experiment.","The key features of this new product include a small footprint, ease-of-use and a price that truly supports its positioning as an LC detector. Scientists using Waters LC, or UPLC instrumentation, can easily upgrade their existing systems by adding a QDa detector.","In addition, customers in the market for a versatile and high-performance new complete ACUITY system can now purchase a superior instrument, which includes both PDA and QDa detection.","The promise of LC\/MS for a number of years has been on the notion that all chromatographers would one day be able to simply incorporate mass measurement into their existing workflows. However, even with all the improvements and sensitivity, versatility and reliability that were witnessed over the past 2 decades, the perception persists among chromatographers that mass spectrometry is too complex, big and expensive to be considered a practical LC detector module. We believe that the QDa goes a long way in changing that perception and will define a new high-end segment for ACQUITY UPLC.","So at this point, we've already booked orders for the QDa and have begun customer shipments. I look forward to updating you with more information on this exciting product launch on the January call.","But before turning it over to John, I'd like to say a few words about our nonoperational plans. On the M&A front, we will continue to seek smaller complimentary technology opportunities that fit our profitability and growth characteristics. As I mentioned earlier, our TA Instruments division completed a small acquisition. In addition, we also purchased a technology leader in software development for interpretation of ion mobility MS separations in the third quarter. Both acquisitions augment our technology portfolio and will accelerate new system introductions in coming years.","Our strategy on the M&A front remains focused on seeking assets that enhance our technology and market-leading positions within the broadly-defined liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis markets.","As you've heard me say before, we remain focused on strong free cash flow generation. In the third quarter, we grew free cash flow at a rate higher than sales and operating income, and are on track to generate more than $400 million for the full year.","The key deployment of our cash flow has been toward our share repurchase program, and this will likely continue into the future.","In closing, I will reiterate that 2013 has been a challenging year for us. We believe that the slower growth in our business that we've seen in recent quarters can be largely attributed to factors that are external to the company and not related to the core business strategy that has driven our growth for nearly 2 decades.","However, we also recognize the need to adapt to changes in market conditions by continuously refreshing our product offerings, by targeting market segments that offer superior growth characteristics and by judiciously managing our expenses to create business leverage. All of these key factors will be considered as we develop our operating plan for 2014.","Now here's John for a review of our financials and an update on our outlook.","John A. Ornell","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Third quarter sales grew by 4% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 2%, resulting in 2% overall sales growth.","Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 1% to $1.19 this quarter, compared to earnings of $1.18 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.14 this quarter versus $1.12 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.","As I just mentioned, before foreign currency translation, sales were up 4%. And looking at the sales growth geographically, and, again, before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 6%; Europe was down 1%; Japan was up 5%; and sales in Asia, outside of Japan, were up 6%.","On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters Division, instrument system sales decreased by 1%, and recurring revenues grew by 5% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, total sales increased by 15% versus prior year.","Now I would like to comment on our Q3 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Like last quarter, gross margins continued to be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation, capitalized software amortization and a product shift in this quarter towards more QTof instruments versus tandem quadrupole systems.","Operating expenses were up 3% this quarter. On the tax front, a modest shift in production levels and profits favored our tax-advantaged geographies. We brought our effective operating rate for the year to about 14%. Within the quarter, the effect of applying this rate to our year-to-date income added $0.03 to earnings.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $6.4 million, and share count came in at 86.4 million shares, 2.1 million shares lower than Q3 last year, as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.","On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1,699,000,000, and debt totaled $1,294,000,000, bringing us to a net-cash position of about $405 million.","As for Q3 share repurchases, we bought 541,000 shares of our common stock for $55 million. This leaves 423 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For Q3, free cash flow came in at $88 million after funding $17 million of CapEx. Excluded from this CapEx amount is $14 million of spend associated with our new Manchester, U.K. mass spectrometry facility, which is expected to be ready for occupancy in 2014.","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 74 days this quarter, up 1 day from Q3 last year. And in the quarter, and as is typical at this time in the year, inventories increased by $14 million.","Now thinking about the remainder of 2013, we expect conditions will remain constrained for our LC systems business within the pharmaceutical accounts in the fourth quarter. We believe our recurring revenues will provide a foundation of stable mid- to high-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in an overall growth rate of around 4%.","Foreign currency translation at today's rates is expected to continue to depress sales by about 2% in the fourth quarter.","Moving down to P&L. Gross margins in the fourth quarter are expected to be about 59.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be up between 2% and 3%. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $6.5 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 14%.","Our average diluted share count is likely to be just under 86 million shares in the quarter. And rolling all of this together, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.58 to $1.63.","For the full-year then, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $4.92 to $4.97. Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Operator, at this point, I think we can open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken from ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, if you sort of tried to tease out the pharma weakness in terms of some of the different buckets -- whether it's generic, zeros, emerging pharma, traditional pharma, where were you sort of most surprised about the trend that you're seeing? Is it a product-cycle issue? Is it a budgeting issue? Is it a timing issue? We're just trying to get a sense for where you feel like that incremental delta versus your expected sort of come from?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Ross, I'd say the disappointments that we see in generics has been there for a while, largely driven off India and the struggle with the Indian generic accounts. Outside of India and maybe the issues with the large Israel generic manufacturer, which has also been slow, the rest of the generic world has been okay. In the ethical pharmaceutical world, I would say the large dynamic -- most significant dynamic that we're seeing is -- can probably be characterized as restructuring. And the layoffs that are going on, many of which are focused in R&D, that's certainly where we're seeing kind of the most delays and issues in programs that we had identified through our marketing and sales efforts earlier in the year. They're not lost; they keep just being pushed back. We don't see big programs there going to competitors, so we don't think it's a market share issue. We think it's just one of continued delays, as they struggle with kind of dealing with their own economic issues. I'd say that's the main things we see going on in pharma.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe on China, it's interesting commentary. I mean, you're sort of suggesting order rates there continue to be strong, but you're not seeing the pull-through. Is that a distributor issue? Is it a channel issue? Is it a timing issue? Again, I'm just trying to get a sense for -- back in 2, we saw this with another one of your players -- another one of your peers earlier in the year, and obviously, there's been a lot of noise in that channel overall. I'm just trying to get a sense for, particularly on the pharma side, what sort of you the think culprit is in terms of the slow conversion.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. I think the China issue, we really do believe it's more of a short-term issue than a long-term issue. We've seen symptoms like this on the fringe before. But this quarter, it was a more significant issue really with delays in importation and tax paperwork. These orders can come through in significant amounts, but -- and so they indicate the real demand, and the customer is settled on you and has tendered the order. But in most cases, you can't ship it until there's a valid tax certificate, so that the government lab doesn't have to pay a tax or an import tax on that. For the first time, we saw a number of those kind of issues push out from the third quarter. And to the best we can determine, it was somewhat serendipitous. It wasn't indicative of a government edict coming down. And in fact, we've seen some of those ship early in the fourth quarter. So we don't believe -- we're watching it very closely. We still have reasonably high expectations for the China business. We don't think there's anything fundamental on the demand side of the equation, but it was a pretty significant surprise to us that those multimillion dollars of shipments that we thought we were going to come got pushed from the third quarter into the fourth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","The weakness you're seeing in pharma, how much of it, do you think, represents the secular shifts where Pharma is spending money, perhaps the shift from small molecule research to large molecule? How much is that, perhaps, accelerating versus to something temporary restructuring?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That's clearly happening, Dan. They're changing many of their programs from small to large. So we do think we're in somewhat of a shift -- a technological shift. Long-term, that should help us, because those large molecules are more intensely invested in our type of technologies, particularly high-end mass spectrometry. But it's still at the early phase. There's still -- I believe longing out the replacement cycle and a lot of this small-molecule areas, we clearly see somewhat of an aging of workforce systems in the mainstream QC areas. And so whether they're ramping up significantly in the bio area, we've seen a lot of programs, a lot of interest in early-stage programs. But I can't say that we've seen the release of orders that offsets the dynamics that we're seeing in small molecules.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up. Have you seen any opportunities pop up as a result of the healthy capital rates environment in biotech? And if not, why not?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think we've seen some of that, and that's helped to offset some weak conditions in big pharma. But I think a lot of that in those small bio, it's still early phase, and they are still not fully investing at the pace of a big pharmaceutical company. We're seeing good results from that segment of the market in our high-end mass spectrometry, SYNAPT and QTof, and we had a good quarter in the high end in that segment of the marketplace. But you don't see quite the same large volume of QC systems that flow into that segment of the pharma market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Brennan from Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe just one quick one on kind of acquisitions and backlog in the quarter. I think you ended the quarter with double the rate of backlog you typically have. Can you just give us an update on the backlog contribute this quarter? And were there any acquisition impact in the quarter on the top line?","John A. Ornell","Yes. There wasn't anything meaningful on the acquisition impact that rounded this one way or the other. And from a backlog perspective, we were able to take down some of the backlog that we had planned in the Waters side of the business. On the TA side, though, we ended up not quite getting as far as we thought we would. But as you saw in the strength that we had in that business, we ended up with a very good result anyway, and we think there's probably a little more opportunity in the TA side in Q4. Perhaps not so much with the Waters Division as a result of pulling some of that down in Q3. But overall, it wasn't quite as meaningful as we had originally thought as a result of some technical issues that were resolved very late on the TA side. I'd say the only dynamic there, Dan, might be as it relates to China. And we were a bit surprised at some of the lags there and getting those certificates that Doug mentioned. And we're hopeful in the fourth quarter that, that growth can accelerate, and we don't see it -- we might not get back everything that we've put in the backlog in the quarter, but I don't think we're going to add to it in the fourth.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, John, and then maybe just one on LC. So, Doug, can you just comment on kind of the penetration of UPLC today? I think you mentioned in the last questions, the answer to the last question regarding some delays at pharma right now from maybe -- upgrading from older equipment. But can you just give us an update on kind of where you are with the penetration of UPLC? Is that one of the key issues that's been a drag in your LC growth, such that you're just not seeing the uptake of UPLC penetration right now as pharma struggles with some tighter budgets?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Dan, I think it's a very -- it's a hypo question. The ACUITY penetration in early-stage R&D and even middle-stage R&D in pharma continues to be very strong. We see no -- very clear that our belief is that UPLC takes over that market long-term as it continues to be strongly indicative by the facts. The stick-up of UPLC in downstream applications continues to be disappointing, I'd say. I think that's also a function of this reluctance to move processes and kinds of change in restructuring in that industry. Things tend to -- the decision-making tends to slow down. And it's very clear that we've had trouble penetrating into the downstream applications with ACQUITY. So I think that's been a factor in this. I think that -- it's been as much, though, a factor of the whole issue of how pharma have used their investments in the various segments of the market, particularly in a period when most of the major pharmas are going through some period of restructuring. So I think what's -- we clearly continued to see very strong results coming out of our consumables business. No sign that that's slackening off. So overall, we're still very happy with the UPLC, but we're still struggling. We're trying to get the downstream penetration.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital Market.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","When do you think that the diagnostics market and the funding occurring there and the technology breakthroughs in that area will start to increase the growth rate of your business?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, clearly, the clinical applications, if you look over a 5-year period, have been amongst the strongest growth applications for us. Unfortunately, it's still a relatively small piece of our overall revenue base, something a little less than 10% of our revenue base. I think the encouraging thing is that there are many applications that are being worked on in the field, as well as with us, that offer a great deal of optimism long term. But it's -- they're not ready to break as we speak. We clearly see much penetration in neonatal screening, in any rejection -- a rejection in immunosuppressant drugs. We continue to see a lot of interest and activity in pain monitoring and in drugs of abuse testing. Probably even more so -- probably see in drug testing more opportunity to move GC applications into broader-base LC\/MS applications. So, I mean, the level of activity grows significantly quarter-by-quarter, but I can't point to you one specific application that I think is going to dramatically multiply the business in the short term. There's some promising things, but, I think, right now, we'd be happy with saying, we continue to see good double-digit-type of annual growth opportunities. But it'll still take a while for that to make a dent into our traditional analytical laboratory business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So my first question is, over the years, you've developed a well-earned reputation of strong operators. That said, operating income has declined now, I believe, in 5 of the 7 last quarters, as organic revenue lags peers. And it does seem like you may be starting to find ways to cut operating spend below levels you've already cut. Your R&D spend, as a percentage of sales, is below the typical levels of your peer group. Is there any reason we shouldn't be concerned that a focus on cutting operating spend has maybe started to catch up with you in the form of share loss and potentially inability to maintain price?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think the -- that the market facts, Doug, don't take the LC marketplace. I don't -- we track in certainly annual context, which, I think, is probably the only relevant one because quarterly dynamics swing around quite a bit. There's no indication of loss market share. I would say, there's more evidence of gradual accretion in market share in our LC business. So it certainly is a notion that all of us who service the pharmaceutical industry and have suffered through swings in the industrial market have faced the same dynamics, and I don't think we're doing worse. I think the evidence suggests we're doing better. It's doing better in a tough market, I agree. And certainly, in the thermal analysis marketplace, I think the evidence is strong that we continue to gain share. So that brings us to the mass spectrometry piece of the market, and I think that clearly is a tougher call, and that's subject to quarterly swings that can move one way, one quarter, and another way, another quarter. We're clearly -- with our QDa, I think that we're moving things on the analytical benchtop level of the marketplace. We think we have a good strong offering on the high-end. The area that's challenged right now is that pharmacokinetics drug metabolism segment of the pharma market that competitors have launched some new products, I think that's introduced some level of reevaluation in that customer segment. Now to be fair, we haven't been the strongest players in that segment of the market. Our triple quads have been more targeted at the applied marketplace and the food and beverage segment of the market where we continue to do well. So I think, on balance, I think that's a pretty good picture. I think that the marketplace has suffered, and we continued to look to try to manage our resources and our expenses as prudently as we can. Absolutely, when your growth rates are in the low single-digits, that's tougher to do than when they're approaching double digits. But we feel that we have an obligation to manage the business as well as we can. We don't think that we're cutting into the muscle and sinew of our R&D operations. We've always had a very productive R&D organization. And if you go back 20 years, you'll see that we've spent less as a percentage of sales on R&D than almost everybody in our industry, and we're not spending markedly less as a percentage of sales today than we were then. So we think we're rightsized, but we continue to look at all of our projects, and we will not be constrained to spend on a major project that we think pays off long term.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Well that's really helpful, and it's a good segue to my second question. Over the years, you guys have always talked about Waters being a mid single-digit to high single-digit revenue growth company. And we're going -- you're going through a second tough year of -- coming up a little bit light of that. With that said, as we look ahead to 2014, the comparisons will be, again, favorable. You'll have a new product that could accelerate demand in LC. So recognizing some positive dynamics, but also the recent trends, how should we be thinking about 2014, at least at this point? Is it fair to think of it as a mid single-digit growth top line year with same type of 1 or 2 points of operating leverage at the operating line and with typical buybacks below the line that give you a few more points? I mean, is that reasonable, given recent...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That's certainly our thinking at this point in the process, Doug. I think you summarized it pretty well. We do firmly believe that this pent-up replacement demand in our biggest customer segments. Now I thought we'd begin to see some of that work its way through. We think 2014 sets up well with that. We have a great new product that I've talked about here, that's not the only set of new products that we'll be talking about as we move into 2014. And you're right, you hate to say a low base prepares you well for the future but that is the fact. I think cautious optimism about next year is a fair picture.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Butler of Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Doug, on QDa, does that actually substitute potentially for a higher cost instrument? In other words, on an instrument to instrument basis, are you actually achieving less profit? And then the second question, maybe more for John, who I think answered this but I didn't hear. In Q2, there was a roughly $20 million backlog. Did that all get converted in this quarter? Is there still some left or will it not convert?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Do you want to answer part 2?","John A. Ornell","Yes. On the backlog side, Tony, we did convert the piece that we thought we would in the Water side of the business. We didn't on the TA side as a result of a late fix to some of the acquired technologies that were in the works. There was a piece remaining that will come out in the fourth quarter per plan. So in sum total, there wasn't a big difference in expectation versus where we landed, though on the TA side, like I said, there'll be a little bit more coming in Q4 than we originally thought.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","And in terms of the benchtop quadrupole market, Tony, there -- we and others have sold a single quadrupole mass spectrometer for a number of years. If you go back and look at when we acquired Micromass in 1997, and there are still a few of us left here who were part of that deal. Certainly, Art and I would've said that a major part of the strategic benefit to that would be driving mass spectrometry into the benchtop chromatographer marketplace. And early on, we had some success in that, possibly because of its novelty. But that quickly wore off and really carved out a niche in the purification segment of the marketplace, but never really established a position in the workhorse day-to-day chromatography marketplace. So if you look at our single quadrupole sales over the last several years, they've been de minimis. They have been not a significant part of our market, and they're sold into a specialty segment of the analytical marketplace. So as we launch this QDa, and it's launched at a price point lower than the traditional single quadrupoles, so it is attractive to that analytical marketplace. We expect to get a little cannibalization, if you will, of the existing single quad, but not a lot. It largely is aimed at a new marketplace. We might see a little bit of cannibalization of the high-end traditional optical detector marketplace. But we think, for the most part, this is an incremental revenue source, with margins that are right in line with our traditional margins. So -- and with a price point that's higher than the high-end optical system sale but lower than any comparable benchtop mass spectrometer sale. Does that cover all the bases, Tony? Operator, are you still there?","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to touch on the pharma dynamic you mentioned specifically with regards to QA\/QC portion of the business. Can you put some color there regarding how much of the slowdown there was a function of capital equipment spending and budget delays versus just overall volumes on the consumables front? And the reason I ask is just as we look towards next year, I would assume there should be some positive correlation on QA\/QC work as it relates to tell volumes, assuming health care reform actually takes hold. So I'm just wondering kind of what happened this quarter, and what your expectations are going to look like over the next 12 to 18 months as volumes potentially pick up?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure, Isaac. Actually, the QA\/QC segment of the business was okay. It was much more of the research side of the marketplace that was slow, and that was certainly true in the consumables side of the business, where samples, overall, may be a little bit less in India because of the issues facing the generics. But overall, the chemistry business can continue to crank along. So I would say, while we're seeing -- we're not seeing the kind of pickup in QA\/QC moving UPLC in there, the more traditional hardware is doing fine.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then can you maybe comment on the forward view for the next -- whether it's the next 12 months or 24. But just schematically, what kind of a view you have regarding the potential benefit to QA\/QC volumes as healthcare reform goes in the system at least in the U.S.?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think a segment of the QA\/QC market that is likely to pick up is India, where most of that business is QA\/QC. It's not research-oriented. And we know that there's pent-up replacement demand in India. So they still have to work their way through the rupee. They still have to make their way through some regulatory issues, but we're finally beginning to see some of the near-term interest pick up in India that says, \"You've got to get back to investing for that marketplace.\" I think in the U.S., I don't think that the dynamics are as noticeable as we look at it today. I'd say what we're expecting is kind of more of the same as we move through the next 2 or 3 quarters.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And if I can sneak in just one more. Any update on the CEO transition process there?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","An update on the CEO transition process, I think you've read the announcement -- the Board has very active committee that's meeting very regularly, but we're at the front-end of the process with senior management kind of committed to seeing this process through to a very favorable conclusion. I suspect that we won't have a whole lot to talk about maybe for the next 6 months anyway, Isaac, so absent any unusual events, that's what I'd lead you to think about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Doug, just on the pent-up demand in the pharma replacement. How long can accounts delay purchase? And then -- or is that just a structural change that just doesn't return?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think it's not a finite answer, Peter. I've seen big pharma over my lifetime here at Waters go from a very formal 8, 9, 10-year replacement -- stated replacement cycle on HPLCs to 6-year replacement cycles that was either driven by a perception that technology changed or service costs crossed the productivity timeline. It took you too much to keep an existing system operating versus replacing it. I think what we're seeing now is kind of situational as various companies struggle with kind of what they want to be when they grow up, and you see some companies announcing thousands of people being laid off. In times like that, I think decision-making changes and common processes begin to be talked one way or another. I'd say we clearly have aging systems in the pharma marketplace that are aged greater than they were 3 or 4 years ago. And I just think physics demands that those things build up to a point and then have to be replaced, because the technology other than moving towards UPLC, you're not going to change the process of chromatography as your continued workhorse technology here. So I'm betting, and certainly our plans call for that to kick in. And it's a matter of how much and when, but we're pretty certain that it's a dynamic that's going to kick in.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Do you think biotech is just naturally less capital intensive versus pharma? Essentially, are they more efficient, so as pharma consolidates biotech, does that lead to a step-down in investment?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I don't think so. I think, to some extent, at different phases of their development, biotech invests in different technologies. That's clearly true on the process side where fermentation technologies prevail versus typical small molecule synthesis technologies. I think the downstream applications as -- particularly when you move into things like biosimilars, really works in the favor of our type of instrumentation, where you have to do much greater characterization of molecules as they come off QC to prove that you've got the right molecule synthesized. So I don't think long term that we see the investment being significantly lower. We do clearly see it as being more mass spec-centric in the biotech world. But then again, all mass specs require a very strong HPLC or UPLC on the front end. So I think it's a very beneficial segment of the marketplace, but probably takes a little bit longer to develop from the beginning stages through the full production stages.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla from Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","John, you mentioned in the -- in your comments about potential trialing of competitor products in the high-end tandem quad market. I mean, I was wondering if maybe you and Doug could elaborate on that, why you don't think that, that's competitive share loss and just competitive trialing?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, I think that was me who commented on it. We clearly have seen competitive introductions of new tandem quadrupole instruments in the past several months. And we've seen competitors report that they had a pretty good quarter in that segment of the market that they traditionally have the highest market share. So we're not -- I don't think we're terribly surprised by that. As it relates to market shares, though, that's been a marketplace that we haven't penetrated to a large extent. That's kind of been the province of one of our competitors. So when they're coming off several years of slower growth and they introduce a new instrument, I'm not terribly surprised that they do a pretty good quarter of penetrating in the first quarters of their introduction. I think over the next several quarters, you'll see that modulate, very unusual to see fundamental market shares change on the basis of 1 quarter's dynamic. You got to look at market shares over a longer term period, and when the face of a brand new introduction, like somebody has a strong presence in that segment of the market, that's not surprising. Come back and talk to me in 1.5 years and see if it continues to grow at a double-digit rate in those applications, and I think you'll be on firmer ground saying that fundamental market shares have changed. But I don't think that's likely to happen.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I'll definitely try to track you down in 1.5 years if you're still around there.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","As I've disclosed, I think I'll still be here.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Second question is for John, and it's around the gross margin. Last quarter, the gross margin was weak and you talked about a shift from LC to MS, and now you're talking about a shift within the MS in the gross margin, missed our estimate there again. Can you get into a little more detail, maybe peel apart the margin to help us with the underlying dynamics?","John A. Ornell","Sure. Within the quarter, FX is still the biggest play on the margin front. The impact of the yen that we've been talking about, that's throughout the year that remains in place. Euro got a little stronger in the quarter, but still at the end of the day when you add up the currency FX versus prior year in the quarter, there's still about 70 bps of margin deterioration versus prior year, which wasn't much different than what we had anticipated. The software amortization costs that are in this quarter on a relatively low sales base as we ramped that product introduction up, cost somewhere around 30 bps in the quarter overall. And then we had a shift of product shipments in Q3 towards Tof, away from triples. There's a meaningful margin differential between the 2, and that added about another 30 bps, which was beyond what we had anticipated at the start of the quarter, so that explains the -- about 130-ish bps in margin deterioration. And again, that's probably the only difference versus guide our expectation would've been that Tof versus triples piece.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And that product shipment dynamic into the fourth quarter, is that not being taken into account like that -- how is the fourth...","John A. Ornell","No. That is being taken into account. So as I look at the fourth quarter now, I'm assuming that we're going to have stronger Tof business and a somewhat weaker triples business. As Doug had said during the quarter of introduction of new products like we saw in Q3, with a couple of introductions on that front, there's no doubt that people are doing demos, people who are, perhaps, still likely to buy our tandem quadrupole or at least got to look to see what else is out there. So I am accounting for the fact that even in the fourth quarter, we'll continue to see some of that dynamic and we're likely to see better growth in Tofs and triples.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias of UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to ask one of the follow-up on the molecule mix question from earlier. Doug, when you look back at the expectations for sort of the mix of large molecules and the drug classes that you thought would drive the business, is that generally in line with what you're seeing now? Or has the protein drug world sort of evolved in a way that's been different from what you envisioned earlier in the quarter?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'd say in its broadest terms, Dan, it's moving in the direction that we anticipated. All big pharma accounts have talked about moving their development towards large molecules and away from small molecules and have been for many years now. So we're clearly -- have had fair warning about the direction of their development. Certainly, the small pharma startups have been almost all into the field of biotech. I would say the movement of those into therapies has been maybe slower than they and we believed -- and I think the movement into actual production has somewhat slowed the uptake of downstream technologies. So these things have stayed in development longer than people believed. And the movement to biosimilars, which, I think, also is something that's fundamentally attractive to us, has been a little slower than -- a lot slower in the U.S. but slower overall than the industry anticipated. I'd say around the corners and the fringes of the strategy, we've seeing some changes. But in general, this movement, the large molecules, I think, is pretty clearly as described.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe on the strategy side, specifically within the clinical market, how important is partnering there for you guys when you think about how you can be most effective?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think it depends. In terms of the way we approach the clinical market on kind of an application-by-application basis, we've been pretty successful in developing the applications and things like Vitamin D and things like pain monitoring, where we have largely done those kinds of things on our own. Now we partner in the neonatal business, largely because of the proprietary chemistry capabilities that we didn't have, and we saw it as appropriate to access that marketplace. We're -- there are some interesting things that could emerge on the clinical market that I'm kind of not ready to talk specifically about that might well offer big mainstream applications that if we develop it to a point, we might well think of a broader partnering with somebody who's more intense in the clinical or medical device marketplace. I think that's the topic, probably, for some time next year. But in the applications that we think will build into our 2014 kind of budget, those are things that we think we can largely develop on our own.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMC.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to go back to actually one of the earlier questions Doug Schenkel kind of asked about, the competitive dynamics. And Doug, you made a comment that you're taking share, but I think as Doug Schenkel highlighted, you're growing below some of the peers. So can you maybe just talk specifically about where you are taking share in? Also maybe overlay that with some comments on your pricing strategy. In other words, in a world with more budget constraints, do you have to get a little bit more aggressive on price going forward?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. Sure, Tycho. I think -- although I think I laid it out pretty explicitly. I think the growing more slowly than some of our peers, you have to see chapter and verse. I'm aware of one mass spec vendor who after 3 years of below average growth has talked about 1 quarter of good mass spec growth. So if you consider that a massive share change, then, I guess I've got to give you that. In the LC area, we track -- we have information from the industry. We have industry from almost everybody in the world, who imports LCs, and we have very clear indication that not only are we not losing share in the LC marketplace. Again, over a multi-year period, we're in a difficult market, grant you. We're probably gaining share. So -- and I think TA Instruments, although a smaller part of our business, has very clear indications of the same. Now having a good share position in a very tough marketplace can be -- it's not the strongest place we want to be, but I think those are the facts. A lot of -- almost everybody else in our world is doing significant acquisitions that sometimes muddy the field of what organic growth is and versus acquired growth. So obviously, I can't necessarily see my way through all of those dynamics but I try to look at the core data that I can get through other sources. And I'm frankly just not convinced that any of these share moves are fundamental. So if you've got better data than that, I'd be delighted to look at it, but I have trouble getting my hands on it, Tycho.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just how about thoughts on the pricing strategy then? Do you need to be a little bit more flexible on price in a budget-constrained environment?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","The question about -- I guess, should we lower price is the question. I think that's a terrible idea. I think between Art and I, over 30 years in this industry with regularity, both internally and externally. People have suggested that we should cut our prices to gain market share. We've successfully fought off that strategic initiative for 30 years, and I think the long-term evolution of this marketplace is, I think, the same as it was 10, 15 years ago. The customers want performance, they want productivity, they want service, they want reliability and they continue to tell us that price is very low on their list, assuming that they can get everything else. I think we'll stick with the strategy that we've employed. I don't see anything out there that suggests this time is different.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then for John, just 2 very quick ones. As we think about '14, I know you kind of gave some preliminary color on the top line. Any thoughts on the cost side, I mean, given your experience in '13, should we think about a consistent approach to cost management? Or will you bake in a little extra cushion? And then longer term, one of the uncertainties is tax rate, how do you think about your tax rate in Singapore over time? Any preliminary discussions on where that could go?","John A. Ornell","Yes, I think from an operating leverage perspective, Tycho, we would be continuing to look to provide some level of operating leverage, even if we continue to live in a mid single-digit type world. Yes, it's tough to do that, but as Doug said, it's our obligation to find ways to do that, so we'll be able to create operating leverage at that top line rate. We will be able to continue with the share repurchase programs being the fundamental use of cash. And then on the tax rate side, I mean, outside of the R&D tax credit that kind of doubled up this year, I don't see any reason that our tax rate is going to go up or down for mixed reasons as I think about '14. As we think about beyond '15, we do have to consider that we do have a treaty with Singapore that expires, that we will be looking to see how we manage that. That will be an activity that will take place probably mid next year to get ready for that in early '16. So it's a little early to say what -- how much success we'll have on that front. But to the extent that we don't, there's probably a point or 2 of overall impact that could be negative as we think about the rate all the way up to '16. But certainly for '14, I would say, on the side of it, of not doubling up on the U.S. tax credit piece, there shouldn't be a meaningful change in the tax side.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Operator, we've hung on here for a while, past our normal closing date to kind of be sensitive to people's morning schedules. Maybe we could take one more question and then call it a morning.","Operator","Brandon Couillard from Jefferies, your line is open.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Doug or John, if you could just elaborate on the dynamics you saw within the industrial end market between, both the applied categories and the more cyclical chemical industrial accounts? How is it pacing to the third quarter especially within that segment?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I would say that we saw stronger performance in the applied segment of the marketplace. We're seeing a great deal of interest in some of our new technologies, including our new ROI system from the main line chemical industrial players. But it's early on as they think about switching segments of their marketplace. John, in TA...","John A. Ornell","TA had a good quarter actually right across the 3 months, and they had a somewhat strong product line. They had, across the quarter, as we said, a backlog that helped a little bit, not to the extent that we thought, but I would say, right across their end markets. They saw reasonably good demand. They didn't have as much of a government impact in the U.S. as we might have thought. So I would say that as we look at TA's business right across their various segments, there isn't one that stood out as being meaningfully weak. It was across the board.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","John, on the buyback front, looks like a little bit slower activity here over the past few quarters than is traditional. Would you still expect to do 100% of free cash flow in the share repurchase this year?","John A. Ornell","There's no doubt that we did have a situation with the window being closed a bit longer in the third quarter, so the buying opportunity was a bit limited. So we will pick that pace up in the fourth quarter to get that closer to the targeted level of about $300 million or so in repurchases. So I'd say there's -- nothing's changed in our strategy, with the announcement that went out late August, we kept the window closed just to be safe.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Okay. Operator, I think we'll close it off at that point. I want to thank everybody for their attendance and we'll look forward to talking to you again in January. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, and good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call, as is usual, is John Ornell, the Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations.","And as is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's results. John will follow with details of our financials and provide you with our outlook for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.","John A. Ornell","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q4 2012. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 in Part I under the caption Business Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release conference call and webcast is currently planned for January 2013.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to our company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those listed in our schedule, entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share, included in this morning's press release.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Well, our third quarter in total was much like we saw in the first half of 2012. Constant currency sales were up about 2% in the quarter, and within the range that we had discussed 3 months ago. Looking at our results by customer category, we also saw a general continuation of first half trends with pharmaceutical end markets delivering more stable growth in an otherwise challenging demand environment.","In the third quarter, there was a more pronounced spread in our geographically defined segments, with Asia delivering relatively strong revenue growth with more constrained demand in the U.S. than we had earlier anticipated.","Throughout the quarter, we focused our field organizations towards promoting the superior value of Waters' offering in order to maintain a disciplined pricing strategy, and at the same time, we've closely monitored our expenses. These steps, in combination with the continuation of our share repurchase program, allowed us to grow our adjusted earnings per share despite the demand and currency headwinds we encountered in the quarter.","As in prior periods of economic pressure, our recurring revenue, the combination of our service and chemical consumables product lines, stabilized our overall business performance, and in the third quarter solid growth for these recurring lines largely offset a modest decline in instrument system sales. In general, order flow through the quarter did not suggest an overall weakening or strengthening of demand as we approach the fourth quarter.","Looking at the quarter's performance for the Waters division geographically, China was the engine of our Asian growth in the quarter, and we saw nice increases in all segments of our business there. General concerns that we have recently heard regarding a slowing of economic growth in China are not apparent in our third quarter results or in the outlook that we have in the fourth quarter. Our business in Japan declined modestly in constant currency terms, with strength in life science segments offsetting most of the weaknesses in the chemicals sector. India continued to be problematic for us in the quarter, and performed similarly as it had earlier in the year with a weak local currency and cautious customer base delaying instrument purchases in spite of what we see as increasing drug production requirements. We are hopeful that growth in India will show some improvement as we close out this calendar year.","North American demand was weaker than we had hoped for and the slowness that we saw spanned across just about all customer groups. The deceleration from our second quarter's results indicates to us a more cautious and constrained capital spending environment, resulting in more sporadic ordering patterns. At this point, we feel that demand will moderately improve in the fourth quarter to a more positive result, and believe that there are capital budgets that will be deployed in the closing months of the year.","Our European business held up reasonably well in the quarter, especially in light of the macro concerns that dominate the news these days. Pharma was strong in the quarter, and even the more economically sensitive industrial segments performed pretty well. Government and academic spending was under pressure, but do not account for a large proportion of our European sales.","Positive global pharmaceutical demand in the quarter was weighted towards instruments for late development and quality control applications, and we saw a generally solid demand for services in chemistry. Demand for products supporting small molecule therapies seemed to hold up better than for biopharmaceuticals, all suggesting more conservative capital spending plans. We are encouraged to see that our ACQUITY H-Class system continued to move into quality control applications, as this continues to represent a large upgrade opportunity for us.","Our business with ethical and generic firms was more robust in the quarter than for biotechnology-focused companies and CROs. It's interesting to note that the overall growth in the generic business is, in spite of the declines previously noted in India, a business dominated by generic manufacturing demand.","As we saw last quarter, the combination of government and university shipments grew moderately for the Waters division. The growth was geographically variable, with Japan and Asia posting double-digit increases, while North America and Europe were under pressure. In general, governmental spending was stronger than academic, and in particular, we saw a heavy demand for food safety applications from governmental agencies in China.","Looking outside our life science end markets and for the Waters division, demand from industrial chemical customers, those working in companies involved with the development and manufacture of fine chemicals or energy production, was weak in the quarter, with product shipments declining modestly in comparison to last year, but sequentially fairly stable with volume in the second quarter. There is little indication that demand is likely to dramatically change in the fourth quarter. This is somewhat encouraging news for those of us who witnessed much sharper declines for these segments in the late 2008 and 2009 time frame.","For applied markets, food and environmental testing, and aside from the already mentioned strong performance in food safety in China, demand in the quarter was tepid, resulting in flattish sales. We continue to believe that food applications represent a considerable growth opportunity for us in the future.","Looking at TA Instruments, revenue growth moderated to a low-single-digit rate, a deceleration from growth we saw earlier in the year but, I feel, somewhat explainable, given the historic sensitivity of this business to broader economic conditions and the formidable comparison to last year's very strong results. Geographically, business growth was relatively balanced in light of last year's quarterly comparisons. And from a product perspective, weaker thermal shipments were offset by nicely growing biocalorimetry and high temperature systems. I'm cautiously optimistic that sales growth may pick up in the fourth quarter, as newly introduced thermal system demand is promising and as we continue to broaden our application footprint.","Turning back to the Waters division and looking at product line trends. H-Class ACQUITY UPLC and Xevo tandem quadrupole-based, especially our ultrasensitive Xevo TQ-S, continue to represent strong system offerings. For our systems that include mass spectrometry capability, our quadrupole-based instruments, both high performance tandem and single quad devices, saw growth in the quarter. On the other hand, our more research-focused Tof-based technology systems were under pressure, primarily from what we view as a more constrained research spending environment in drug companies, as well as in government and university settings.","Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew organically at a 7% rate in the quarter, a rate that's fairly consistent with longer-term trends, and likely to continue as we close out 2012. Within our columns business, ACQUITY UPLC columns continue to represent a high-growth opportunity, and attachment to our UPLC instrument platforms appears to be holding at an impressive rate that's more than double our typical HPLC attachment rate. We expect that our ACQUITY column growth opportunity will become an increasingly important business advantage as more UPLC-based QC methodologies are deployed.","Now before turning you over to John, I want to say a few words about our planning process as we approach 2013 and beyond. First, we remain focused on a product strategy that's based on driving a differentiated performance advantage. In doing so, we believe that we are uniquely capable of supporting new instruments that are performance-leading and easily used by a diverse and increasingly regulation-driven market. We view advanced software that best addresses scientific workflow as key to our competitive advantage. Accordingly, you can expect to see from us in 2013 and beyond an increasing proportion of our systems designed upon our new unified operating system, a system that will facilitate the migration of UPLC\/MS technology, employing advanced separations chemistries into regulated methods.","We have a rich history of new product innovation that we have effectively translated into industry-leading financial performance. To that end, an ability to modulate spending to accommodate variations in demand due to macroeconomic factors is an important consideration in our planning process. So looking at 2013, I want you to know that our intent will be to execute a business strategy that balances both the long and short-term financial performance of the company.","2012 has turned out to be a more challenging year than we originally envisioned. However, the outlook for the full year that John will be sharing with you will highlight our ability to accommodate uncertainties, and continue to leverage both our P&L and balance sheet. Now here's John with further details. John?","John A. Ornell","Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter sales decreased by 1% and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 4% at $1.18 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.14 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.12 this quarter versus $1.10 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.","Reviewing Q3 sales results in comparison to Q3 last year. Before foreign currency translation, sales were up a bit over 2% from prior year's third quarter. Translation reduced sales by about 3%.","Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were down 4%, Europe's sales were up 4%, Japan was down 1%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 9%. On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales decreased by 2% and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 1% versus prior year.","Now I would like to comment on our Q3 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in at 59.4%, down somewhat from Q3 last year, principally due to foreign currency translation and sales mix. SG&A expenses were down 4% as a result of favorable foreign currency translation, tighter spending controls and lower variable compensation. R&D expenses increased by just 1% this quarter.","On the tax front, a minor shift in operating profits among our legal entities raised our effective operating tax rate to about 16.5% going forward. Offsetting this in Q3 was a slight true-up of our tax accruals from final 2001 returns filed this quarter, keeping our tax rate at about 16% this period. Net interest expense was $5.9 million, and share count came in at 88.5 million shares, 3.6 million shares lower than Q3 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.","On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,448,000,000, and debt totaled $1,148,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $300 million. As for share repurchases, we bought 800,000 shares of our common stock for $64 million. This leaves about $706 million remaining on the current authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. For Q3, free cash flow came in at $82 million after funding $26 million of CapEx. Excluded from CapEx is $9 million of capital spend associated with our new Manchester facility. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, up 2 days from Q3 last year, and inventories increased by $11 million this quarter.","Overall, Q3 materialized largely as expected, with customers' continued reluctance to spend capital freely in these less certain times. At this time, we expect these more difficult conditions to remain in effect throughout the remainder of the year. A continuation of these conditions means we expect sales growth pre-currency effects to stay around 2%, and currency at today's levels will reduce sales by about 2%, bringing sales growth to around flat for the fourth quarter.","Moving down the P&L for Q4. We expect gross margins to be about 60.5%. Operating expenses are expected to be down slightly from Q4 2011. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $6 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 16.5%. Our fully diluted share count for Q4 is likely to be around 87.5 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of these together, we currently expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.62 per share. For the full year, this would result in sales growth of about 2% pre-currency. Currency translation will reduce sales by 2%, resulting in flat sales in 2012 versus 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in a range of $4.90 to $4.95. Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. I think, at this point, operator, we can open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with IS Group (sic) [ISI Group].","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So let's talk about the revenue line. Obviously, the trends you saw in the quarter were fairly consistent with what we've seen sort of in the broader market. I guess, as we think about what we saw toward the end of the quarter and through the jump off point to 4Q, I mean, what are sort of the puts and takes or sort of the opportunities and risks on either, whether it would be by segment or geography, that you sort of see? Because what I'm trying to get at is when you look at the 4Q guide, it's basically almost an acceleration, I guess, on the CapEx side of the business because you have a bit of a tougher comp, and so I'm just trying to see where you see sort of the key inflection points that kind of get us to that 2% midpoint.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Ross, I don't think we're intending to say that we're seeing a real step function in what's coming at the fourth quarter. The pattern of activity over the third quarter wasn't highly variable. It was a pretty consistent quarter. We didn't see a significant drop in demand late in the quarter, as some have talked about. Pretty consistent. Now the fourth quarter is always a big quarter. It's the biggest quarter of the year and it was, of course, last year, but we don't really see much of a change in the momentum that we're expecting in the fourth quarter. And I'd say early on, it's early on in the fourth quarter, but that's reflected in how we're seeing early on in the fourth quarter of this year.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess my point, so if you look at like the U.S., which deteriorated q-on-q, I mean, there's really no reason for that to get better. If anything, with sort of the uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, I mean, most CapEx companies are citing an assumption that, that actually gets worse. I know you have a bit of a different mix than the traditional industrial guy, but I guess, what are you sort of baking into the forecast for kind of that 4Q trend, particularly in the U.S. business?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Ross, just to embroider a little bit, when you look at our geographic segments, sometimes you have to look at specific order details that happen in the base and -- versus what we anticipate happening in this fourth quarter. In the case of the United States, for instance, the third quarter of last year had some very large orders that were unique to the third quarter and didn't repeat in the fourth quarter. We are very strongly anticipating almost a swing in that. So we'll see some large orders come in, in the U.S. in the fourth quarter this year that weren't in the fourth quarter base. So when you annualize or adjust for that, we're still seeing that the underlying trends to be essentially what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. U.S. demand, we don't expect to make a step function, but we do expect that this quarterly adjustment of these large orders will swing in the favor of the U.S. in the fourth quarter, where they swung unfavorably in the third quarter. Does that help?","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I think so. And so, I guess, I mean, if we do see a pause in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, I mean, how comfortable do you feel on the cost front? I mean, you managed costs exceptionally well in the last few quarters. How much more room do you feel like is there?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, we think that our -- as you know, we don't try to empty the bucket in our forecast. We don't -- we try to strike a reasonable course, hopefully erring a little bit on the conservative side as we posture ourselves. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves on the spending line and then have to carve back dramatically. So we think as we plan for our revenue line, we hope that there are opportunities to exceed that, and so we've planned our spending accordingly. I think that probably says it as well as I could say it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just one quick clarification and then a question for you, Doug, and I'll just ask them at the same time. So, John, on the gross margin, can you just -- it looked like mix -- since instruments were down and some of the consumables chemistry were up, I would have thought maybe mix would have been a little bit better, but you highlighted mix as one of the reasons gross margins were down. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about gross margin? And then, Doug, just wanted to clarify on the '13, maybe give a little bit color on what you mean. Is it more balanced approach? Is it you focus maybe on spending a little bit more in '13 to ensure better revenue growth in kind of the out years? Maybe just give a little bit more color as to what you meant by a more balanced approach.","John A. Ornell","Okay. Jon, on the gross margin front, starting first, looking at currency, we had a much more favorable currency environment from a gross margin perspective in the 2011 period. We had a strongly appreciating yen and a relatively weaker pound, and that is always a recipe for higher margins for this business. So against that strong base of comparison, currency translation hurt gross margins by somewhere around 50 bps. Of the remainder, somewhere around 40 bps of the difference year-over-year within the quarter is more of a product story within TA. We saw what we think is a temporary shift away from shipments of some of its higher-end products that actually created a little backlog there that we think comes back in the fourth quarter, but affected margins at TA and for the overall business in this quarter, and a higher service mix within the quarter was favorable to operating margins, but not as favorable to gross margins. So I think as we think about all of that and look at Q4, thinking about margins kind of coming back to being somewhere around 60.5% is where we are currently comfortable.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, John, as it relates to 2013, first, as I'm sure you remember, we don't provide detailed guidance until we finish the fourth quarter and have our conference call in January. So we're going to stick with that. But in terms of, perhaps, what I'm hinting at, is the most difficult time that companies like Waters and many others has in looking and planning and executing the next year is when you have a dramatic change in momentum as you exit the year. As you'll recall, in 2008, as economic conditions rapidly deteriorated, it was a year that was looking very good and most plans were anticipating pretty strong growth, and then all of a sudden, you had to dramatically react to a change in demand dynamics. We don't anticipate that for 2013, and in that sense, I think it's going to be easier to balance and to plan for the coming year. A lot of open issues, of course, for 2013, political issues, economic issues, government spending, but I think, if anything, the planning is going to be more or less on the conservative side, and potentially more opportunity for an improvement as life goes on in 2013. But for us, that means that we can focus on the things that we're good at, where we're able to produce reasonable results in that tough economic climate when we can see it -- particularly when we can see it coming at us at that rate of speed. So I think that's kind of what I mean when I say, 2013, right now, you wouldn't say that there are a tremendous amount of upside opportunities, but it's not going to be a dramatic change, and therefore, I think it's going to be easier to balance your execution next year. Does that help?","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Yes. So I recognize you weren't going to give specific guidance, but that's helpful. So it's not -- I get a few e-mails. They're just kind of comments around, is there a significant change that you're kind of posturing towards for 2013? It doesn't sound like that's the case. I think that's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping maybe you can make some comments on pricing across your various product lines.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure. I would say, with very few exceptions, our pricing has held up across the board. There's nothing in these results that you should interpret as significant price pressures entering into the competitive equation. We have nothing in our gross margin analysis that reflects any significant price concessions, and we don't believe that we stand to gain a whole lot by adjusting our pricing mechanisms, and in particular, places where we have seen weaknesses this quarter, we can't find any lost business because of price. We frankly don't see a whole lot of business being lost to competition that we didn't have in previous quarters. So we don't see a lot of market share changes. It's largely -- our results are largely due to economic factors, not individual competitive factors, I would say.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to revisit the gross margin commentary. I appreciate that the year-over-year comparison was heavily influenced by foreign currency, but I wouldn't think the sequential Q2 to Q3 comparison would have been influenced by foreign currency very much at all and yet, there was a big sequential drop in margins. So I'm curious if you can offer more color into that, John. And then also, what gives you comfort that gross margins will increase sequentially at about 100 bps in the fourth quarter?","John A. Ornell","Yes, there were small differences in currency, Q2 to Q3. Sometimes, there's differences in the accounting for the value of inventory quarter-to-quarter, so it's really tough to get it down to a difference of 10 or 20 bps on the margin line. Certainly, within the quarter, what was different, though, was the product mix piece versus the year-over-year. We did not see, for example, the TA shift away from the shipments of high-end products in the quarter in Q2, so we had a very strong margin, actually, at TA there. So I would say the bigger difference, Q2 to Q3, is more of a product story than it is the currency difference. And for the fourth quarter, typically, what we see is a meaningful pick up year-over-year, really associated with volume leverage of the manufacturing organizations. So we have a relatively fixed base of manufacturing cost. We're producing more. We're getting favorable manufacturing variances on that. So if you go back in time, you'll see that Q4 traditionally has a much higher gross margin year-over-year. We're still expecting about a 40 bps decline versus history, and that's really all currency in the fourth quarter versus the prior year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First, just a clarifying question on gross margins. John, is the 60.5% gross margin guidance for the year or for the quarter?","John A. Ornell","That's for the quarter. That would bring the year to somewhere around maybe 60.25%.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you guys have been managing spend very aggressively. Specifically, R&D spend looks to be tracking to grow at the lowest rate since 2009 this year, and SG&A, factoring in FX, is expected to decline year-over-year in 2012 for the first time since 2009. In your prepared remarks, Doug, you talked about the fact that investors should recognize that you intend to balance near and long-term interests next year. Could you specifically talk about whether or not you can maintain investment at these levels or whether you do need to catch up next year, keeping in mind that you are going to be investing for both the near term and the long term?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, sure, Doug. I think in the R&D area this year, you're probably seeing a little bit of a dynamic of some of the major spend in the software area that we've had beginning to modulate a bit as our unified platform gets completed. So you're seeing some of that gross spend dynamic in software modulated from what it was a couple of years ago. In general, I'd have you believe that our R&D spend is going to be pretty close to the sales growth. So R&D spending over a relevant period of 3 to 5 years is going to grow at about our level of sales. Now we, of course, are able to leverage our R&D spending more than some because of the high consumables rate in our business that doesn't require a high level of R&D spend to support that sales volume. So in a year where our instrument business is suffering the economic conditions that it is, it's the consumables business that's supplying the lion's share of our growth, and that's what you're seeing in that R&D versus top line growth. But long-term, I'd have you modeling R&D growth not substantially different than revenue growth.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And on the SG&A side?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm sorry, the SG&A growth long-term?","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We think that we can continue to, in a long-term sense, a 3- to 5-year period, spend SG&A at a lower rate than sales growth. We're clearly doing that this year, and that's not easy when your sales growth is under as much pressure, but -- and it's -- as I said earlier, it's easier to do when you see this coming at you, and it's not a dramatic change at the end of a quarter going into the next year. So we still feel pretty good at being able to leverage our operating income with lower SG&A spending versus sales growth. It was a challenge this year, probably a bigger challenge than it is in most years, but we achieved that, and I'll have you believe that we're going to strive to achieve that next year also.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So no change to what you guys have said over the last couple of quarters. As long as organic is or constant currency growth is in that 3% range or so next year, you can get a little bit of operating leverage without compromising the long term.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That is exactly my point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to get some color on the trends in the quarter from your large pharmaceutical customers. I know you've kind of highlighted how generics was strong, offsetting some weakness elsewhere, but could you just give us some color after -- certainly, the slow start to the year, I know last quarter, you saw a strong growth, but yet it was mostly, I think, related to the backlog that was up from Q1 to Q2. So any color on just kind of what trends you're seeing from your large pharmaceutical customers would be helpful.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. I'd say we're seeing in large pharma remarkably consistent conditions right through the year, mid-single-digit growth in that pharma category. I'd say, maybe a little bit of flavor is that we see it strongest in the small molecule Q&A area as opposed to the front end of R&D. I think that shows, to some extent, the conservatism of this customer base, focused on what they have to spend on and perhaps delaying some of the more futures. I don't know that, that's a good sign forever and ever, but I think it is something that we're seeing in our sales base, and it's been remarkably consistent, as I've said. It's -- it hasn't wavered too much, right, from the first quarter of this year, up at mid-single-digit demand pace.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one other quick one. Just in terms of applied market trends, I know you highlighted food, which you still see as a positive long-term growth opportunity, but can you as well just kind of tease out some color there? I know last quarter, you had pointed to sustained weakness in some of the more cyclical areas, but kind of what are you seeing today? And has industrial chemical -- have those worsened? Are those performing as expected? And on the flip side, kind of environmental and food, any kind of update there will be helpful.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think the industrial applications are challenged. I mean, I think across the board, the industrial customers are clearly most challenged in their performance currently. We are hearing the most concern about their near-term expectations. Certainly, we saw in TA, which is -- tends to be a harbinger of the industrial markets, that their growth modulated in the third quarter. Even though their orders rate was a little bit stronger than their flow-through rate, it was still softer in the third quarter than in the second quarter. So I think that broad-based, industrial segment is clearly not terribly robust. You saw it today. DuPont results were not great, and I think that's consistent across that large industrial category. I think in the applied markets, it's really a geography-by-geography story. China's food safety business continues to be strong. Environmental applications in China continued to look pretty good. Food applications, on the other hand, in the United States, I think still await a more rigorous regulatory climate. They passed, of course, some of the laws, but the regulations have still not really stepped up to mean that, that spending in the U.S. has gotten terribly robust. So it's largely a case-by-case. But clearly, in an environment where our instrument businesses are running flat to a little down, in the hardware sense, pharma is the biggest piece of that, it's in mid-single digits, and everything else is not terribly robust.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Doug, if we stick with industrial for a minute, in Q2, you made reference to the UPC2 raising eyebrows, I think, for industrial customers. So the question really is, despite new product introductions, does anyone really care? Or are they just so afraid of their future CapEx? And then second, could you comment on -- I guess, in Q3, there was the rollout of the G2S, and what you're seeing there?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure. I'll handle the UPC2, and maybe Art can just talk a little bit about the G2S. The UPC2, Tony, we are extraordinarily enthusiastic about. It's been a good product launch. But to be fair, perhaps not quite as strong on the uptake this year as we thought it might, and I do think that, that reflects to the fact that it's a new product this year. It's not in people's capital base. They didn't plan and budget for it, and I fully suspect that we're going to see a ramp function next year as those conditions change, and we've run the samples. We've got it in our demo labs. The customer reaction to this, I think, is a huge sleeper for us next year. It is something that we continued to be very optimistic on. But to be fair, it's been a little bit tougher slog this year than I thought it would because the results on the actual samples have been so good. But I think we'll continue to report on this. I'd say this is a major opportunity for us in 2013. Art, do you want to talk about G2S?","Arthur G. Caputo","Yes. Yes, the G2S has done quite well for us. It's a -- in that particular segment of high-end mass spectrometry, the key there is to continually evolve your performance. That market space is keyed into that, and the nature of that segment is that they will make investments and upgrade if they believe that the performance of the system is enabling them to produce more information, better results. We have seen that play out with this product. What plays against us somewhat is the suppressed capital expenditures we see in that segment. So we're not getting the kind of velocity that we believe that product would get where capital's more readily available, but we've had some very outstanding results with this product, particularly in metabolite ID and a lot of the important applications that we think represent the future growth opportunity for that product.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Does that cover it, Tony?","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to just continue on that mass spec line for a second, and tie in your earlier comments on price and share. Given that you said you're not seeing much in price competition and share doesn't seem like it's moved much, it's a little bit in contrast of what you said in the past about the mass spec market. So can you just talk about the competitive landscape in mass spec and tell us where you're at?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think, clearly, the mass spec market, particularly the high-end, is the most challenged in this climate. So I think we're clearly seeing the most demand pressure come in that segment. It's also heavily influenced in that high-end in the bio segment of the marketplace, and that seems to be one of the more problematic areas in those pharma applications today. So I have no question it would, say, in our hardware area, the high-end mass spec arena is the most challenging right now, but it's -- we don't see a whole lot of share movement in there. There may be a little bit of share movement. It's tough to tell on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but I think it's more macroeconomics that's affecting our business there than anything else. In the triple quad area and in the single quad area, our results have been quite nice, quite good, and no sign of dramatic price competition. We are holding our own and there's no real competitive news in that segment of the marketplace, I mean.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And, Doug, just a follow-up on Europe. Given that it grew 4% and you called out strength in pharma in 3Q, can you go into a little bit more detail regionally about the pharma strength in Europe?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I just think -- pretty much what I've said about pharma was typical in Europe, that the big pharma business was reasonably strong. It was concentrated in kind of those traditional pharma strongholds of small molecule, traditional drugs, weighted towards QA\/QC applications rather than in major investments in the front end of R&D. So the normal suspects in terms of the big pharma entities in Europe were pretty good. Now 4%, I don't want anybody to think is the most robust conditions we've ever faced, but in a world of tough conditions, it was pretty consistent across the quarter.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Any regional weakness though in southern Europe that you can point to or not?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I wouldn't say of note in pharma. So if -- some of these large European and U.S. pharmaceutical companies have operations in Italy or have it in Spain. We don't notice that they're treating Southern Europe tremendously different for these large pharmaceutical companies. Certainly, local businesses and local government and university spending is affected in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain, I'd say. I wouldn't say in Italy we're seeing terribly deficient conditions, but Spain's a challenge, but not particularly in the large pharma segment. It's more in the everything else segment, I'd say.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jeffries.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Doug, so it looks like your share repurchase pacing slowed a little bit in the third quarter from the first half. Can you give us kind of an update for the year there on the share repurchase front, and then any commentary you can offer on the change in the M&A landscape at the margin would be helpful.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure. John, maybe you can just touch base on share repurchase.","John A. Ornell","Sure. On the share repurchase front, John, we had a target for the year of around 300 million. We had a kind of a front-end loading to that. So I'd say we're probably, from a full year perspective, just about on target to get to that 300 million. So it's a little bit stronger in the first half than the second, but it gives us a little bit of an advantage on the weighted share count to do it that way.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","And, John, on the M&A front, I'd say there's not much news from our perspective. We continue to look at several things in the TA portfolio that offer opportunities to fill it out. Those are not meant to be huge opportunities. And then our more mainstream or in something orthogonal to what we do, we don't see anything that should pique your interest on the horizon.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, great. One follow-up. Doug, in a prior comment, you talked about some software-related spending moderating, but I think, if I'm not mistaken, you've got a pretty material step-up in amortization on the internal software side next year. Is that a true net event in the P&L? Or is there an offset somewhere in terms of lower spending to implement that?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think, true, as we launch new unified products, you're absolutely right that some of the spending for the development of software gets deferred and then amortized as cost of sales when you sell that software, and we'll be selling more of that software as unified started to get launched this year, and gets launched faster next year. But the revenue goes up as those products come on and the revenue is incremental.","John A. Ornell","Right.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","So we don't see the gross margin as being substantially challenged by that.","John A. Ornell","The dollars of gross margin -- we could have a little bit of a...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Right.","John A. Ornell","Depressant on gross margin percentage early on while we're ramping it, but certainly, the dollars should be covered in incremental sales.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","So we don't think it's going to be a material -- something that you will notice in a material sense.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Doug, I was hoping that you or John could maybe just sort of put a little more color around your assumptions on the U.S. improving in the fourth quarter, and the reason I asked is, obviously, all the checks we've done, you would suggest that there's a heightened level of uncertainty around budgeting, and so one of the first things that often goes is capital equipment. So if you kind of compare this year's outlook for fourth quarter, at least in some of these academic and pharmaceutical end markets to this year, if you can you put some more colors on why you're so confident. Beyond just a couple of large orders, why North America should improve sequentially.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure, John, you want to handle some details? And if you need more color, I'll...","John A. Ornell","Sure. Yes, I think as we think about the fourth quarter and look at the various markets, as Doug had said, there was a little bit of a blip in the base quarter in the U.S. in Q3 last year that maybe gave a little different impression on the underlying run rate for the U.S. than what we see in the order rate. But that being said, I would tell you that as we think about Q4 and we look at a 2% expected organic growth rate, we're looking at relatively a flattish performance from many of the developed economies in the world. So U.S., Europe, Japan are all expected to be somewhat flattish in that performance, and the expectation for ROW, Asia, maybe some of Eastern Europe economies are likely to continue to grow at a high-single-digit rate. And so we're not -- we're really not expecting a dramatic change when you think about the developed world in sum total. So I think the U.S. versus Europe dynamic, we're not expecting Europe to continue at 4, but we're not expecting the U.S. to continue at minus 4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMC.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to go back to some of the comments you made earlier on pricing and market dynamics. And it sounds like you're not losing a lot of share here, but I'm wondering, in light of the numbers we've seen within the industry, if you can talk about what you think the underlying growth in the mass spec market is today. And do you see that potentially changing, in other words, accelerating as we move more to diagnostics and some additional applied markets?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure. I think, overall, the mass spec piece of the market is the most challenged right now, and if you're thinking about -- you look across all of us, you're talking low-single-digit growth and probably, the hardware piece is even softer than that across the industry. Of that kind of flattish revenue growth dynamic, Tycho, mass spec, I think, is weaker than HPLC. So I think the marketplace is, this year, down a little bit in the -- just the mass spec piece. Now it's -- you got LC\/MS, and you've got overlaps between what the dynamic is in just the MS piece of the market. But clearly, to the extent that you can isolate those factors, they are higher dollar purchases. Capital spending is more restrained in those higher dollar items. They're not used as much in QC, which are much more resistant to growth. They're more in the discovery segment that people can control a little bit more. So all of those factors say mass spec is more challenged than the LC piece. The LC piece certainly has more service and consumables elements to it, and I think we're seeing that. On the other hand, I think the most challenged is the high-end research-grade instruments. I think that piece of the segment is most challenged. The triple quad into drug metabolism studies, the single quads are less challenged, and that's where we're seeing the best performance.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a quick follow-up for John on margins. As we think about gross margins over the next couple of years, are there obvious levers that you can pull? I mean, we're modeling about 20 bps of margin improvement going out the next couple of years per year. Can you just talk us through where you are in the manufacturing transitions? And are there other obvious levers on the gross margin side that we could be thinking about?","John A. Ornell","Sure. I think as we look at major product transfers and movement of production into Singapore and into Ireland, for the most part, the large amount -- the large transfers of those newer products is principally done. Over time, sure, there'll be -- incremental products will make their way into some of these lower-cost areas, but I would say that it's going to be a bit more of a challenge in a low-growth environment to think about leveraging manufacturing costs and providing meaningful gross margin improvement, and we -- the expectation will be to, at least, hold those gross margins. And to the extent that instruments can grow a few percent or better, then I think we're beginning to talk about a continuation of the volume leverage trends that will provide another 10 or 20 bps per year in what we believe will be a stable pricing environment, but there isn't a step function of gross margin improvement that we're looking at based on product transfers at this stage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","John, just on the U.S. business, where do you focus for growth for Q4 and 2013?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","2000 and what, Peter?","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","For Q4 and 2013, where do you think the growth will be in that U.S. business?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We are not providing 2013 guidance, Peter. You're talking about this year, 2012?","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I'm just -- I guess, when you look at the end markets, if you wanted to rank them, where would you be focusing more resources for various end markets within the U.S.?","John A. Ornell","I think, Peter, as we look at opportunities for the business, we still believe that the area of clinical diagnostics here in the States represents a meaningful opportunity. We think that the legislation that's been passed, but not enacted, in food safety is something that is likely to come to the forefront, perhaps once we get through the election cycle. So to the extent that there's legislation enacted and in place that looks like what's in the EU, I think there's a meaningful opportunity for improvement in sales into the food safety side of the business, so those are at least a couple of areas that we look at and focus on. And I would say, just the new chromatography system, UPC2, is something that is going to impact all markets, including the U.S. So I think from a new product perspective, coupled with the clinical diagnostics and the food safety, those are probably the bigger areas in the States that we look forward to growth in 2013 generally.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","But that comment, I'd suggest, Peter, is really on the margin. Our field resources and our marketing resources, well over 60% of our business is life science oriented. We're still going to focus most of those resources on pharma, CROs, biotech customers who are the main stream of our business. So yes, we have opportunities that arise differentially quarter-to-quarter, but the mass of our resources stays focused on a pretty predictable subset of customers.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And that balanced approach comment, that doesn't infer any changes in the way you're attacking various different markets.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","No, I mean not -- again, we introduce a new product like UPC2. We overweight demonstration activities, and we have to move some people around our laboratories to run more demos that maybe last quarter, they were doing in a different area, but it's really kind of on the margin. That's one of the reasons why we can introduce a new technology like this, and not have to layer on huge amounts of new resource. We can just move them, and then the next quarter, they'll kind of move off that a little bit and move into another area. So it's largely -- still most of their activity is focused in very traditional areas, calling on customers that we don't think are going away. They may have reduced their capital spending somewhat this year, but we've seen this dynamic year over 30 years, and they're not going away. And in all likelihood, they'll be back spending at a more regular pace as we go through future quarters, and we need to pay the same amount of attention to them quarter-after-quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Just was wondering if you could give an update on the I-Class since H-Class doing well, and it sounds like there's good demand potentially for UPC2 going forward. But just curious as to -- is all the UPLC that's being placed, going forward, going to be I-Class? Or just kind of curious just if you could provide more color there.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, sure. Art's right here. I'm sure he'd be delighted to talk about the I-Class.","Arthur G. Caputo","Yes, the I-Class, as we've spoken in the past, is largely focused into the use with high-end mass spectrometry. It provides the optimum separating power and performance that gives it the leverage in those research-type applications. The I-Class represents the top of the food chain amongst our entire ACQUITY line. So this product, which was rolled out roughly 1 year or more ago, has actually done quite well. It has basically enabled us to cover a broad range of UPLC utilization across the market space. We find the I-Class centers in as a very high-performance UPLC system for general applications and research, as I mentioned, largely on the front end of mass spectrometry. And as you move downstream into the development and routine areas, it speeds the method development and the process that enables you to now utilize the H-Class, which we find now going more and more into the development and quality control applications. So it's a great compliment. It fills a very important part of the cycle as we move the market space more and more into the UPLC capability region, and in all is doing quite well, and we've yet to see any competitive product that approaches its capability in that -- in the region of UPLC.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of quick ones. John, when we look at the 16.5% tax rate, is that something we should think about carrying forward?","John A. Ornell","Yes, I'd say at this stage, as we look at the production of products around the world, which really drives this rate, we're pretty comfortable that what we see for a mix right now was likely to be consistent with the mix that we're beginning to look at for next year. So I, right now, would anticipate that, that rate would hold as we think about 2012.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and just -- if we assume that your currencies is where they are today, sort of like stabilized, and we don't get any real changes for next -- going into next year, is FX a help or a hurt to the gross -- to the overall margin of the company?","John A. Ornell","I'd say, right now, I mean, that rate has certainly gone up and down. I think it's getting to be something relatively neutral at levels where it exists today. I'd have to do some analysis to completely prove that, but I wouldn't think that FX from a sales perspective or even from a contribution perspective is going to be a meaningful piece of the overall earnings picture next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You guys mentioned better demand for small molecule focuses this quarter, so I guess, can you comment on budgets in biotech, maybe particularly with respect to smaller companies, where cash is obviously a bit more of a concern?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think our performance this quarter was less robust in that biotech segment of the marketplace, as well as in the biomolecules segment of the traditional pharma business. We don't think that, that's a long-term market dynamic. Almost all of big pharma is kind of torqueing their businesses around to focus more on biopharmaceuticals rather than the more traditional small molecule drug marketplace. What we do think we see in this kind of period when there are clearly capital controls on, the thing that you can cut back on is the new stuff and the new stuff is bio. So -- and you can't cut back on worn-out instruments that are controlling production of the old drugs. So in macro terms, we think that's really what you're seeing kind of in the near-term. Over the long term, and I think that you'll see this in 2013, the bio segment, including the smaller bio markets, are likely to come back into the picture and be a more traditional piece of the pharma marketplace.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can I just ask quickly for you to remind us how much of your business is food safety at this point?","John A. Ornell","Somewhere around 6%, 7%, something like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Just given lots of talk on the mass spec market, I was wondering if you could provide some commentary on how you guys see the liquid chromatography market these days. And then secondly, any expectations you guys have for a budget flush in the fourth quarter?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure. I think, as -- everything in the hardware area and the life science market, I think the hardware business for chromatography is pretty flat right now. It's a little bit stronger than the mass spec piece of the marketplace, but I'd say that's a characterization of the global marketplace, strongest in China, strongest in traditional pharma applications, as I've said. I don't think that there's any indication of significant market share moves in this climate. We don't see it. We don't see major lost business or gained business. Times like this, it's awfully difficult, I think, to see any kind of significant market share move. In times of low demand, people tend to stick with what they've done. As things change or get a little bit more robust, I think you can look for a little bit more swings to new products and new dynamics, but I'd say there's not much change in the liquid chromatography market. Boy, maybe on the fringe there's some, but we can't see it.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","You talked about strength in the generic customer base despite some challenges in India. I'm just kind of curious, what's going on there? What's driving the strength among the generics manufacturers?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think what's going on in generics is what you'd almost expect in India. That's one reason why we think it's inevitable for India to come back, because the generic marketplace is growing pretty robustly as ethical pharmaceuticals come off patent, and you're still seeing the business grow for something like LIPITOR that just recently came off patent and has now substantially gone generic. So the long-term flow of products into the generic market, I think, is unquestioned. What you're seeing is a specific dynamic in India with the rupee being very weak, with government policies in India not being terribly clear. So generic companies and regulatory snafus in Italy [ph] among some of the generic companies causing individual problems. So we think that's limited to India, but almost everywhere else, the generic business is pretty robust. So I think you're going to see India return. Whether it's 1 quarter out or 2 quarters out remains to be seen, but other than that, I think the conditions are still very good for the whole class of generic drug manufacturers.","Operator","Okay, we have no one left in the queue at this point.","Unknown Executive","Good.","Douglas A.

If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Well, good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter 2015 conference call. With me on today's call is Gene Cassis, the Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Water's Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations.","And as is our custom, I will start with an overview of the business then Gene will follow with details of our financial results and an outlook for our business in the second half of this year. But before we start, I'd like Gene to cover the cautionary language.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Well, thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for the third quarter and full-year 2015.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For details, a discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, please see our 10-K Annual Report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.","The next earning release call and webcast is currently planned for October of 2015.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release that we issued this morning. In our discussion of results of operations, we may refer to pro-forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted or non-GAAP financials, included again in this morning's press release.","Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Gene. Well, the market dynamics that contributed to our strengths in the first quarter and largely continued through the second quarter of 2015 and resulted in a 10% growth rate in the quarter and 12% growth for the first half, both at constant currency. Looking at our operating divisions, the Waters Division constant currency sales grew at 11% while our TA division sales were up 2%. Currency translation reduced our overall constant currency sales growth by seven points in the quarter.","Looking at the Waters Division and as we saw in the first quarter, the pharma business performed well in the second quarter, and sales were up 11% for this segment. As we've seen in recent quarters, the lion's share of our pharmaceutical health sciences growth came from smaller specialty and generic customers as well as from clinical labs. Our global chemical analysis business in the Waters Division, which includes food, environmental and industrial chemical markets, was up by the highest single-digit rate in the quarter.","Geographically for the Waters Division, sales in the U.S. were up 10% with strong pharmaceutical and industrial chemical demand, with slower shipments in governmental and academic markets.","Sales growth in Europe for the division at constant currency was up 5%, with weakness in Eastern Europe offsetting stronger pharmaceutical life sciences and industrial chemical results in the Western Europe markets.","We turn to Asia, sales in China, which, as you know, is our largest Asian market were up at a strong double-digit rate with sales to government and academic labs augmenting a continuing trend of strong growth from private sector labs. This marks the third quarter in a row of a very strong sales growth in China. Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan were up 5% in the quarter with strong shipments to government and university customers as well as an increase in demand from chemical materials end markets.","In India, Waters Division sales were up at a strong double-digit rate too. The quarter's growth in India was primarily associated with higher instrument software and service sales to the generic drug industry. During the second half of this year and starting in the third quarter, prior year sales comparisons will become a lot more challenging in India for us.","And I noted earlier, TA Instruments are 2% increase in sales in the quarter at constant currency, which was over a very strong prior year's results. Through the first half of 2015, constant currency sales growth at TA stands at 7%. In the quarter, TA acquired assets related to the ElectroForce Group from Bose Corporation, and the ElectroForce Group designs and manufactures dynamic mechanical testing systems based on a proprietary electromagnetic motor technology.","Now I'd like to discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. The division's recurring revenues, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 9%. Consumables growth at 9% benefited from strong uptake of ACQUITY UPLC column offerings. In addition, we introduced and begin shipping a new sample prep chemistry called Oasis PRiME HLB, and this next-generation solid-phase extraction product will improve and accelerate workflows across a wide range of applications that require high sensitivity and reproducible LC and LC\/MS analysis.","The Waters Division service business also performed very well in the quarter, also growing at 9%. The strength in the service business was geographically balanced and correlated to the general strength that we saw in our pharmaceutical end market.","Waters Division instrument system sales grew at a strong 13% in the second quarter. This growth was highlighted by continued strong uptake of LC\/MS systems that features Xevo tandem quadrupole technology and our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.","LC systems growth for both ACQUITY and Alliance platforms was driven by demand from pharmaceutical customers in the U.S. and India and generally strong demand in China. Our recently initiated agreement with PerkinElmer Corporation also positively contributed to our LC component shipments.","If you look at our new product introductions, we had a very busy quarter at this year's ASMS Conference in St. Louis. We launched the Vion IMS QTof mass spectrometer and our REIMS Research System with iKnife Sampling.","Our new Vion IMS system combines the benefits of high resolution tandem MS analysis and ion mobility separation in a bench top configuration. By adding IM mobility capability, this instrument generates cleaner spectrum by removing interferences and provides collision cross section values for ions of interest. These capabilities allow for new levels of sensitivity and resolution for researchers in applications that range from complex screening studies to metabolite ID and more classical OMEX experiments.","The REIMS Research System with iKnife Sampling drew quite a bit of interest at ASMS. A key feature of this system is the speed with which a researcher can determine chemical and biochemical differences and complex samples without the need for sample prep or a chromatographic separation. REIMS or, as it's known, Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry, is the technology that we acquired last year with our purchase of assets from MediMass. REIMS technology, in combination with capabilities in DESI and MALDI further extends our portfolio of surface ionization technologies.","During our April earnings call, while discussing our health science initiative, I explained how the combination of DESI and MALDI ion sources, embodied in our full spectrum molecular imaging system, provides actionable information about the specific location of molecules on tissue surfaces. With our new REIMS capability, it's the speed of analysis that is advantageous. Researchers now can, for example, quickly determine fraud in food labeling or easily check for food adulteration by simply applying the ionize to a specimen surface.","Staying on the new product launches, in June, we introduced and began taking orders for our ACQUITY Arc system. The ACQUITY Arc system is a modern platform, modular LC system, designed to bridge the performance capabilities of HPLC and UPLC systems, and facilitate method validation for improved workflows in labs running regulated legacy HPLC protocols.","So in summarizing the quarter's performance, I will point out that our top-line growth indicates a continuation of recent business momentum. We were very active on the new product introduction front, and we managed our expenses carefully to generate strong operating results.","And before turning you over to Gene, I'd like to say a few words about our planned leadership transition. On June 25, we announced that the Waters' board of directors appointed Christopher J. O'Connell as Waters' new President, CEO and member of its board of directors. Chris comes to Waters from Medtronic, where he worked for 21 years, and where he served most recently as the President of their Restorative Therapies Group. This is a business with $7 billion in annual revenues and more than 16,000 employees.","Chris' appointment was the successful conclusion of a global search process that, as you know, spanned approximately two years and that surfaced a number of very qualified individuals. We were looking for a new leader who could successfully continue Waters' proven and focused business strategy while creatively looking for ways to successfully pursue new opportunities to further grow our business and create shareholder value.","In Chris, we feel that he meets these requirements and actually so much more. The much more comes from the important fit that Chris' demonstrated management style and engaging personality have with Waters' established business culture, a culture that strongly focuses on customer needs, advanced technology development, and financial discipline. Chris will be assuming his new responsibilities in early September, and I feel confident that Waters will continue to prosper under his leadership.","But getting back to discussing our business, I'm very pleased with our overall business results in the first half of this year. For the first six months, we have grown our diluted earnings per share by 18%, even with a stronger-than-expected currency headwind. And in looking at the P&L, as well as the balance sheet so far this year, I feel that we're well positioned to deliver a full-year performance that's better than our original expectations, all while continuing to invest in our long-term growth strategies and while generating strong free cash flow.","Well, after about 20 years of hosting these quarterly conference calls, it does seem a bit strange to acknowledge that this is my last opportunity to address you in my current role. I want to personally thank our shareholders for their support over the years, and for their valuable insights that have helped us fine-tune our business plans. I also want to acknowledge the efforts of the analysts who have covered, and continue to follow and report on Waters. Over the years, they've made great efforts to understand our business and explain our products, technologies and end markets to potential investors.","But most of all, I'd like to thank the employees of Waters for all the hard work and creativity that they have put into making our business such a success. I think therein lies the true Waters difference.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Gene for a more detailed review of our financials.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. At $495 million, our second quarter revenues increased 10% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth in the quarter by 7%, resulting in 3% reported sales growth. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 8% to $1.32, in comparison to earnings of $1.22 last year. On a GAPP basis, our earnings were $1.27 versus $1.13 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that we issued this morning.","Looking at our growth geographically, and before foreign currency effects: U.S. sales were up 7%, Europe was up 5%, Japan also was up 5%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 26%, with strong demand in India and China. On the product front, and again in constant currency within the Waters Division, instrument system sales increased by 13%, and our recurring revenues grew by 9%. In all, the Waters Division sales were up 11%. For our TA Instruments Division, constant currency sales increased by 2%.","Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins came in at about 58%, consistent with the second quarter of the prior year. Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 1% on a constant currency basis. The impact of currency translation reduced SG&A by 8%. R&D expenses increased by 18% in constant currency, due to ongoing spending associated with new product development and incremental investments related to our health science initiative. The impact of currency translation reduced R&D expenses by 5%.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.6%. For the full year 2015, we expect our operating tax rate to be around 14%; and in this projection, we have not assumed a re-establishment of the U.S. R&D tax credit.","In the quarter, net interest expense was up $7 million, and our average share count came in at 83.3 million shares, or approximately 1.8 million shares lower than in the second quarter last year, a net result of our share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet: Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.2 billion and debt totaled $1.6 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $648 million. Regarding our debt, in the second quarter we amended our bank credit agreement, extending the maturity date to 2020 and increasing our borrowing facility by $200 million, from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.","As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 605,000 shares of our common stock for $80 million. This leaves $604 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase programs.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the second quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $96 million after funding $24 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from this amount is approximately $4 million of investments associated with major facility expansion. This brings our year-to-date 2015 free cash flow to $234 million, as compared to $218 million for the first half of 2014.","Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 75 days this quarter, a decrease of one day from second quarter in the prior year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $15 million as compared to the end of first quarter of 2015, reflecting the normal seasonal pattern.","Now I will discuss our 2015 full-year outlook. For the second half of 2015, we generally anticipate that the drivers of our sales growth in the first half will continue. However, the combination of more challenging quarterly comparisons and fewer selling days in the fourth quarter will likely moderate our second half organic sales growth rate. With these dynamics in play, we now expect to finish the year with 7% to 8% constant currency sales growth. Currency translation for the full year and assuming current exchange rates will reduce our reported sales growth by approximately 6%.","Moving down the P&L, gross margins are expected to come in close to 59% and potentially a little bit better than they did in 2014. We expect to manage our constant currency overall operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rate. However, we anticipate that R&D expenses will continue to grow at a higher rate due to ongoing new product development efforts and incremental spending associated with our health science initiative.","Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. Turning to share count, our full-year average diluted share count is expected to be reduced to around 83 million shares as a result of continued share repurchases.","Rolling all of this together, full-year 2015 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are now expected to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.90. As we think about our expectations for the third quarter of 2015, our guidance anticipates constant currency sales growth to come in at about 7%. Currency translation in the quarter is expected to reduce our reported sales growth rate by approximately 7%. This top-line performance is expected to result in non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted share within a range $1.33 to $1.43 in the third quarter.","Doug?","Douglas A.

Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know what went wrong with that line, but I guess we're all back.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","I haven't heard somebody say my name so frequently since I was probably like 10 years old. It was a little scary. But Doug, I wanted to start by saying you will be missed, and we do hope to see you around town. Very good job over many years, strong execution, great leadership. Again, you will be missed.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","(28:06) Thanks.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Maybe just to start with China, it's clearly been a period for the last few quarters where you've done quite well. Is it possible to help us a bit more in deconstructing how much of this is the favorable comparison versus fundamental improvement? I guess what I'm thinking about is would you be able to walk us through sales and ordering patterns in, say, Q2 versus Q1 and Q4? And more specifically, would you be willing to share what growth assumption is factored into full-year revenue growth for China?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me take the first part of it and Gene can take over the second part. Clearly, we did have a tough three or four quarters in China. We always thought that that with us was a bit more related to banking oversight. We continued to see, what I call, the underlying dynamics remaining strong; the number of quotes, the number of major projects that the customers were initiating. We're still staying at that very strong pace, but you couldn't get those customers to let the orders because they couldn't in any way confirm that the money was going to be there in the end.","So, I would say that was a pretty strong dynamic in terms of the weakness that we saw a year, year-and-a-half ago. We're, I'd say, substantially out of that period. You're never out of it totally, and you can always see this little blips in terms of tightening down on the available banking resources. But I'd say that's why we're perhaps more confident that we have never seen the underlying demand fade. We've continued to see it strong.","The other dynamic I think, Doug, is we've continued to see strong and building, what I call, expat business in China. So, we have a very strong business with American and West European companies that are continuing to expand to that domestic market. That has not fallen off. It's the less than 50% of our business that comes through government's sponsored activity in China, that's what went through a somewhat down cycle, I think, principally related to this banking tightening, and we've seen that leven (31:02) off.","So, I think there's no question that some of the absolute strength that we're seeing is related to the fact that it was a relatively easy comparison. But I still think we're pretty confident about good strong conditions in China as we go forward.","Gene, you want to embroider (31:21) on that?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Doug, as you look at the prior year results, we did begin to see the business ramp in China during the second half of 2014. And that ramp resulted in a double-digit growth in sales in the fourth quarter. So, as we look at the basis of comparison for this year, the basis for comparison does become a little bit more challenging in the fourth quarter. And what we see right now in terms of indicators of strength suggests to us that underlying demand has strengthened. Orders and sales were both up double digit in the quarter that we're reporting on now.","And, but we do expect that as we get into the later part of the year that the sales, the year-over-year sales growth will diminish a bit because of the improved \u2013 because of the more difficult base of comparison. Now having said that, and if I think about the guidance that we've given for the full year, what we do anticipate that growth rate in China will be closer to the low double-digit through the second half of the year.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. And then just a couple of clean-ups and I'll get back in the queue. Did the PKI deal impact sales in the quarter or is that mainly just orders? Based on your wording in your prepared remarks, it sounded like it was probably the latter. And then, the other question is just on book-to-bill. I don't believe you provided it. It sounded like orders were as strong as sales, but given the strength of instruments in the quarter I just wanted to see if there was anything of note there. Thank you.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. No. Just in terms of looking at backlog build in the quarter, orders and sales were approximately the same in the quarter, so there was no meaningful difference there. As we take a look at the PKI, I mean, what we talked \u2013 what we're \u2013 on the quarter that we just reported on, we did see orders and sales in that partnership and the trajectory that we're on gives us confidence in the original projection that we had for the full year and that is that the incremental benefit of this partnership will result in about 1 point to 100 basis point improvement for Waters' shipments this year.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. So, Doug, I looked it up; since 1996, you've outperformed the S&P by 2400% -- not a bad showing, I guess. So you can leave quite happy. I guess as we look at the macro, industrial markets most of the indicators are kind of pointing south and then your business tends to be more insulated.","As we progress into the third quarter, particularly, on the equipment side, just because you've had such strong instrument sales, any areas where you'd point to a little bit of softening, you don't have a kind of basic industrial exposure, maybe on the chemical side where there's a little bit of caution? I mean, I wouldn't think it's playing in any of the traditional healthcare markets, and it seems like the emerging markets are fine.","So, I'm just trying to figure out if there's anything that's maybe a little bit at the margin trending, maybe downwards since everything sort of seems like it's quite strong.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ross, I think you can point to the quarter that we just had. The business most affected by the industrial \u2013 the classic industrial market is the TA business. And TA had low single-digit growth. But for the half, TA was up 7% organically. And so, yeah, I think you might see a little bit in the classic industrial chemical, the DuPonts and the Dows of the world probably seeing a little bit of weakness there.","For the Waters Division, though, the industrial category \u2013 in our world that includes environmental labs, the food and beverage, food safety \u2013 and the conditions there are pretty robust. So, I'd say, on the margin maybe you're seeing a little bit of a struggle in some of those industrial accounts. But even at TA, I think it's more that we're in the tail end of their product cycle. You're going to see really an uptick in their new products next year. And yet, their organic growth is still hanging in there. I don't think there's any share loss there. So, it's a marginal thing. I don't think it's anything significant to be worried about.","Gene, do you...","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","No. No. I think that's well said.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Obviously, Doug, you're leaving the business in tremendous shape. It's having some of its best run on the new product side in some time. It feels like one of the last things from an end-market perspective you've focused on was sort of the diagnostic opportunity you've talked about the last few calls. I guess, where do you see that going for the business? Are you happy with the progress you're making? Do you feel like some of the skill set of the incoming CEO will play well to that market, just given his background? I'm just trying to get a sense for, do you feel like that piece takes Waters to kind of the next level over the next 10 or 15 years?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's insightful that we clearly have talked a lot about this broad health science initiative. But I think it's best for us to think about it in that context, that it isn't a diagnostic opportunity; it's really looking at almost the soup-to-nuts opportunity, as we work with some of these very large integrated healthcare systems and research centers that are making large investments on both the basic research side, the translational medicine side, then on the therapeutic and the diagnostic side.","So, I think what it's worthwhile to think about is that, we're looking at a broad range of products and technologies that are coming to bear in all of those fronts. And if we're successful, we'll see that working on the front-end with these thought leaders leads to opportunities in that whole string of downstream health science opportunities.","We see that probably right now more in the first couple of phases in that, in the basic science and the beginning of translational medicine, in the big academic medical centers, both here and in Europe. The diagnostic opportunities that have been very robust have been in areas like pain management, where there are \u2013 seems to be growing by leaps and bounds.","So, there's no question that Chris O'Connell has superior insight into that whole marketplace from a different technology point of view. But just recently, we secured a significant order in the OMIX area in Europe, and it turns out Chris O'Connell has a very intimate relationship with the leader of that institution. So, we're finding more and more the overlap and the connection, the geographic knowledge, that Chris has in the application universe. So, we're very happy with the way that's all coming together. That help?","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Thank you so much, Doug.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Dan Leonard of Leerink. Sir, your line is open.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. I guess to the high level, I'm curious in the EPS guidance revision, why it wasn't a little bit higher, given the big uptick in your organic revenue growth guidance?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You want to take that?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Let me make sure I got your question, Dan. Your question is about the guidance?","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. You took EPS guidance up at the midpoint by a percent, yet revenue guidance was up at a much healthier clip, from mid-single digits to 7% to 8% for the full year.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Well, yeah, I mean, we -","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","So, I'm wondering what's going on.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","We talked about the full year at 7% to 8%, and the guidance before was mid-single digit. I think that we fully recognized that a lot of the growth that we've enjoyed, especially in the last quarter, is from \u2013 Asia was a significant driver of that growth, and we know that the bases of comparison become a little bit more challenging in the second half. And we had very strong first quarter. And in part, we benefited from three extra selling days in that quarter, and that becomes a headwind for us in the fourth quarter, where we have fewer selling days.","So, I think that, as you begin to look at those two factors, and still understand that the fourth quarter is a little bit a ways off, and it probably makes sense to, if anything, err a little bit on the conservative side. I think we're very comfortable with the top line and the bottom line. I'd just like to mention that the bottom line, the EPS guidance that we provided, also factors in a little bit more headwind from currency than we had anticipated the last time we gave guidance.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, how meaningful are areas like pain management, therapeutic drug monitoring more broadly, and drugs of abuse testing? How meaningful is that as part of your business, because it seems like that's an area that's coming under increasing reimbursement scrutiny in the U.S.?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's a growing part of our business. It's \u2013 right now, the whole health sciences area of our business is not quite 10%.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Right.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, it's fair to put that into that context, and pain management is a piece of that. I'd say the pain management piece and therapeutic drug monitoring, all-in, is a significant part of that health science initiative in the United States, and it's a growing piece outside of the United States \u2013 not a big piece of Asia, but a growing piece in Western Europe.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful context. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Sir, your line is open.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning. I kind of want to make an echo joke, but I guess I'll hold off here. Two questions for you: first, just regarding the strong pharma demand that you've seen in the past couple of quarters, I was just wondering if you could comment on where you're seeing that come from. Is it more \u2013 do you see more coming from replacement demand or new system placements? Because I'm trying to just gauge how much \u2013 what the legs look like for this type of strong growth from pharma, and then I have a follow-up?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well Steve, it's interesting, because the growth is not coming from our classical big pharma accounts. Those accounts are low-single digit to flat. So, most of our growth is coming from specialty pharma, generics, big and small biotech accounts. And I'd say most of that is new initiatives, the volume-based. It's not significant. You always have some replacement and maintenance business that goes on \u2013 and throughout that. But I'd say the prime initiative here is more forward-looking spending.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","And the one thing that I would add, Steve, is that the recurring revenues, the service and the chemistry business that we have, is disproportionately weighted to the pharmaceutical side of our business because of the number of samples that are running in applications like quality control. So, what we're seeing in terms of strong demand on the chemistry side and on the service side is indicative of high utilization rates of instruments in the installed base, and that's very encouraging. That shows you that there's an underlying demand based on the requirement to one run more samples that I think does have legs to it.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Very good. Thank you. And then just as a quick follow-up to, I believe with Dan's earlier question, Gene, I think last quarter, you were assuming roughly $0.43 of an impact from FX in your guidance. You alluded to a slightly larger FX impact, and just was wondering if you could quantify what your assumption is now for the EPS impact from FX in the full-year guidance?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think if we look over the year-over-year comparison, we had about a $0.13 impact of \u2013 from FX in the second quarter and about $0.21 for the first half of the year. The guidance that we gave assumes another $0.13 in the third quarter and probably something closer to the first quarter of impact in the fourth quarter as we begin to anniversary some of those strengthening \u2013 I'm sorry, weakening of foreign currencies.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Jon Groberg of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Can you hear me this time?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","All right. I hope I don't break the phone system again.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Be careful, Jon.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","So, first of all, Doug, let me offer my congratulations as well, and good luck with what comes next for you. And I'm sure we'll continue to hear from \u2013 from all the good things that you're doing. So, I just, one, wanted to clarify on the health sciences, I think you said, so clinical, translational \u2013 however guys define that, you're saying it's just under 10% of sales. How fast is that growing currently?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's pretty much -","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","It's in double digit.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think we're comfortable with saying it's a good double-digit grower currently.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Doug, I guess, maybe two questions on just the leadership transition that I think are relevant. I mean, one, what do you think that your employees are going to be most excited about when it comes to Chris joining the team? And two, you have to look out there, as I'm sure you do, and there's been some pretty hefty multiples paid in the space for, what I would call, trophy assets and especially those that have some good long-term growth drivers like in the biopharma space, and given your position in that space, I'd put you in that category. So, I guess, how did you think about \u2013 how did you think about whether or not the right move was not to explore maybe another value creative opportunity as opposed to moving forward with the plan that you did from a CEO standpoint?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, Jon. Let me take them in reverse order. You've followed us for as long as anybody and you know that from time immemorial, people have talked about Waters could be acquired by someone else and fit into their portfolio. And we've always pretty much ignored that talk and focused on what was right for our business and our customers.","And from the point a view of our board and our management team, there was \u2013 we never believed and still don't believe that there's anything that a bigger, larger, more diversified company brings to us that would help us as opposed to continuing to pursue these initiatives on our own. So, from our perspective, we can well imagine why somebody might drool over the opportunity of adding Waters to their portfolio. It didn't do much for our strategic advantages.","So, you can say, okay, but at some price, any company can be acquired. We all know that. So, I can tell you that no one has seriously tempted us along those lines. So, I think you can never say what'll happen in the future. But I and the board believe that the future for Waters is incredibly bright. You probably know that I never think our stock is fairly valued. I think it's always undervalued. And so, the opportunities to prove that \u2013 when we were trading under $100, people thought we were maybe as far as we could go. And when we're at $130, who knows \u2013 people probably think the same thing.","But I look at our opportunities. I look at what we can grow over the next three, five years, and I think our shareholders are going to be very fairly rewarded by continuing down this path. And I don't think you have to look too far at the companies who have been acquired over the last three or four years. I mean, I'm going back to Millipore. When the body of politics thought that they got such a great price for their business, you look at the market today and if they had held on there as individual companies, they'd be trading at much higher prices than they settled for in the acquisition world.","I don't think you have to look too far to some of those companies that still haven't closed yet to say, gee, I wonder what their future was as stand-alone businesses rather than settling for what looked to be a strong premium. So, I'll get off my soapbox, but I don't see anything that's likely to change our perspective in the near term absent somebody just deciding to really open their purse strings. And having said that, now I forget about your first part of the question.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","That was really helpful. The first part was what do you think, because again, Chris, coming kind of from the outside, doesn't really have a lot of exposure to even investors as we've spoken to those who've known Medtronic for a while, so just kind of what do you think employees or maybe investors are going to most appreciate about Chris?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it's interesting because in going through the gamut of the recruitment process, Chris talked to, certainly, first, me, and then the succession planning committee and the search firm and the rest of the board, and then the rest of the senior management group. Never had I imagined it would be so universally positive about the credentials of somebody coming into this job particularly as we all know the incumbent is so highly valued.","So, Chris did an outstanding job of selling himself to the organization. And starting out, Chris had no real appreciation for Waters or our background and history. Since we made the decision, Chris has had the opportunity to broaden that association. We've gone down a level or two in the organization, had some dinners. And the organization has been kind of universal in their initial reaction that Chris seems to be a Waters' cultural fit.","And, look, you do the best you can, and I'm sure Chris has done the best he could. He clearly has knowledge of this whole healthcare environment, he's well-traveled, he understands the Asian markets from the perspective of Medtronic. But that perspective isn't that different from our perspective. So, I'm sure Chris isn't going to be a Doug Berthiaume clone. I don't want him to be. The company doesn't want him to be. He'll bring his own expertise and his own desires and strategic abilities.","But I think he clearly, to the best of our ability and his, conforms to what we think the initial perspective of the CEO of Waters is going to be. He values the same kinds of things. He brings the same cultural values to the table. And I just think he's going to be a great fit.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Doug. Congrats again.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Joel H. Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. Thanks. It's actually Joel Kaufman in for Isaac. Just taking it back to the pharma end markets, could you maybe parse out the growth rates year-to-date in QA\/QC versus what you're seeing in R&D?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's been balanced, Joel, but the one thing is that we've had a very growth in India. I think you've heard that in the first quarter call as in the second quarter call. And the growth there is generic pharmaceutical demand and it's mostly quality control related. But as you begin to look across our pharmaceutical end market and begin to segment our business out by small molecule applications, large molecule applications, it's been very balanced actually.","But QDa has been a wonderful product in terms of helping us in the small molecule world, and for people who have been primarily and only focused on looking at what's happening on the large molecule front. This brings us back to a reality that small molecules continue to be important, and we're seeing that with our QDa demand. So, I'd say that if you factor out the exceptional growth that we've seen in India during the first half and then begin to look at the pharmaceutical demand, it's pretty \u2013 it's been pretty balanced across the whole spectrum starting from discovery through QA\/QC.","Joel H. Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Then just a follow-up in Japan, I think you guys grew there low-single digits in the first half of the year. Could you just maybe provide your expectations for the back half and maybe how the comps shape up in the back half of the year?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. On Japan, yeah, our expectation is that the results that we've seen year-to-date are probably indicative of what the results will look like for the full year. There's been some interesting dynamics in Japan in that you had an interesting year last year in terms of looking at governmental spending. You had a favorable comp on governmental spending, so it looked optically very strong in the quarter that we just reported. We had a strong pharmaceutical first half of 2014, though a little bit softer. But I don't think it's indicative of a change in demand as it is to just some of the details of the basis of comparison.","In general, we're expecting the performance that we've seen in the first half of the year to continue through the second half of the year.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think, in general, we think of Japan as being a mid-single-digit grower. It can bounce around the mid-single digits. But I think our long-term expectations revolve around that expectation.","Joel H. Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Matt Mishan of KeyBanc. Sir, your line is open.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry. We didn't hear the name.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Matt Mishan.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Matt?","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","KeyBanc. Yep.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Okay.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Gene. Hey, Doug. Just hearing your thoughts on the value of companies taking out that you think would be like greater in the marketplace maybe as like stand-alone a couple years later. Does that make you more interested in being an acquirer?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Not particularly. Depends \u2013 but it all depends on the assets, Matt. I still \u2013 my general rule of thumb that some people debate and some agree with is that we're perfectly willing to consider adding to our portfolio as long as it's in an area that we think we know something about, that we can manage and it doesn't dilute the existing business. I just don't \u2013 when we think that we have the opportunity to grow in the high-single digits organically, that buying something that dilutes that for the short-term pleasure of cutting out administrative costs doesn't appeal to us. It does to some, but in the end you're going to look at those serial acquirers and say, gee, where's the evidence that adding assets to them took their 2% or 3% organic growth rate and doubled it or tripled it.","And as you know, it's hard to find great evidence of that. It's not hard to find evidence that they can cut costs for some period of time and grow their earnings in a very-low-interest-rate environment. And who knows, maybe that'll turn out to be the wisest business strategy that we've ever seen. But it's not something that has ever particularly appealed to me. And so I think, as long as we see the opportunity to continue to do what we do and deliver superior results, we think it's the better strategy.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, can you remind us of your NIH exposure and any thoughts you have on some of the legislation making its way through Congress? And also, with some of your newer products, you think you can punch above your weight a little bit if that legislation goes through?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think the NIH opportunity is very marginally, potentially positive to us, but Gene will tell you why. Gene?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think our exposure is \u2013 roughly 1% of our sales are related to that spend level, and it's heavily weighted towards our higher end mass spectrometry product. So, it tends to be a relatively small percentage of our business, and it tends to be somewhat lumpy, just given the high ASPs.","So, as Doug said, it's a \u2013 it's likely to be a marginal positive. We're encouraged that some of the technologies that we've introduced during the first half of this year, as we move into what is historically \u2013 third quarter is usually a bigger quarter for U.S. governmental spending. We think we have a pretty good pipeline of customers that are interested in some of our more recently introduced technologies.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, and great quarter.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Hi. Can you hear me?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Can you hear me? Oh, great. Doug, congratulations. It's been \u2013 covering the stock since 2001, so it's been a pleasure working with you. Two real quick questions: First, how should we think about R&D spending going forward? Do you think \u2013 should we model it higher than constant currency growth rates in the out years? And what is the overall impact for M&A for the full year in constant currency growth? Thank you very much.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, clearly, this year is going to see a spike in R&D growth compared to what's happened historically. And that's specifically related to the health science initiative and things like REIMS and DESI. You're likely to see another year of higher-than-average R&D growth, but I don't see that extending deeply into the future. It's not going to mitigate in the next couple of quarters. But we don't see \u2013 we see a number of initiatives, that are going on right now, that will keep that tail rising.","Now, having said that, down the road we could initiative something else and have to rationalize it and incorporate it into the budget. But with our current momentum, I'd say, yeah, 2016 is likely to see a somewhat higher R&D rate. But I think then it begins to mitigate.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And the M&A impact for this year?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think the question, Derik, was the impact of M&A for this year?","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thanks, Gene.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","2015, we expect that M&A will be a very small part of the growth story, maybe we're looking at 20 or 25 basis points.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ms. Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Ma'am, your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Anthony (1:04:33) in for Amanda. Just a couple of quick questions: First, you guys have definitely had a number of new product launches this year. Would you be able to add a little bit of insight, or maybe some more specifics, regarding the potential growth impact for this year and potentially next year as well, regarding these new product launches?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","I think your question, if I could just rephrase it to make sure we heard it correctly, was that you're trying to understand the impact of new product launches on this year and next year? Is that...?","Unknown Speaker","Correct. Yeah, primarily on revenue, correct.","Unknown Speaker","Corrrect.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Well, if you look at our full-year, high-single-digit growth rate expectations, certainly in the Waters division, the \u2013 I'd say it's kind of a classical year, in terms of the effect of new products versus continuing new products. If you just look at the products launched this year, you're talking principally, so far, products in the mass spec arena. Of course, you have things like the QDa that were launched previously that is still in the early phase of the cycle.","So, I would say that we're in a representative year. It was a strong launch of capabilities, but it's \u2013 I'm not prepared to say precisely what the new product effect was.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, as you look at the growth rate that we're enjoying this year, there's clearly a positive market dynamic. Over the years we've been a pretty good proxy for the strength in health sciences and pharmaceuticals. And I think what you're hearing from us, as you've heard from some other companies in our space, is that's a healthy market. And I think we are getting at least our just share of that market health.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","And there's no new product introduction that stands out as dramatically affecting this growth rate. Let's say you've seen products across the consumables space with the glyco product and the mass spec triple quad area has been healthy, the single quad with the QDa. It's pretty broad based. (1:07:34)","Unknown Speaker","Well, if I could just ask one additional follow-up on that. You guys definitely touched on China and on India, and how the strength is \u2013 or the growth has been incredibly strong. Would you be able to elaborate, actually, a little bit more specially on India? Is it \u2013 and I guess like, even in terms of \u2013 not just revenue, but even on the expense side. I know that you mentioned that with SG&A, you're expecting \u2013 well, I guess that is more my question, in terms of, what would be the potential impact on SG&A as you continue to expand in India?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if I understand the question, our India business is a very well-run business. So if you look at its level of profitability, it's certainly very well run and above-average level of operating profits. And what's happened in India in the last couple of years is they ran through a period of very weak currency, a kind of political uncertainty and in the past \u2013 and a period when a number of generic drug manufacturers ran into regulatory issues, some of them quite serious.","And in the past 12 months, the result of trying to cure those regulatory issues has been that they've turned to us for significant help in both the software area, the service area or qualifying their instruments and doing extra work. We still see the effect of that currently. We also see an improvement in the political environment and a somewhat stabilizing of the rupee.","So, all of those things have kind of moved positively. I'd say, again, we have a very strong position in India. I think they're coming out of a period when those generic drug manufacturers were kind of treading water in terms of their capacity. And we're pretty optimistic about their long-term business plans to add to capacity and capabilities.","So, l'd say, while, yes, we've come through a period where we had pretty soft businesses, so easy comparisons, I think we're going to through a period when the underlying demand is still pretty strong and the profitability of this business is very good. So, I think...","Unknown Speaker","Well. Excellent. Thank you for the detail, guys. And once again, congratulations on a great quarter. Thank you.","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. And operator, I think we can take one more to make up for our echo start, but we're well passed the 9:30 difficult stopping date. So, I think one more would be appropriate.","Operator","Okay. Our last question is from Ms. Miro Minkova of Stifel. Ma'am, your line is open.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on your retirement, Doug. Let me start with just the guidance for the fourth quarter. Considering that it's still kind of early on, and you probably don't have a great visibility on the pipeline, but you are implying like basically flat revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Gene, maybe remind us, how many fewer selling days you have and what is the breakdown between the fewer selling days, the tougher comps in India, China and the balance between the underlying demand that you're seeing?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So, Miroslava -","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the selling days \u2013 go ahead, Gene.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. There's three fewer selling days in the fourth quarter -","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Compared to the fourth quarter last year.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","...quarter of last year. And typically, Miroslava, those affect most dramatically the recurring revenues. So, then the recurring revenues are roughly half of our business. If I take a look at what's the positive effect was of a similar \u2013 of selling days moving in the other direction in the first quarter, it was probably 2% or 3% points on the 15% total growth that we had in the first quarter. So, as you begin to take a look what the assumptions are for the rest of the year, we talked about the third quarter having a top-line growth rate of 7%, and the full-year guidance pretty much assumes a 3% or 4% growth rate in the fourth quarter.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much for the color. And maybe if I could ask you on the ionize \u2013 the REIMS product that you unveiled at ASMS, just curious as to if you gotten any earlier \u2013 any early feedback from potential clients on the reception of the food testing application? And how \u2013 any expectation for this product for the next 12 to 18 months?","Douglas A. Berthiaume - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say the initial reaction to the food tasting \u2013 the food safety application is very positive. But I would caution you to say that we're still in the early phases of putting that technology in the hands of these customers. And as you know, the applications there widely vary. So, whether you're talking about milk products or you're talking about meat products, you're typically talking about different situations with different customers.","But I would say rarely have we seen an initial level of interest with the ionized applications in food safety. It's a very strong. But you're not seeing that currently in our order rate. We do think that that's coming.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter and full year 2013 conference call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, our Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, the Corporate Vice President. Well, today, I will start with an overview of the business. Then John will follow with details of our financial results, and Gene will conclude our prepared remarks with an outlook for our business in 2014. But before we start, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.","John A. Ornell","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q1 and full year of 2014. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions, and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, in Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2014.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to meet most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Well, I'm pleased to tell you that our 10% constant currency revenue increased in the fourth quarter with a strong finish to 2013 and resulted in full year sales growth that was in line with the growth that we had anticipated early in 2013. When you look at the full year, stronger academic and industrial spending, significantly in overseas markets, offset less robust sales growth for new instrument systems, primarily to our larger pharmaceutical accounts. These trends were reflected in our product line revenues in 2013 as high-end mass spectrometry sales to academic and biotech accounts were particularly strong, while growth for core chromatography instruments recovered late in the year. Throughout the year, our recurring revenues grew consistently, indicating increasing utilization of instrument systems in the installed base, a positive indicator for future new system sales. Across our markets, pricing held up well in 2013, while gross margins were slightly off from last year's due to a combination of currency effects and product mix dynamics.","Through the year, we judiciously managed our expenses while adding required field personnel to support customers in rapidly expanding regional markets. In addition, we supported several new product introductions for our Waters and TA divisions. Our slower-than-typical growth in operating income was largely due to the sharp decline in the Japanese yen.","So for the full year, our adjusted earnings per share were up moderately to $5.04, an increase that's significantly less than typical given our history of generating operating leverage along with accreting EPS through our share repurchase plan. However, the effects of currency translation in 2013 largely explain the slower-than-expected growth in adjusted EPS.","Looking at the fourth quarter. Constant currency sales in the corporation were up 10% for both instrument system sales and for our recurring revenue. The strength that we saw in the quarter was balanced in terms of major geographical regions and across our product lines. In comparison to our results earlier in the year, the most pronounced improvement was in the sales growth for Waters Division instrument systems, which were up close to 10%. Geographically and for the Waters Division, sales growth in the United States was up 9%. In the quarter, we saw a meaningful improvement in pharmaceutical spending and very strong industrial, chemical and food analysis sales. For the full year, sales in the U.S. were up at a mid-single-digit rate.","Sales growth in Europe for the Waters Division was up 5%. As we saw earlier in the year, for Europe, academic spending was robust and grew at a strong double-digit rate in the quarter. Year-over-year European pharmaceutical sales were slightly down in the quarter due to a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2012.","However, looking at this segment from an orders growth perspective and sequentially from the third quarter results, the trends are encouraging and more reflective of the improvement that we saw in the U.S.","Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan increased in the quarter due to continued government funding -- funded spending, primarily for research-focused applications. The strength in Japan was particularly driven by strong sales of high-end UPLC\/MS\/MS instruments for academic institutions.","In the quarter, our business to industrial and pharmaceutical firms continued to be under pressure. We are hopeful that new stimulative policies will revive the export-driven industrial firms in Japan and consequently result in higher levels of scientific instrumentation demand.","Our quarterly sales growth in China returned to a solid double-digit rate, as administrative delays that we cited in the third quarter were largely resolved and allowed us to return to a quarterly revenue growth more in line with the true business momentum in China. In the quarter, shipments of instrument systems to governmental and academic customers drove our growth with end-use applications for life science research, food testing and environmental monitoring all showing strength.","Sales in India were down modestly in the quarter compared to the 2012 quarter, but shipment volumes were a little higher than in the third quarter of 2013. All in and in light of improving ordering trends, we continue to feel that demand in India has stabilized and hold out optimism that 2014 will be a better year. For the full year, our business in India did grow modestly in contrast to the contraction in sales that we experienced in 2012. Our sales in Asian markets outside of Japan, China and India grew at a double-digit rate, an improvement over the growth we saw earlier in the year and a promising sign as we enter 2014.","Our TA Instruments division had a very strong quarter with double-digit sales growth primarily based on strong demand across the entire TA portfolio of products and for most large regions. Core thermal and rheology instruments provided a strong foundation for growth for the year, and in the fourth quarter, TA closed on 2 small acquisitions and is quickly integrating these product technologies into the TA lineup.","Now I'll discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. The division's recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. Chromatography consumable sales were strong in the quarter and grew by 10%. A portion of this growth can be attributed to a favorable base of comparison and an extra selling day in the quarter. However, the lion's share of the growth is associated with the continued rapid uptake of ACQUITY columns, including our new line of CORTECS column. Our service business also performed very well in the quarter and grew at a high-single rate with balanced strength across all major regions of the world.","Looking at our Waters Division mass spec instrument system sales. We continued to see strongest demand in the quarter for high-performance QTof technology systems, including Xevo and SYNAPT platform instruments. New SYNAPT G2-Si, which we introduced at ASMS last June, continues to be well received for large biomolecule applications. At the same time, our UNIFI-enabled Xevo QTof instrument is potentially defining a new market category for bench-top accurate mass and rapid screening mass spec capabilities for both life science and applied market applications.","Sales of our tandem quadrupole system were flat in comparison to a strong quarter last year. Sequentially, demand was up nicely from shipment levels in the third quarter. And in 2013, we enjoyed our highest volume for tandem quadrupole technology instrument in our history.","In all, 2013 was a strong year for Waters and mass spectrometry. We believe that we have secured a differentiated position in research Tof technology, by uniquely coupling high-resolution ion mobility capability and advanced software to deliver an easy-to-use and performance-leading SYNAPT system.","On the chromatography instrumentation front, I believe we delivered an impressive quarter from multiple perspectives. Importantly, we saw a nice recovery in demand from our pharmaceutical customer base and classical small molecule applications to augment an already healthy trend in biomolecule applications. The improved demand was primarily for ACQUITY UPLC systems.","In addition, our chromatography instrument growth was further enhanced by higher sales volumes of application-tailored systems, including our proprietary UPC2 instrument and our advanced polymer characterization system. Both of these systems are quickly reaching a point where larger accounts will begin to incorporate multiple systems into their research workflows.","Most significantly, we are excited and pleased with the recent introduction of a new detection technology that's attractive for existing and new customers alike. When we last spoke in October, I noted the introduction of the Waters ACQUITY QDa, a compact, easy-to-use and cost-effective LC detector, incorporating quadrupole mass spectrometry technology and enabling chromatographers to augment their current instruments with molecular mass measurements. The reception of this product among our existing base of users has been very positive, and the QDa was quickly recognized as providing a unique set of attributes. This positive first impression was quickly followed by a high interest to purchase, quickly generated purchase orders and instrument deliveries. Interestingly, we found that about half of early orders for the QDa included the purchase of complete Waters systems rather than a mass detector upgrade to an existing instrument. We are confident that our late year introduction of this technology has provided our customers the opportunity to include this new system in their 2014 capital purchasing plans. Thinking more broadly, this new detector is enabling a first-of-its-kind LC system for both research and routine testing applications, much in the same way compact bench-top GC\/MS technology transformed the gas chromatography market.","So in summarizing our fourth quarter results, overall instrument system demand improved meaningfully from what we experienced through the first 3 quarters. Though weak public sector demand in the United States and restructuring activities at some of our large pharmaceutical accounts continued to serve as headwinds, global strength in public sector segments, along with continued improvements in industrial demand, contributed to a strong quarterly result and allowed our full year sales growth to recover to a solid mid-single digit level. Throughout the year, our recurring revenues delivered predictable and profitable growth. Our TA Instruments business continued to perform well, contributing positively to the top and bottom line of the corporation. Sales growth in this division suggests that TA is doing a good job at attracting an increasing share of the improving advanced materials characterization market.","We see factors that suggest to us that market conditions in 2014 will be as good or better than those of 2013. U.S. public spending for research is likely to improve with the issuance of an NIH budget. The gradual global economic recovery will hopefully continue, and China will continue to invest in scientific infrastructure.","In addition, India may return to more reasonable growth, and we are encouraged that our technologically differentiated products, such as the SYNAPT G2-Si and our new ACQUITY QDa, will contribute -- will continue to attract new orders even from a challenging pharmaceutical end market.","Before turning it over to John and Gene, I will say a few words about our nonoperational plans. In short, please expect more of the same in terms of our capital structure and deployment of our free cash. On the M&A front, we will continue to seek smaller complementary technology opportunities that fit our profitability and growth characteristics. Our strategy remains focused on seeking assets that enhance our technology and market-leading positions within the broadly defined liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis markets. The key deployment for our cash flow has been toward our share repurchase program, and this will likely continue into the future.","In closing, I believe we have a great business and a proven long-term strategy. A commitment to the continuity of this proven business model has allowed us to both maintain market leadership and strong returns over the last 20 years. As we look toward the future and consider our capital allocation, research priorities and management development plans, we plan to proceed in ways to best ensure that the core tenets of our strategy will be preserved and consequently, our customers, employees and shareholders best served.","Now here's John for a review of our fourth quarter financials.","John A. Ornell","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Fourth quarter sales grew by 10% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 2% resulting in 8% overall sales growth. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 7% to $1.70 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.59 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.65 this quarter versus $2 last year. And a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.","As I just mentioned, before foreign currency translation, sales were up 10%. Looking at this growth geographically and again, before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 10%. Europe was up 5%. Japan was up 3%, and sales in Asia, outside of Japan, were up 15%. On the product front and in constant currency, within the Waters Division, instrument system sales increased by 9%, and recurring revenues grew by 9% as well this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, total sales increased by 16% versus prior year.","Now I would like to comment on our Q4 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margins came in as expected at 59.5% and continued to be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation versus prior year. SG&A expenses were up 6% this quarter driven largely by sales greater than forecasted, generating higher variable compensation expenses in several geographies. And R&D spending was up by 8% driven by heavier project expenses on new products.","On the tax front, our higher sales performance was weighted towards our higher tax rate geographies and brought our full year tax rate to about 14.5% versus our previous expectation of about 14%. Within the quarter, the effect of applying this rate to our full year pretax income reduced our earnings per share by about $0.04.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $6.9 million, and share count came in at 86 million shares, 1.9 million shares lower than Q4 last year, as a result of our continuing share repurchase programs.","On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1,804,000,000, and debt totaled $1,323,000,000, bringing to us a net cash position of about $481 million. As for Q4 share repurchases, we bought 755,000 shares of our common stock for $75 million. This leaves $348 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For Q4, free cash flow came in at $133 million after funding $23 million of CapEx. Excluded from this CapEx amount is $8 million of spend associated with major facility construction.","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 69 days this quarter, down 2 days from Q4 last year. And in the quarter, inventories declined by $16 million.","So for the full year, 2013 sales grew by 5% pre-currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales by 2%. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 2% to $5.04 per share versus $4.93 last year. 2013 saw significant currency headwinds from the Japanese yen. All in, currency translation reduced earnings by $0.27 versus prior year. Without this currency effect, the 5% sales growth would have resulted in approximately 8% growth in non-GAAP earnings before diluted share.","And now here's Gene with the current financial view of 2014.","Eugene G. Cassis","Well, thank you, John, and good morning all. Looking ahead to 2014, our outlook generally assumes the continuation of the market conditions we saw in 2013. Specifically, we are envisioning stable increases in our recurring revenue sales in combination with a modest increase in the growth rate of our instrument shipments. This growth in instrument sales is associated with an assumption of a continued improvement in the overall global economy and from our new product initiatives. We feel these factors combine to support a mid-single-digit organic sales increase for 2014. Currency at today's rates and in light of our sales and cost footprints should be about neutral to our revenue and operating income growth.","Moving down to P&L. Gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2013. Volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains may likely be offset by increases in costs associated with the startup our new U.K. mass spectrometry center and potentially with higher initial manufacturing costs for new products planned for introduction in 2014. At the projected sales growth rate, operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate that's slightly less than sales.","Moving below the operating income line. Net interest expense is expected to be around $28 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. This projected change in rate is higher than our 2013 rate and assumes that United States R&D tax credits that reduced our '13 rate by more than 1% will not be extended into 2014.","We plan to continue our share repurchase program throughout this year at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of about 85 million shares.","Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2014 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $5.35 to $5.55.","Now looking at the first quarter of 2014. We are estimating that sales will grow at a slightly slower rate than for the full year. This expectation is due primarily to a strong quarter -- first quarter in 2013 and accordingly a moderately more challenging base of comparison.","Currency at today's rates is about neutral to sales and the stronger euro being offset by weakness in the Japanese yen.","An increase in our effective tax rate will adversely impact the first quarter's earnings. Last year, in the first quarter, the rate included a recognition of both a 2012 R&D tax credit, as well as one in 2013. The 2012 credit was only passed by Congress early in 2013.","So rolling all these factors together, we expect the first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15.","Thank you. Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, Gene. And Amy, I think now we can open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So Doug, I'm just thinking about it a little bit, and I'm sort of bouncing back a little bit between calls, but I know you've highlighted the strength of QDa, and I'm just trying to think as we move into '14 here, new products overall. What else can we expect? And what would you expect their contribution to be to the top line kind of over the next 12 to 24 months?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think, Jon, we've got a number of things that we're aiming for, essentially the Pittsburgh Conference and ASMS, which is middle of the year. But of course, the QDa, we really only saw their results in the fourth quarter, and so you'll wind up seeing 3 quarters of incremental growth from the QDa in 2014, which we expect to continue to provide some momentum there. We're not prepared to discuss the mass spec introductions that are coming at ASMS, but I think you can tell from our history to expect some new innovations showing up at ASMS. We're also seeing continued momentum coming out of our introduction of the UPC2, which had good results in 2013, and we think we have many years of momentum that are likely to come out of the UPC2 product line. And finally, TA, which has substantially refreshed their product lines over the last 1.5 years, as well as incorporating the series of their small acquisitions over the past 12 months, we think we can get incremental growth out of the TA product lines, too. So that's all very encouraging, I think.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And maybe just to follow up, tying it into end markets. Are you seeing any end markets, in particular, more receptive to buying some of these new products as opposed to the ones that are maybe still a little bit more conservative?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think what we saw as we came through the latter part of 2013, I think the key words is broad based. We saw excellent response across most of our major product segments and saw an improvement in the broad-based pharmaceutical market. Now granted it wasn't so much big pharma that, that came from, as much as specialty pharmaceuticals, biotech. But I'd say we're certainly seeing a good response to our technologies across the applied markets, as well as the broad-based life science markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wondering if you can dig in a little bit more on kind of pharmaceutical trends, Doug, John and Gene. Maybe just give us some color. I know, Doug, in your wrap-up, you mentioned there was just still kind of a headwind, although they did improve this quarter. So kind of what are you seeing from kind of your large pharma in terms of restructuring kind of trends and spending, whether it be geographically or just any anecdotal color to help us?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'd say we're continuing to see slow momentum out of the large integrated pharmaceutical companies. We still see a lot of restructuring going on there. I would say looking for silver linings, the response to the QDa across big pharma in the early stages has been very good. We haven't seen them move en masse to the technology, but I'd say we're very hopeful about the response in big pharma to the QDa and what it can mean across their applications. But clearly, the strength that we've seen in the broad-based pharmaceutical life science market has been really outside of the big pharma accounts, particularly strong in CROs, particularly strong in biotech. So that's what we saw coming out of the latter part of 2013 there.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then would you characterize your 5% organic as kind of a conservative guide given the improvement in NIH funding, PMIs globally improving and some of the trends that you're seeing with your customers?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I'd say we're trying to be as realistic as possible as we always try to be in looking out 12 months. I think, clearly, we saw a bit of an inflection in the fourth quarter, and that's very encouraging coming late in the year as to what that might portend for 2014. But one swallow doth not a summer make, so we want to put probably a little bit more behind us before we take that kind of growth to the bank. So we're trying to walk that line. We'd clearly like to overdeliver on our forecast. That's been hard in some years past, and maybe we're set up to reverse that trend. But I think we've got to put a little more experience behind us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I'm curious what your thoughts are. I know you made some comments on India, but in general, just sort of in emerging markets, we've obviously seen a little bit of wobble to start the year, just given some of the currency movements. And then specific to India, I'm curious how much of it is sort of folks coming back online versus sort of a steadying out in the rupee versus just easing comps to kind of give us a little bit of recovery there.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Ross, I think India has clearly got a mixed bag of all those things. You've got these companies trying to restructure their financials based on a weaker rupee. You clearly have a weaker basis because of the lower growth in 2013. You've got regulatory issues that I think they thought were behind them. But I'm sure you saw the FDA issues with Ranbaxy just this week, so they're probably not all behind in India. But I'd say we're cautiously optimistic that we'll see better results in 2014 than we saw in 2013, and it's the sum total of all those factors. We don't see -- contrary to losing market share, we think we're holding our own to cautiously gaining some market share in a tough market. So that's the India story. The emerging markets is definitely not homogenous. We see areas in Asia that you'd characterize as emerging as generally very strong. Our performance outside of China and India in Asia was very good. And China, if you consider that emerging, continues to -- boy, coming out of 2013, we have just as many discussions with major opportunities in China as we had going into the year. So we see no underlying factors in China that suggest a slowing there. In the areas of the Middle East, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, very good performance, so continuing signs of those emerging economies investing in our kinds of technology. So as I say, I'm sure I'm being redundant, but there's broad-based results that we saw, and kind of building confidence is happening across the developed areas and most of the developing world. I'd say Brazil continues to raise question marks. It's a big economy, and we've seen some delays in Brazil, but it's not a big part of our emerging markets. So outside of that, I'd say, generally, it's all positive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you [ph] quantify the impact of currency mix and amortization on the gross margin in the fourth quarter?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","John, you want to...","John A. Ornell","Yes. Currency had about a 50 bp hit in Q4, about 70 for the full year.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And amortization for...","John A. Ornell","The UNIFI we're talking about?","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes.","John A. Ornell","Yes, UNIFI was about 35 bps in Q4 and about 50 for the full year.","S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then could you elaborate on the impact of the Japanese stimulus funds in the fourth quarter in terms of revenue contribution? And should we expect a tailwind from that program into the first half of the year?","Eugene G. Cassis","Yes, I -- if I take a look at the -- this is Gene -- the factors that grow growth in Japan were heavily weighted towards government and academic spending. In fact, as we look at the first quarter, we're expecting some new tax policies to potentially get some of the pharmaceutical and industrial chemical spending to a higher level. So it's not clear that the government spending on research will be as pronounced in calendar year 2014 as it was in 2013. However, the base of comparison that we have on pharmaceutical and industrial chemical spending is favorable this year, and we see both economic stimulus policies by the Abe government as well as potential tax reform as being a positive to the nongovernmental spending in Japan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Wondering how your communication and [ph] half of the QDa were full system sales as compared to bolt-ons. How does that compare versus your expectations? And do you think that's sustainable?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'd say it's probably twice as loaded towards full systems, Dan, than we anticipated. We thought early on, particularly in a tough capital market, that customers would be more inclined to find available capital money to satisfy the detector but probably not the full system. And what we found was clearly a little surprising to us, that even though this wasn't a system that we had available so that they could budget for it this year, they were very strong in finding end-of-the-year money in order to purchase.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And your views on the sustainability of that, of the QDa to pull through full LC sales?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We don't think -- it's a mixed bag. I -- we certainly believe that there's a major opportunity to have accounts upgrade their detector, installed detector base to this new technology. But at the same time, it looks like, early on, there's going to be a strong desire to bring in full system. So I think what we're likely to see and what we could well be seeing is these accounts are buying 3 or 4 and bringing in full new systems in order to get the experience on it and to expose it to their broader laboratory environment. And once that happens, then they may proliferate it into their more existing systems. That could well be what we're seeing at this stage of the game.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Doug, when do you think the diagnostics market is meaningful? And where do you feel your, I guess, competitive position is as you kind of look at that in the years ahead?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Paul, I think, long term, we're very optimistic about the opportunities of our technology to serve emerging needs in the diagnostic marketplace. As you know, in -- we kind of satisfy it in a niche basis today with immunosuppressant drug monitoring and vitamin D and pain management applications and of course, neonatal screening. And mass spec has made some inroads, you see, in the rapid microbiology area. There's been some success there. But it's still kind of a niche-oriented marketplace for LC and particularly for mass spec. We are investing early funds in several areas. We're doing some things on a cooperative basis with some thought leaders in this area that we think will pay off, probably not early on in 2014, but as we look out past 2014 and to the broader area of things that are in classical diagnostics or broader than that in the kind of metabonomics, metabolomics and proteomics area. Looking at biomarkers, looking at early-on indicators of disease, we're seeing broad-scale interest there across many, many thought leaders. And it's blurring the identification of what's truly a diagnostic application versus what's an early-on biomarker application. So I think that's coming, but I think you're going to see the classical R&D and discovery applications certainly being serviced in 2014. Getting into the actual clinic probably comes later on.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And last, in the ultra-high pressure marketplace, I think there's some that try and grab a niche by having lower-pressure formats. Is -- does that really matter in ultra-high pressure, that you can offer a more of a dynamic range? Or is it just a game of getting the most atmospheres?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think what you're probably hearing, Paul, is competitors trying to position themselves against the market leaders. And so if Waters has a particular position that's carved out in the UPC -- UPLC arena and others can't get there, they'll try their best to say, \"It doesn't matter.\" or \"We can do almost as good.\" I think what we find is that customers are looking for the best performance to fit their application, and we don't sell high pressure in and of itself. We sell the -- an instrument that best performs with the chemistries and the software that we bring. So in some applications, you absolutely can get the absolute best performance by utilizing the highest specs of a system, and in other applications, it's the chemistry and the software and service that most bring them into our realm. Art, you want to expand on that?","Arthur G. Caputo","Yes. The reality of the situation is that having been first to come out with a very intensified position in the ultra-performance area, if you look across our product line, we cover the complete gamut of just about everything that anybody's thinking about from all forms of mixing, all forms of pressure, all forms of interfacing. And so from our standpoint, this is all focused on solving specific problems. And most of the competitive positions against us pick 1 or 2 of those areas and try to emphasize it. If you go broadly, our position in the marketplace has not been affected much at all in the last 10 years as we introduced the products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a question on pricing. Can you maybe try and quantify how much pricing contributed to growth in 2013 versus 2012? And as a follow-up, what's baked into your assumptions for guidance this year?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","In a classical sense, pricing's a push, Isaac. We introduce new products, and to the extent that they establish a different price point, that certainly has a mix dynamic, we'd call it. But if you look at the prices of existing products, they're essentially equal across the years.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then for this year, same sort of effect...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","You should anticipate the same dynamic. Margin -- and you can see that in the margin dynamics. The margins are stable x the currency dynamics that we've talked about.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then on the tax rate, just given the unusual cadence there you had last year, could you a little bit -- shed a little bit more color on the cadence this year? You talked about first quarter but maybe for the rest of this year.","Eugene G. Cassis","Yes. We're -- Isaac, we're expecting the tax rate to be between 15% and 16%, and the base of comparison is going to be most dramatic in the first quarter because we started last year off at a rate that included 2 U.S. R&D tax credits. But we're also not sure if we -- we don't discount the possibility of seeing an extension by the U.S. Congress into this year, but we haven't factored that yet into the -- into our assumptions.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","So if tax law stays the same, Isaac, you should see the rates stay stable right across the quarters, unlike last year, when the change in law mandated how we recorded it differently in the first quarter versus the rest of the year.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then just last one, if I could, Doug. Any update from the board on succession planning? And specifically wondering if -- where you guys are in narrowing the field of candidates and whether or not that list includes internal candidates at this point.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, sure. As I think everybody knows, the board has established a successor planning committee that is meeting regularly, has retained an executive search firm. But we're still early on in the process. There's no fast-burning fuse on this, and so I'd say the board is moving in a very confident but measured pace. And I wouldn't expect you to hear anything dramatic on this anytime soon. The board is definitely considering all possible strategic candidates, both internal and external, and it'll probably be the middle of the year before we are prepared to announce any update on this.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, Doug, I wanted to just understand a little bit more about performance in the quarter, to the extent maybe you could characterize how much of a backlog drawdown you had and how much of a pull-forward in sales you had in this quarter versus what you're expecting from the first quarter of '14.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure, Amit. The simple answer is that if you look at our sales growth rate versus our orders growth rate, our orders growth rate was a little bit stronger than our sales growth rate. And backlog dynamics did not materially influence our fourth quarter results. So it's really still an open question as to whether the orders and the underlying strength that we saw in the fourth quarter, how much that portends for the future. And you can make a case that it's a stronger case for the future than we've seen, but as I've said, we're going to be a little cautious in how we approach 2014.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And a follow-up, I guess, on the gross margin side, I was hoping maybe Gene or John could talk a little bit more about the dynamics between the U.K. facility and the volume gains for 2014. Just trying to understand why gross margin won't tick up more. And I guess I have one more for you on China. The big players, GE, Siemens, Philips, have all talked about slowdowns there. Do you look at that in any sort of lag factor as potentially impacting the business later in '14 for you?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","The China question, I think, is a logical one for people to ask. I think, like a lot of areas, the fact that GE faces different dynamics in their infield in the United States or in Western Europe certainly comes as no surprise to you versus us. It's a different business. It has different dynamics behind it. We're in a totally different segment of the marketplace. We think -- and of course, we try to monitor this with how much funding is available and what the underlying requests for new applications are. I'd say, if anything, we see increasing demand in China rather than decreasing demand. And yes, at various times, we see there's a little funkiness with the release of funds, but I'd say we see no current signs or underlying signs of reduced demand across our major served marketplaces in China. And on the other question, Gene, you want to...","Eugene G. Cassis","Yes, on the gross margin front, Isaac, the guidance...","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Amit.","Eugene G. Cassis","Oh, I'm sorry, Amit. I'm sorry, Amit. On the gross margin front, we typically get manufacturing leverage on the instrumentation side. And in prior years, and when we have a typical growth rate in our instrument sales, we'd usually talk about 20 bps' worth of leverage on the manufacturing side. As we begin to look at what we hope is conservative guidance for 2014, we're thinking that, that sort of better absorption of fixed cost will likely be offset by some potential higher cost on the U.K. side, as well as some potential mix dynamic. So it's those factors that are driving our assumption of a flat gross margin. Looking at the effect of foreign currency, if we look at it on the top line, you're likely to see that the stronger euro kind of offsets the little weakness in the yen. And again, as you're looking at gross margins, be cognizant that it's really the yen and the pound that are the most important currencies to look at because we have a disproportionate amount of cost in goods sales that are pound denominated, and we have pretty low costs in Japan that are yen based.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Amit, I think it's important to note that when we talk about the differential cost of our Manchester facility, what our Manchester folks have been residing in for the past 17 years, to call it manufacturing sites that Charles Dickens would have thought was not adequate would be probably being fair. I mean, what they have produced in the kind of facilities that they've lived in has just been amazing, and we finally bit the bullet and have brought them into what we think of as the 21st century. But that's come at a cost, and it'll take us a year to kind of leaven those expenses. So that's why we're careful about describing -- bringing those costs. It'll take a while to grow into.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My first question is looking at the incremental margin of about 30% in Q4, which was on a really strong revenue growth number, this is arguably a little bit lighter than what one might have expected on that type of revenue growth. I think you could say that's even more true given the extra day in the quarter, and that can have, I think, a favorable impact to the margin line, especially if you have a strong instrument performance. So could -- with all that in mind, could you address any concern related to the margin performance as some might argue that this performance could be indicative of you approaching peak margins? And I think this is especially relevant given that your 2014 guidance seems to imply that you're expecting incrementals only in the 20s on mid-single-digit top line growth.","John A. Ornell","The answer to that question is really based on the fact that the overage that we had in the fourth quarter put a fair number of our incentive plans in marginal payout situations from no payout as we made our way through the third quarter. So what you're seeing is an incremented spend in Q4 that's really making up for amounts that would have been accrued across the quarters had we anticipated that we would have reached this type of growth earlier in the year. There's no doubt that Q4 was much stronger than even our internal forecasts, and fortunately, for those in some of these geographies, there is a payout versus nothing. And you're really seeing the impact of all of that, like I said, all in the fourth quarter versus spread across the year. So I think from that perspective, you can understand how that surprise on the top line just translated to a little bit heavier spending down the P&L. On the tax front, another area that took a little bit of the wind out of the balloon as well, again, the overage was more a factor of production in the U.S., better experience with some of the mass specs that were coming out of the higher tax rate jurisdictions, so it moved the tax rate a little bit as well and took away some of the leverage all the way to the bottom line, as you might have expected. And I wouldn't say, really, any of that is indicative of the ability of the business to leverage itself going forward. These are just plans that generally pay out at a mid-single-digit rate. We've got them factored in to the guidance going forward. And I think we're being, hopefully, a bit conservative on the leverage that we're looking at for next year, and I would say if we're lucky enough to do a little bit better than the mid-single digit, you're more likely than not to see that create the type of leverage that you historically have seen from us as that may materialize as the year goes on.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that's really helpful. And I guess, if we use that as a launching point into my follow-up, it seems like the guidance for incrementals, at least embedded into guidance for 2014, are a little bit lower than I would have expected. Again, that may just be a function of trying to be conservative as you head into the new year. But if you look at, again, and this is nothing new, your high capital mix as a percentage of revenue, visibility is clearly inherently challenging for you quarter-to-quarter. It always has been. It does seem like visibility has been a little bit more challenging than normal the last several quarters. I think it'd be useful to maybe just to talk through to the extent that there are some efforts that you guys have made over the last several quarters to improve visibility, if those are progressing and how relevant are those as we think about your outlook heading into 2014 and what looks like a wider range at the EPS lines than, I believe, what we've seen from you for a little while.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure, Doug. I mean, I think visibility in our business isn't -- most of the life science tools people is challenged because we work with such slim backlogs. And for all of us, most of our revenue is produced by orders that are generated in the quarter. So you're really challenged by looking at what you think is going to happen from quarter-to-quarter rather than some of the large industrial players who work with multi-quarters that are -- of sales are in their backlog. And so clearly, as we look at 2013, we went from flat to low 1% kind of growth coming in the first quarter, gradually increasing. We saw 4% kind of growth in the third quarter, and then very strong fourth quarter. So you're talking about -- and clearly, we influence that. We think we're doing better than most. I don't think most people are going to produce 10% organic growth, and the people we've seen so far are about 1\/3 of that. So I do think we're doing better, but it's tough to string that -- what do you string next to that, and say the first quarter's going to be 12% growth? We think that's unlikely. Maybe we saw some end-of-the-year budget flush in some of our customers. We clearly saw a strong response to our new products, so we're encouraged about that. But where we think we're being rational and logical, as we say, the first quarter is probably not as strong as the fourth quarter. Where is it on that continuum? And certainly versus the first quarter of last year, we think it's better. We'll put a couple of quarters behind us, and we'll have greater confidence in how we proceed. But at this point in the year, as we look out a full year, we think where we are is a proper mix between the encouragement that we saw in the fourth quarter and the possibility that we'll see a blip or 2 as we go through this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just one from me, bit of a bigger-picture question for Doug. Doug, when you think about the mass spec field for this year, do you have a view on what technology or workflow area you think the industry might focus on? 2012 seemed to be a bit of a QTof year. Last year, it looks like there was a triple quad focus. Is there anything or anywhere that you think is sort of ripe for attention in 2014?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think outside of the single quad area or the QDa that we're very optimistic about, which is really a chromatographer's platform, I think it's going to be a continuation of the high-end research-grade instruments, Dan. I think the interest in proteomics and metabonomics, this whole area of translational interest in getting molecules, either diagnostic molecules or therapeutic molecules, we're seeing from the cancer centers and from other therapeutic centers a huge amount of interest. And so they're looking for the most powerful technologies they can get, and they're very interested in both the physics of the high end, as well as the software. So I'd say that's the area that I'd look to sustaining high interest.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Doug, just what worries you about the underlying business strength as you go from Q4 to Q1?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I guess I see more silver linings, Peter, than I see looming dark clouds. I think that -- I wish the large integrated pharmaceutical companies had some more strength to them. So in a macroeconomic sense, I don't see a lot of momentum coming out of big pharma, but I see a lot of continuing strength almost everywhere else in the life science arena. So I don't see, certainly, any short-term issues coming out of China, just the opposite. We see more interest coming out of China. So I'd say, India, it's still -- I think we're going to have to wait until later on in the year to see a real bounce in India. It's not likely we're going to see early-on return to growth in India. But we continue to see good conditions in the United States and I think improving conditions in Western Europe. So I think that, overall, is more silver lining than dark cloud.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Just 2 quick ones. Can you tell us what about the TA deals you did and how much that's going to contribute to '14? And also, John, is this your last call?","John A. Ornell","I believe it is.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","John, you can take care of both of those.","John A. Ornell","Yes, it is, but I'm -- and I'm going to let Gene talk about 2014's impact from TA. But yes, it is. Thank you.","Eugene G. Cassis","Derik, I think as you look at TA business and the 2014 outlook, probably companies that we acquired before 2013 are going to have the biggest impact on the top line growth. So these are the assets that we acquired that involve high-temperature DSC, as well as biocalorimetry. The most recent couple of introductions are probably going to contribute less than a point of growth to the TA business this year, but potentially more significantly in 2015. So there is a little bit of a lag. If I think about the growth that TA had in 2013, we probably got a couple of points of growth over the full year from those high-temperature applications and biocalorimetry. But you had a very stable business in rheology and thermal analysis that had a nice growth foundation for that business.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That was a couple of points for TA, Derik, de minimis for the total company.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, correct. Yes. So first of all, I'm just going to say, John, it's been a pleasure working with you the last 13 years. I can't believe it's been that long, but good luck. And then I'll go back to something more mundane on this is -- and I guess, can you quantify -- just given sort of the pickup in pharma, I mean, how much do you think was budget flush related? And I guess it goes to the question of sustainability of the pharma business. You sort of alluded that. I'm just wondering if you could quantify how much flush there could be from pent-up demand, you thought there could be in the quarter.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Derik, I don't -- typically, when we talk about budget flush, we're talking about big pharma. And we're talking about the fact that their capital plans are getting finalized later in the years, and they're cautious early on in the years, and then they find themselves with money to spend at the end. We didn't see that from big pharma. So -- and we don't think that much of what we saw in the fourth quarter was kind of big pharma funding through biotech joint ventures or things like that. So while you always think that you could be seeing an end-of-the-year dynamic, as we look at what actually happened in our fourth quarter, we can't say particularly in our big U.S. accounts that we've seen much of that. So we're cautiously optimistic that this is more sustainable than a onetime event that dramatically influenced the fourth quarter.","All right. Well, thank you, all, for taking the time to be with us. We certainly think we ended the fourth quarter on a high note, and we'll look forward to updating you on our next conference call. Thank you.","John A. Ornell","Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, good  morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call, as usual, is John Ornell, the Waters Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations. ","As our normal practice, I'll start with an overview of the quarter's results, and John will follow with details of our financials and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.","John A.

The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's estimates or views as of the date of this release and should not be relied upon as representing the company's estimates or views as of any date subsequent to the date of this call. ","Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Well obviously, our sales in the first quarter fell short of our expectations as we encountered weaknesses in some developing markets and delays in capital releases from many of our larger pharmaceutical customers. However, as we look at the various pushes and pulls that resulted in the quarter's sales performance, I believe that the underlying demand for our product and services remains intact and that we will see improvements as we go through the rest of the year. ","When you look at the first quarter, our sales were flat organically and our adjusted earnings per share declined 4%. For the Waters division, a geographical situation of the business is useful in understanding the quarter's sales trend. In the quarter, sales growth from the approximately 1\/3 of the business that we derived from the developing regions, including non-Japan Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, did not provide the growth that we've seen in recent quarters. ","Our instrument sales in India declined rather sharply due to the residual budgetary effects of a weaker rupee and deferments in capital spending at both generic drug makers and CROs. At the start of a new fiscal year, as we enter the second quarter and more favorable quarterly comparisons, we're anticipating a return to growth in India and are encouraged by an improving trend that we've begun to see earlier in the second quarter.","In China, sales in the first quarter were up double digits based on strong industrial and governmental spending. Sales growth rates in the Middle East and Eastern Europe were weak in this quarter, and this weakness can be attributed to a tough base of comparison as well as the great amount of political instability in the region.","For Western Europe and North America, delays in the release of capital budgets by larger multinational drug firms resulted in slower sales growth rate. The effect of these delays was most meaningful to our business in the U.S. Spending by smaller specialty and biopharma firms in the U.S. was more in line with our expectations and helped to at least partially offset the weakness in large pharma. ","The combination of government and university shipments declined at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, with moderate academic growth offset by significant reductions in global governmental spending. Direct governmental spending was particularly weak in Europe and Japan. Our expectations for government and university spending were not very high for the first quarter, and we remain conservative on our outlook for the full year.","When you look at a few positive trends in the quarter, our applied markets including food, environment and clinical diagnostics, all grew nicely and in line with our expectations. This growth was based considerably on strong shipments of UPLC, MS\/MS tailored systems and was fairly balanced geographically and indicative of a continuation of an established growth trend in these applications. Sales growth to the more economically sensitive industrial chemicals segment held up well in the quarter for both our Waters and TA instruments division.","Looking more closely at TA instruments, the division started the year off on a positive note with about 10% sales growth. TA has continued to benefit from sales of its new Discovery DSC, TGA and hybrid rheometer instruments and in addition, began to generate new business in high-temperature applications. Geographically, TA saw stronger sales growth in the U.S., Japan and China, all growing at strong double-digit rates.","For instrument sales in the Waters division, highlights in the quarter included continued double-digit sales growth for H-Class ACQUITY UPLC and for our Xevo family of tandem quadrupole based systems, especially our ultrasensitive Xevo TQ-S. As I mentioned earlier today, the strength in tandem quadrupole MS based systems was primarily for applied market opportunities.","Looking at LC instrument systems, the H-Class continues to drive lab upgrade business and a broad array of pharmaceutical opportunities, especially in drug development and quality control. It's notable that H-Class and Xevo TQ-S performed so well given the earlier cited general weakness in large-cap pharmaceutical spending. The decline in instrument sales we saw for the Waters division included the adverse impact of lower Alliance HPLC sales primarily related to the generic drug weakness in India. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew organically at a 7% rate in the quarter.","Looking at new systems offerings in 2012, we are pleased with the positive reception we received from customers at this year's Pittsburgh Conference and more recently in Analytica in Germany. In fact, Waters was recognized with the Editors' Gold Award at Pittcon for our new UPC2 analytical technology platform. UPC2 affords us the opportunity to define a new chromatography business that effectively bridges applications that today are less effectively performed with either gas chromatography or liquid chromatography. We have demonstrated how, for certain analyses, UPC2 can work better, faster and in an environmentally friendlier manner. At Pittcon and at Analytica, we also showcased the family of ACQUITY columns to expand the application range of our UPC2 system.","Other notable introductions at Pittcon included a new version of our NuGenesis informatics platform and a new line of chromatography reagents and standards. These new launches are in response to clearly expressed customer needs to streamline data workflow management and to simplify LC and LC\/MS system calibration and validation.","Before turning you over to John, I want to view our first quarter's performance on a broader context. We currently see factors that will result in better top line growth in the upcoming quarters and feel that the issues that resulted in slower growth at the start of the year are largely temporary. We expect our business momentum in China to continue, while other developing markets exhibit improved growth.","Already, we have begun to see capital budget releases at some of our large accounts and our key product positions remain strong, with new product launch plans in place for later this year. In the meantime, we'll continue to carefully manage our expenses and deploy our strong free cash flow in a conservative manner that you've come to expect from us, share repurchases and smaller acquisitions. ","In all, I'd like to reiterate my belief in our proven business strategy, and we're confident in our ability to accelerate our top and bottom line growth as we move through 2012.","Now here's John with some further details on our financials.","John A. Ornell","Okay. Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. First quarter sales decreased by 2%, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were down 4% at $1 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.04 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.98 this quarter versus $1.01 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning. Reviewing Q1 sales results in comparison to Q1 last year, before foreign currency translation, sales were flat with prior year's first quarter. Translation reduced sales by 2%. Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 2%, Europe sales were flat, Japan was down 3% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 5%.","On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales decreased by 9%, and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter. Within our TA instruments division, sales increased by 10% versus prior year.","Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in as expected at 60.2% comparable to Q1 last year. SG&A expenses were flat this quarter, and R&D expenses increased by 5%.","Our effective operating income tax rate came in as anticipated at about 16%. Net interest expense was $5.7 million, and share count came in at 90.3 million shares, 3 million shares lower than Q1 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.","On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,353,000,000, and debt totaled $1,024,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of $329 million. As for share repurchases, we bought 695,000 shares of our common stock or $62 million this quarter. This leaves $124 million remaining on the current authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less the capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting, excluding unusual non-recurring items. For Q1, free cash flow came in at $100 million after funding $16 million of CapEx and adding back $6 million of non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation. ","Accounts receivable day sales outstanding stood at 76 days this quarter, up 2 days from Q1 last year. And inventories increased by $20 million this quarter, as is typical for the first quarter of the year.","Overall, we had a slow start for 2012, but we do not see Q1 as being indicative of our full year performance. As we now think about the remainder of 2012, we expect to see improvements in the majority of our markets around the world and better momentum in large pharma accounts as capital budgets continue to be released. Just to the prior guidance, we do expect to see continued pockets of weakness in our government and academic segment as the year plays out given the budgetary pressures many countries are facing, particularly in Western Europe. ","For the remaining quarters of the year then, we continue to believe that the improvements that I just mentioned, coupled with a more favorable quarterly base and comparison, will provide for 5% to 7% quarterly growth before currency effects for these next 3 quarters. For the full year, this could result in sales growth, pre-currency, of 4% to 6%. Currency at today's levels is expected to reduce full year sales growth by 2%. Full year reported sales growth would then be between 2% and 4%.","Moving down the P&L. Gross margins are expected to be flat with 2011 at about 60.5%. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate less than sales growth as we continue to manage our operating expenses judiciously. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 16%.","Our fully diluted average share count is likely to be around 89.5 million shares outstanding. And when rolling all of this together, we currently expect 2012 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in a range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share.","As we think about our expectations for the second quarter of 2012, we expect organic sales growth of about 5% to 7%. Currency translation at today's rates will reduce sales by 2%, resulting in reported sales growth of about 3% to 5%. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. ","Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. I think at this point, we can open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Doug, I guess I'll start with a question around the pharma spending, because that seems to be the biggest surprise this quarter. I think India was somewhat expected. But what was the reason behind the pullback by these large pharma customers? And did it come as a surprise to you pretty much late in the quarter? Or were there leading indicators that you sort of looked at that pointed to some kind of weakness in the quarter? And then what are you looking at on a forward-looking basis?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think it's fair to say it was somewhat surprising to us in the same way maybe that the fourth quarter was a little stronger than we originally expected. The out of the chute momentum that we thought would improve as we went through the quarter didn't materialize in the first quarter. Now we've clearly, at this point, autopsied a lot of the particular regions, a lot of the large accounts. We believe we've got good reason to believe that this is a delay and not a permanent delay, and we've got some pretty good evidence of orders moving through the pipeline earlier on in the second quarter. So we've -- it's fair to say that in prior years, at times we've seen delays in capital at big pharma. This was a more significant delay than we've typically seen in the year. But I should say that it's probably split kind of evenly from the big pharma dynamic and the developing market. It's true that we didn't expect India to go gangbusters out of the chute as we weighted the beginning of the fiscal year, but it was a much steeper slowdown in India than we expected.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on the reasons behind the pharma weakness. Could there be a competitive dynamic going on there? I just wanted to clarify that.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think it's always dangerous to look at significant share dynamics on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Clearly we've done that. You could have said, \"Well, gee, they gained share in the fourth quarter, and something happened in the first quarter.\" We don't think that's happening. You always have some competitive losses and some competitive wins. We think that this is a market dynamic and not a competitive dynamic. We'll continue to monitor that, but we haven't seen any product introductions or customer losses that work against us. So it's fair to keep our eyes open on that, Nandita, but I can't say that we're seen much evidence of it at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just 2 quick ones for me, Doug. I guess first, I know you typically don't talk in terms of orders, but one of your peers, actually just the other day, mentioned very similar dynamics to what you talked about in terms of end markets on the mass spec side. And then just -- but they mentioned that throughout the quarter, orders kind of continually improved. So can you maybe just talk about your order growth rates, in particular in maybe countries like India and some of the weaker areas? And the second is kind of a follow-up maybe for John. If you think about your guidance, can you maybe split your consumable outlook versus your instrument outlook? It seems like consumables were fairly strong this quarter. It was obviously offset by pretty weak instruments.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure, Jon. I think there's a good reason for being careful about orders rate dynamics, because orders don't have the same dynamic that sales do and orders can be canceled, and order patterns can differ dramatically from sales pattern. I do think it is a qualitative measure that can be useful, and I think it is fair to share that our order rate growth was better than our sales dynamic this quarter. So I mean that's a fact that I think is a fair one to share. And the first quarter of last year, you'll recall we had some large mass spec shipments that came out of backlog, so that had an impact on us. But it's also fair to say that our orders came in softer than we expected, and I think the dynamic of the slow release in big pharma is a fair one to keep in mind. We think that'll begin to catch up, and we'll continue to monitor that closely. The second part of your...","John A. Ornell","The second was just a question on splitting out the guidance between recurring revenues and instrumentation. And on that one, Jon, we're pretty confident that our recurring revenues will retain about that 7% rate you saw in the first quarter. And then instruments are likely to be the variable that, for the next 3 quarters, would bring us down to the lower end of the range, which is 5%. So instruments by themselves could be 4% to 6%, something in that range, with recurring getting closer to 7% for the next 3 quarters is what's incorporated in our guidance.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So John, do you think -- the reason I was asking, do you think the extra day had much of an impact on the consumable or the recurring revenues in the first quarter?","John A. Ornell","No, I don't. I think that, de minimis, it wouldn't even have been 1%. So I think the 7% growth is -- there was a little bit of a base comparison on the chemistry side. Service was very strong. We're pretty confident we're going to see above that rate as we go across the next 3 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","A quick question on your emerging market commentary, your developing market commentary. How sensitive do you think your business would be in China due to the lower-than-expected GDP growth over there?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Dan, it's a fair question. I think most of the attention is on bigger projects, infrastructure projects. I think as we continue to probe this matter and look at laboratory spending and life science spending, it's not likely to be the first target or a major target of budgetary slowdowns in China. Now of course, if a major reduction happens, it probably drops all boats a little bit, but we're not seeing it at this point.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up, can you give us an update on the attached rate on your UPLC instruments?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. You want to -- in terms of the chemistry?","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","ACQUITY chemistry that goes along with...","John A. Ornell","Yes. It appears to be in about the 80% range at this time. It was higher in the beginning as we introduced the H-Class. That particular technology, unlike the original introduction, enables the customer to utilize conventional LC columns which, in fact, can be a broader base of manufacturers' columns. But in terms of UPLC utilization, the column attach rate for UPLC columns specifically remains very high because of their performance.","Operator","The next question comes from Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just on the large pharma customers, just, Doug and John, what are you hearing from these customers that -- why they discussed the slow release this year? Is it the uncertain economy? Is there anything new on just kind of R&D? Is there -- just kind of wondering for maybe some color, if you can provide it, about what gives you confidence that the slow release is going to open up.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Boy, it's a fairly broad-based dynamic. So I mean it's one of the things that makes us believe that it's not really a competitive dynamic. It's both Western Europe and the United States. They're pretty much across the board. Particularly, as we've gone back more deeply into these accounts as we've started into the second quarter, it's telling how emphatic most of these accounts are about their intention to buy during the rest of the year. I mean, that's why as we've probed, did we lose big orders? Did somebody else penetrate into these accounts? We can't find that dynamic. We can find a lot of complaining about delays in laboratories being able to get their request through their systems and their continuing desire to buy our products. So that part is confident, but the part that's sometimes difficult to call is when will it release. That's why we think we have seen some kind of a leakage coming in that release process, but it's way too early to declare victory that this just was a one-quarter dynamic. We'll continue to monitor this pretty closely.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, sort of related to that. So it sounds like the customers themselves aren't indicating that kind of budgets are going to come in below original expectations. They're kind of maintaining their overall budget outlook, but expecting it to tick up. And then maybe related to that, what are you -- what were you basing your pharma end market? Or what were you assuming for the pharma end market to grow at this year for Waters prior to today? And what do you think it grows at now for 2012?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Mid-single digits.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And in terms of the budgets, have they indicated that actually budgets will decline from original [indiscernible]?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think what we have seen indicated -- now this isn't an algebraic formula that you can point to. But we continue to believe that's consistent with what big pharma is intending. That's certainly what the people down the ladder in pharmaceutical QC and development labs believe. Now sometimes, they're out of step with what their top management, but so far, our triangulation suggests that that's still a reasonable outlook for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Knight with CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","In the other parts of Asia such as China, particularly Japan, could you talk about the -- do you see any recovery from the tsunami in that marketplace?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I would say what we -- Japan's, with a few exceptions, has been a kind of stable, very low-growth territory for a number of years now. I think -- and this quarter, we had a particularly tough comparison largely because of some backlog dynamics in Japan last year. I'd say we're still seeing kind of the same basic level of momentum. Maybe a little bit of infrastructure spend in Japan has kind of gone away from the life science laboratory towards basic infrastructure rebuild. We hear stories like that that's largely -- no, you can't point to government statistics so much, but I believe some of that's gone on in the last 6 months or so. So if that's true, I think we'll begin to see a little bit of performance improvement coming out of Japan as we go forward.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then what color or what should we be watching regarding the currencies, the franc, the yen, the dollar relationship? Any hedging or actions you've taken to reduce that volatility or risk this year?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","No. I mean, traditionally, for a lot of reasons that we've talked about in the past, the notion of hedging forward your currency sales risk just doesn't particularly work in this industry. The yen has weakened a little bit against the dollar in the past 3 to 4 months; was in the high 70s, now it's in the low 80s, seems to be stable around that low 80s level. And the euro has been -- it got as low as the mid 1.20s. It's now in the low 1.30s. It bounces around there a little bit. That's the level that we're anticipating for the rest of the year. That's as good a forecast, I suppose, as you can make at this point, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from Quintin Lai of Robert W. Baird.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So Doug, on the call, you mentioned that the H-Class and Xevo did well. So as you kind of parse through the Q1 results, I mean, was some of the budgetary issues with big pharma more on the -- for lack of a better word, more routine? Or are the older instruments in an upgrade cycle just kind of delayed out?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, there are 2 things I'd say, Quintin. The earlier stage parts of R&D suffered the most. So that's discovery and the higher end mass specs, and then the Alliance aligned particularly with generics were the 2 major dynamics that we see in the pharma world.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then with respect to India, Doug, is there -- are you really looking at that region about maybe how you go to market there and maybe pricing more of your instruments in local currency to take out some of the volatility in demand?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Frankly, no, Quintin. I think we don't see any real competitive dynamic here that's changing the thrust. I think almost everything going on in India is related to internal struggles and the rupee, but we're not going to price in India really differently than we prize anywhere else. The end market pricing in India is about the same as we're seeing everywhere else in our international world, and we don't think that pricing is going to dramatically change our end market performance. This is something we got to work through. We have an excellent position. We have very high market share in India. We got to get through the local dynamics on the regulatory burdens and the CRO and then new product this year, the new product development issues that they're experiencing in India. We think we see some of that coming. I think it's probably going to take into the second half of the year before we see any kind of return to normalcy in India.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMC.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A number of my questions have been answered, but maybe just one starting off on kind of your cost structure. I mean, you've always talked about your ability to pull levers if needed. At this stage in the year, I mean, do you have any updated thoughts on cost structure heading into the rest of the year in light of this first quarter coming in a bit below expectations?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'll let John embroider a little bit here, but I mean you can see that our SG&A spending was flat in the quarter. We didn't dramatically adopt any plans to restructure our results because at this point, we don't think that we're seeing a long-term significant reduction in demand. We'll continue to monitor that, Tycho, and if we change that belief, we'll have to look at our cost structures. But I think you can tell that within the relevant range, we haven't exploded our cost structure. And as a result, if we're right about a return to normal levels of demand, then we'll be able to leverage that uptick in demand to pretty good earnings results.","John A. Ornell","We also typically back-end load investment spending in new headcount and the like and obviously, we didn't do much of any of that in the first quarter and we're going to lag that out a bit too in the second quarter until we're comfortable that we're on track. So we kind of naturally in our budget cycle have that kind of capability to keep at bay those investments until we're comfortable that it's time to spend.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then maybe a question on Europe. I mean, I think you said that that was flat. One of your peers that had reported on mass spec numbers had talked about that being particularly soft. Can you just talk about your visibility into Europe and in light of the broader pharma commentary you provided, but also how you think about Europe over the next couple of quarters?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I'd say Europe and U.S. were -- overall, had similar dynamics. It was similar disappointment in the output of the large pharma. I mean, Europe is probably a little bit more weighted to large pharma, and we clearly -- we anticipated soft governmental spending. We certainly saw that. I guess the -- and we've certainly seen the weakest conditions in Southern Europe, which had the most macroeconomic issues. And I guess other than that, I don't think that there's anything -- I'd say the weakness in the government academic segment affects the high-end mass spec and we certainly saw that, because that's -- much of that is government-funded initiatives. So I'd say we are not anticipating that to change too much. We do think the pharma segment should improve as we go through the year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then maybe just last one on pharma again. You -- I think you talked about it, an assumption for mid-single-digit growth there, and we're just trying to kind of understand what's behind that. I mean, if you kind of look at the aggregate pharma R&D budgets, they're flat to probably down over the next couple of years. So what gives you conviction that you can kind of -- that you can outgrow that market? Is it share shift? Is it new product cycles? Is it kind of continued conversion of ACQUITY?","John A. Ornell","Yes. When we look at our pharma business, Tycho, it's about 60% of our business, broadly defined. The large pharma portion of it is about -- well, it's under 10% this quarter, but it's typically 11%, 12%, and that group typically lags the overall segment that we talked about growing mid single digit. So the expectation for large pharma within that overall segment is a few points less or more than the average. So it's a low single-digit growth expectation for these top accounts. I mean, they were down double digit in the first quarter, causing the issue that we're looking at, and we're confident that that's not going to continue at that rate for the remainder of the year. But it's really the generics. It's the Biotech. It's the CROs that grow more quickly than the average that we think will come back and provide an overall growth that's mid-single digit. It won't be large pharma that's going to drive us to that mid-single-digit rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Clearly, you've talked a bit about what makes you feel better about the outlook moving forward. You've also mentioned, in response to a few earlier questions, that Q4 was a bit stronger than you expected and clearly, Q1 was a bit weaker. So taking this a step further, if we continue to look backwards, are there signs that maybe Q4 may have benefited a bit at the expense of Q1? And related to that, if we go back and look at your pharma growth for last year by quarter, I think sequentially, you did 20% year-over-year, 13%, 10% and 6% or something in that ballpark. Clearly, most of those figures are well above the historical norms. So you did talk a lot about delays in pharma capital budget releases, but is there a chance you guys were just overly aggressive in your internal forecast relative to what is a pretty difficult comp?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Go ahead, John.","John A. Ornell","Yes. I think as we look at the quarters of the year, there's no doubt that we have historically seen a fair amount of seasonality, and we have historically pointed out that Q1 and Q4 are always the most difficult quarters to forecast. In the fourth quarter you've got the capital spend, an elusive mentality where you're waiting for the big push at the end of the year for people to spend their CapEx budgets. And then at the start of the year, they have to re-up that capital budget. And some of them get released early in the year. Some of them get released into the second quarter. So the first quarter and the fourth quarter for us was -- particularly with large pharma, was always a little bit difficult to forecast. And we -- I don't necessarily look at this and say that there was a trend developing across last year for which Q1 is a point on any line. I see it as a point off the line. It's -- it is true that in Q1 last year, we came out of the gate very strong. There was spending very early on from a lot of pharmaceutical accounts. I think they felt better about the business or better about the business environment just generally. So the basic comparison was difficult. We thought we had that accommodated in a lower expectation for the first quarter than for the full year, but we did not foresee a significant number of large pharma accounts really spending almost nothing on capital to start the year, which is where Q1 landed.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. I guess on the other topic du jour, India, this is -- this rupee devaluation issue is now a multi-quarter phenomena. Given that plans for purchases accordingly have, in some cases, been delayed for a few quarters, is it fair to conclude that there is a bolus of demand that should be worked through in early Q2 with the budgets being reset? And are you seeing this already?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We believe that. We think we see some sign of that, Doug, but it's -- I'm going to be very careful, because I thought we'd see a little of that in the first quarter, and we didn't. If anything, we didn't. Now you've got multiple issues facing the Indians, including some relatively newly arising regulatory issues with their ability to export into the U.S. That may be making them a bit more conservative in how they look at near-term spending too. We think that's not going to change the ultimate view of India and the likelihood that the investments have to be made in order to keep up with the generic drug demand, but it might take a little bit longer than I'd otherwise like.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I could sneak in one last operational question. As you noted, SG&A, I believe, was flat year-over-year. Is this largely just a function of the weaker-than-expected instrument contribution in the quarter? And if so, how much higher would this have been if you had hit your guidance? And is this the right -- what's the right way to think about this moving forward?","John A. Ornell","Yes. I'd say that the biggest reason why Q1 was flat was because of lower sales associated with less commission, less cost on that front. We've talked about SG&A growing 1 point or 2 less than sales growth. I would say that we look like we're on track to continue to be able to assume that. But I would say that -- I mean, there are natural variable spend in the business that ratchets up and down with the sales line and largely, that's what you saw in the first quarter.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","If I -- as John has said before, we were careful coming into the year. We typically are, maybe we're even a little bit more careful in spending on headcount. So we were -- we're not adding heads anticipating that we would see how this year began to spend itself out. And I -- we're prudent in that, and we'll continue to be prudent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Doug, I'm just trying to wrestle with the inherent uncertainty in budgets with your commentary that you are seeing evidence of the orders moving through, the ones that obviously didn't come through in the first quarter. Can you expand on this comment that you have evidence that orders are pulling through? Talk a little bit about the size of those orders. And do they make up for the miss in the first quarter?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I mean, I should say that what we are seeing is both the placement of some orders and the -- perhaps more confidence on the part of the customers that we're dealing with that those orders are progressing down their internal cycle at a more pronounced pace. So I wouldn't say it's all related to actually hard copy orders that we have in hand, but a lot of these customers had told us that they were placing orders in February and March, of course. I mean, we -- it was just not a dream that we had that this business was coming. They fully expected to get their budgets cleared. They fully expected to place them. And in many cases they'd say, \"The order's in purchasing. I can't get it out of purchasing.\" Now those things are beginning to move in a faster clip down that process, particularly in a number of these large pharmas that we have good relationships with. So I'd say we -- clearly, some of those large orders that we were tracking and expected to get in the first quarter have now started rolling in on the second quarter, and that evidence makes us feel better.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","From a size perspective though, like, enough to offset what happened in the first quarter? Or can you maybe just have that?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think it's just fair to say it's early on in the quarter. Three weeks does not a quarter make. It's a good sign, but it certainly is no way to say that we've got the quarter in hand. So it's a good fact, and it's a positive fact that we didn't have 1.5 months, 2 months ago. So that's all I'm willing to say. It's no guarantee, but it's a good fact.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up is just on the trend of R&D rationalization. You've talked about that in the past as something that has been ongoing. How are you viewing pharma companies rationalizing R&D spending going forward? What's your underlying assumption of how that impacts this end market?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think it's been a continuing trend for a lot of years. I don't think that what we're seeing in the early part of this year is a dramatic change from kind of what we saw in 2011. You're continuing to see more emphasis on outsourcing, continuing to see these companies work with -- moving clinical trials into areas like India and Eastern Europe. And you're continuing to see a shift in influence from small molecule drugs to biopharmaceuticals, and we think that that shift to biopharmaceuticals is richer in our kinds of technology than small molecular weight dynamic. So we don't see that changing. You can't find a big pharma that doesn't lead any of these discussions with the fact that in the near term, most of their influence is on biopharmaceuticals.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can you offer any context on the acquisition contribution? I know you did 2 small deals; 1 late last year, 1 early this year. What does that contribute to the first quarter as well as the year in terms of sales?","John A. Ornell","Yes. It was -- it rounded to nothing. It was a few points of the TA growth. So there was -- TA, we said, grew at 10% with -- before currency. It would have been about 7% without the acquisition, but it's de minimis on a full company basis.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So less than 50 basis points for the year?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Less than 50.","John A. Ornell","For the quarter.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","And the year.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. What about the year?","John A. Ornell","And for the year, too. For the year, yes.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I mean, we continue to look at doing other things of this nature, but it's hard to imagine that it would be getting much more significant than that for the year.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then can you offer, Doug, just an updated view geographically for 2012, U.S., Europe and then Japan and Asia, outside Japan? Just give us where your guidance is now set kind of from a geographic perspective.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Let's see. Yes. John maybe...","John A. Ornell","Yes. I could get that. For the rest of the year, we're looking at a growth that's 5% to 7%. We're looking for the developing areas of the world to improve and to be kind of at the higher end of that, kind of a high single-digit expectation for the developing world. So that would include China, that would include Latin America, Eastern Europe to grow in the low single digits, being dragged down throughout the year through issues and pressures on the government side of business there. We're looking for the U.S. to be about a mid single-digit growth rate for the remainder of the year and Japan kind of a low to mid, depending on basic comparison.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then it's safe to say that the disappointment here is pharma related, right? So if you look at your applied industrial, and I guess I would include chemical, has anything changed in your view on that set of end markets for the year?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'd say we -- you heard us talk about our belief that pharma's going to improve. So I think we've talked enough about that. The industrial chemical and the applied markets have performed well, and we expect those to continue to perform well. So I think certainly on the industrial side, both Waters and TA have broad evidence that, that should continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The first question I wanted to ask, I just -- you spent a lot of time talking about the macro end market drivers of the quarter miss there. And I wanted to maybe isolate and be just specific about asking about any large orders from specific customers within pharma that might have caused disruption. Was there -- is it fair to say that it wasn't isolated to any handful of large orders?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That's correct, Isaac.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just secondly, if I look at sort of the components of the growth this quarter, you had organic growth. You had growth in the consumable side of I think 7%, and then I think you said the instrumentation side was down about 9%. As you look at the orders growing a little faster than sales this quarter, is it fair to say that we'll see a reversion to the mean, so to speak, between those 2 components of the business?","John A. Ornell","That's the expectation, yes.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. And thank you, all, for being with us.

Sir, you may begin.","John Lynch - Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations","Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone and welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the third quarter and full year 2016.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Lastly, as you recall in January of this year, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments Division. So, on this call and into the future, we will continue to refer to Waters products and markets and TA Instruments products and markets.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A session is Gene Cassis, Chief Financial Officer. As with past earnings calls I will provide an overview of our second quarter results as well as some broader commentary.","I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results exceeded our expectations with revenue growth of 8% against a strong base of comparison, and earnings per share growth of 15% at constant currency or 20% growth as reported. Revenue performance was broad-based across end markets, product lines and geographies, with our key business drivers continuing to provide reliable growth.","Our strong earnings performance resulted from a combination of a robust top line, positive mix dynamics, and disciplined expense management while continuing to invest in R&D and our growth initiatives.","Taking a closer look at our major end markets, our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters products once again led the way with 12% growth in the quarter. We saw solid growth in our core small molecule QA\/QC workflows, as well as in large molecule R&D oriented applications.","Year-to-date, the pharmaceutical market has grown 11% for us, on top of a double-digit growth rate in the first half of 2015. Though our growth in the pharmaceutical market continues to be primarily driven by smaller and specialty firms, our largest global customers also increased their business with us in the quarter at a mid-single-digit rate.","Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical end markets, grew 7% in the quarter, and represented a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter. Highlights in the industrial sector included double-digit growth in our TA product category, as well as solid growth in Waters products sold to food markets.","Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 4% decline in the second quarter, which was primarily affected by significant weakness in Japan.","Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, Waters instrument sales grew 7%, with positive demand for core LC and bench-top LC\/MS platforms. We are seeing significant traction for our recently introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued strength in our other core LC offerings. These are workhorse systems that are heavily used in regulated pharmaceutical testing methods and are typically deployed in laboratories that have standardized on our industry leading Empower CDS software. We continue to champion the use of mass spectrometry detection for LC workflows and as part of this we see broader and deeper adoption of our ACQUITY QDa mass detector.","On the research mass spec side, interest for our newest bench-top systems, including the Xevo QTof G2-XS for biologic workflows and our newly launched Xevo TQ-XS for demanding quantification applications, is increasing as we move into the second half of the year.","Waters' total recurring revenue, the combination of service and consumables, grew at 10% in Q2. Our service and support business grew at a 9% rate, with balanced performance geographically associated with increased demand for service plans. Consumables sales were up 11%, with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC columns, protein separation columns and Oasis PRiME sample preparation cartridges.","Our GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling kits continue to revolutionize the characterization of glycans for biopharma development and quality testing applications. The speed and simplicity of this new analytical workflow and proprietary chemistry kit is helping to bring new protein-based therapies to market more quickly and at the same time presents Waters with future business opportunities for bio QC system sales.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the strength and the stability of our recurring revenue lines as an indication of the depth of Waters's support among high-utilization customers, as well as the financial benefits of these attractive components of our business profile.","Turning to our TA Instruments products, this business was yet another highlight of the quarter, with 10% growth performance. As you may recall, TA launched a new thermal product line called the Discovery Series in the first quarter. While the timing of this launch may have had the effect of delaying new system orders in the first quarter, shipments of the new Discovery DSC benefited TA's growth in the second quarter. The new Discovery TGA system, which is often ordered along with the DSC, will begin to ship this quarter. These new products are being well-received by the market.","Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, we generally saw healthy trends around the globe. North American sales grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, European sales grew at a low double-digit rate and Asian sales grew a high single-digit rate. Growth in the United States was highlighted by continued strong pharmaceutical demand, partially offset by lower governmental and academic spending. The second half of 2016 should benefit from a combination of new product launches, including our Xevo TQ-XS, our Vion IMS QTof and a new line of CORTECS Columns, as well as expected higher spending by governmental agencies in the coming months.","In Europe, we also saw strong pharmaceutical trends, while overall growth was augmented by better demand for service and mass spectrometry technology. In Western Europe, our business momentum continued smoothly despite the news surrounding the Brexit vote. At this point, it's premature to assess the longer-term effects of the UK's exit from the EU, and therefore our focus continues to be on our customer base and our business operations in the region.","Asia continues to be an area of geographical strength for Waters, highlighted by strong double-digit growth rates in China. And this is off an impressive prior year's performance. Our business in China benefited from strong pharmaceutical sector sales, good balance across end markets and strengthening recurring revenue sales. Our Waters business in Japan grew modestly in the quarter, with strong pharmaceutical sales offsetting a meaningful decline in governmentally funded research spending due to a recent shift of public money towards earthquake disaster relief.","In total, our first half of 2016 was strong, with revenues and profits trending ahead of our initial expectations. Business trends in the broadly defined biopharmaceutical customer base, our core business, suggest a continuation of stability from this end market in the second half of the year.","We have also effectively managed our spending year to date and created operating leverage that can be better seen with neutral currency dynamics, all while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our growth.","At the same time, we are investing time as a management team to think about the future and how we build on our success in our core business, as well as create new vectors of growth. As I've commented on before, we've embarked on a strategy development process that's providing a framework for ongoing business analysis and long-range planning. In this process, we are aiming to clearly articulate the unique strengths of Waters that have enabled us to generate superior long-term returns to build on these strengths and to ensure that we apply our differentiated skills to compelling new growth opportunities. I look forward to updating you on more specifics in 2017.","Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I would simply like to comment how pleased I am with how the Waters team has performed since I began last September. Our leadership team as well as all of our employees throughout the world are focused and are executing. Personally, I continue to emphasize customer and employee engagement as I gain ever-increasing comfort with our unique business model and growth opportunities. The relationships I've established with key customers, my Waters colleagues and our board of directors have been very supportive and energizing. I am excited about our days ahead.","Now I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the second quarter our revenues came in at $537 million, an increase of about 8.5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was neutral. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter were up 20% to $1.58 in comparison to earnings of $1.32 last year. On a GAAP basis our earnings were $1.57 as compared to $1.27 for the second quarter of last year.","The impact of foreign exchange increased second quarter earnings by about $0.06 and without this positive effect our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share would have grown by about 15%.","On the product front, Waters sales were up 8% while TA sales were up 10%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS Instrument platform sales increased by 7% and TA's Instrumentation sales grew by 11% in the second quarter. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 10% with TA service revenue up 9%.","Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 5%, Europe was up 12%, Japan up 3% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 10%. Sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China and in Europe. TA product sales showed broad-based strength in the U.S., Japan and in Europe.","Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.9% versus 57.8% in the second quarter of last year. Year-to-date gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first half of 2015.","Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 10% in the quarter on a constant currency basis and were up about 7% on a reported basis, this primarily due to a weaker British pound.","On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14%. In the quarter net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 81.5 million shares or approximately 1.9 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Turning now to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.6 billion and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $843 million. As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 565,000 shares of our common stock for $77 million. This leaves $275 million on our authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.","In the second quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $25 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investments associated with facilities expansion.","Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter, inventory levels about flat in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.","Now I'd like to discuss our full-year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes the continued growth in biopharmaceutical end-markets, strong recurring revenue growth and relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines. We feel these dynamics support a 6% to 7% constant currency sales increase for the full year 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales, again looking at the full-year.","Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 and come in at around 59%. We expect to manage our operating cash expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth.","Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $27 million. We expect our full-year operating tax rate to come in at around 14%.","Looking at share buybacks, we plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 and at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of around 81 million shares outstanding.","Now rolling all this together, and again on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are now anticipated to be within a range of $6.45 to $6.60. Looking at the third quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a constant currency rate of around 6%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add about a half of a percentage point to sales growth in the third quarter. Rolling all these factors together, we anticipate our adjusted third quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in a range of $1.52 to $1.62.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Chris.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Great. Thank you, Gene. And with that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions please contact our investor relations team after the call. And after the Q&A, I will add a few closing comments.","Liz, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Speakers, our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. Sorry about that. I had the mute on. Hey, congratulations on the quarter, very strong. Hey, just could you talk a little bit more about what you were seeing in the Japanese markets and some of the delays, I mean did that happen relatively late in the quarter, just curious on the dynamics in terms of some of the funding shifts?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure, Derik, maybe I'll just provide a little introduction and then Gene can comment more. It's really a tale of two cities in Japan right now, the core pharma business as we commented has been pretty steady and it was pretty strong, but as we alluded to, there have been some domestic priorities within the Japanese government. And what we hope to believe is a temporary shift of government funding dollars, and therefore we saw a pretty significant fall off in our government business, which really had the effect of offsetting what was about flat growth around the rest of the world in that sector, but obviously brought Japan down to kind of the low single digits as we said. Gene, any more on that?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, the only thing that I would add to what Chris mentioned is that our TA Instruments group had a strong showing in Japan in the quarter, indicating that there is a hunger for new products there as well as funds to invest for new technology, and this is on the industrial side.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And sticking with Japan for just a follow-up, could you remind us on your overall sales exposure there? And just sort of how the strengthening of the yen sort of will impact you?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Well, the business in Japan has been around 8% of our overall revenues. And as you look at currency translation rates between last year and this year, we've seen 10% plus appreciation in the yen. And frankly, we have a very efficient operation there. So, we \u2013 our yen-based expenses are well under control. And so, when you see this kind of fluctuation in the value of the yen moving in the positive direction, there's a significantly positive flow through to our operating income line.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","All right. Thank you, Derik.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is open.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Would you mind talking a little bit about what the government-academic market looked like in the U.S. more specifically, maybe just drill down on that a little bit?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure. Government and academic market in the U.S. was a little bit weak, I would \u2013 not nearly as weak as the Japanese market, I'd call it a slight decline and that was actually a little bit stronger than in the first quarter. As we commented, Tim, last quarter in our conference call we've really been looking to the second half of the year for the government and academic markets to be more robust and at this point in time, we hold with that assumption.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks a bunch. Chris, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the differences you saw in the growth rates within pharma between R&D labs versus QA, just trying to get a sense of what's driving the most upside in that customer group?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure. Happy to address that, Isaac. The growth in pharma was pretty broad based and broad based in a few dimensions. First of all, when I look at it, I'm looking at small molecule, large molecule, bioanalysis. Those type of product segments if you will, we saw pretty reasonable growth. We saw a good balance geographically. We mentioned China, Japan, but obviously the U.S. and particularly Europe, which happens to be a pharma heavy market, was solid.","Our workhorse products are as you know, utilized mostly in late stage development and in routine testing applications and methods in the QC phase and that's really seen by the strength of the recurring revenues, particularly the consumables obviously and also the service piece, and so from the standpoint of QA versus R&D I would say, we remained consistently solid in the QA area and that's been a strong line for some time and it feels to me like we're probably doing better in R&D. And a lot of that has to do with broad trends in the marketplace that we see in terms of the increasing diversity of the types of molecules that are in the pipeline, more utilization of mass spec detection in some of those development efforts, which, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we hope flow through to bio QC type of workflows. So we're really trying to get as granular as we possibly can to understand all the different segments of the pharma market and make sure that we're positioned well in all of them.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. And maybe just a longer-term question. You've been at the helm here coming up on a year pretty soon, and I think in the last couple of months you've started to talk a little bit more about ways to leverage the Waters portfolio into the rise in biologics and the whole concept that you could maybe help play a role in the QA process for that category of drugs. And curious if you have an updated view on how to do that. It's obviously a little bit of a straightforward situation with HPLC in small molecule, but I'm wondering if you have an updated view on how to monetize your technology in the large molecule arena? Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. It's a good question, Isaac, and it's really a pretty core question as we look at our long-range planning, and maybe I'll stop short of saying too much because our \u2013 we're really right in the middle of lot of that work. But we are indeed, in our long-range planning, trying to break down some of these segments and ask the question what does it take to compete and what does it take to win in terms of the adoption of our technology in small molecule versus large molecule. And clearly, as you allude to, the biologics world is innovating at a pretty feverish pace, and some of our technologies, particularly some of our new integrated LC\/MS workflows, appear to have some good traction and provide a nice opportunity to build a nice franchise in that area. And so obviously that's right in the heart of our core business, and it's going to be a strategic priority.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMC. Sir, your line is open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Chris, I'm wondering if you can elaborate on your comment that demand on the pharma side from large customers picked up this quarter? Obviously, you've done really well with smaller and specialty firms, but you did seem to go out of your way to emphasize growth in the large side.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. No. Tycho, I guess what I was saying there is, as you know in previous quarters, at least the three prior quarters that I reported here, we saw probably a more stark difference between the smaller and specialty firms versus the traditional large customers, and I think we've always thought that's actually a strength, because it's a broadening portfolio of customers. We're not really reliant on the traditional large multinational type of big account customers as we may have been five or 10 years ago, and that's been a strength.","That said, other sectors have been stronger than the top customers. But we have seen in recent months and in the quarter, the bigger customers really come back a little bit and get more into that mid-single-digit growth range that I saw. So we were actually very pleased to see that, and I think that reflects trends that I see as I go out into the market and talk with customers, and as you know I'm out and about a lot, and particularly as you get into some of the larger traditional pharma companies, what I see is greater diversities within their own portfolios, chemical entities as well as biologic entities. And so I think that's what's driving it.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, on the industrial side, you had a nice pickup there, how much of that was a function of just new product cadence as you highlighted from TA versus end market demand there picking up a bit?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, TA has been pretty solid and really had a good quarter, and I think that's very much a reflection of I'd say two things. First of all is the new products, the DSC and then, beginning to the market to TGA, even though that hasn't launched yet. We also had an easier comparison in Q2 versus Q1 in TA Instruments, but TA has been a very solid franchise for us, and while it can be a little bit lumpy from time to time as a reflection of those types of end markets, over time, TA has provided very consistent growth and profitability and returns for the company. And I'm very excited about TA. I've spent quite a bit of time on the TA franchise in \u2013 was just again there a few weeks ago, or earlier last week. And this Discovery series thermal instrumentation platform is going to unfold over the next year and I think should provide us with some good growth opportunities.","So, while TA was the headline, there were also some other sectors within our industrial end markets that were solid. I mentioned the food and environmental business, which is a very global business. In fact, more than half of that business is outside the United States. And some of the trends that we see in China and in other world markets on food continue to underscore the attractiveness of that end market for us.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a million and congratulations on a solid quarter. So, Chris, can you \u2013 maybe the \u2013 one number that maybe surprised me a little bit was the Europe being so much stronger relative to some of the other geographies, up 12%. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what you \u2013 I know Europe isn't one geography, but maybe talk about what you're seeing in Europe? And then any early insights given your presence in the UK and just kind of what people are thinking about and kind of what's embedded in your expectations for the second half of Europe given the decision over there?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure, sure, happy to comment a little on those things. Yeah, Europe was a really good quarter. As you know, Europe is pharma heavy, and we really saw a lot of strength in the recurring revenues there as well as solid instrument business, and so I think what we're seeing in Europe is just a reflection of what we're seeing more broadly on the pharma side.","As we look at the back half of the year, I tend to take at a look at the entire first half and not one quarter in particular, and while we're, I would say, optimistic generally on the pharma market, the \u2013 we're more cautious on the industrial and academic markets in Europe in general. So, I'd say, we have a balanced outlook for the back half of the year in Europe that we're really keying off of the overall first half experience.","As it relates to the UK, we're in a unique situation in England as well as in Europe broadly, with a big part of our mass spec footprint in the region, and by the way, don't forget that we also have significant operations in Ireland. So, we really have quite an opportunity to balance a number of considerations over time depending on how the exit plays out, depending on how currencies play out, depending on what trade barriers or trade agreements get struck, what type of tariffs ensue.","Obviously, it's way too early to make any calls. We don't expect the government to invoke Article 50 for some time, probably into early to mid-2017. There is a lot of posturing right now. The new government is just forming in England or in the UK and not really showing its hand. We've done some work with some smart people who are beginning to conceptualize a couple of different possible scenarios. But really it's a stay calm and carry on message in our organization. We've really pushed our team to just remain focused on what we do well and what we can control.","As you know, it's a good end market for us in the UK, less than 5%, but a good end market, that's pretty well balanced between pharma and academic at the top of the list. But we also have a meaningful amount of R&D in the UK and in Ireland, as well as product costs. So in the near-term, we're benefiting from some of the weaker currency. But again, it's a dynamic situation and I'm confident that no matter how it shakes out, we'll have avenues to continue to be successful in that region not just from a commercial standpoint, but also from an operational standpoint.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot for the color. And then maybe, Gene, just as a follow up, do you mind for the year, so for the growth rate of kind of 6% to 7% for the year, do you mind kind of \u2013 do you mind sharing geographically how you are thinking that's going to shake out now?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Certainly on a qualitative level I'm happy to. I think that the strength that we've seen in the pharmaceutical end market looks like it has some sustainability. So thinking about the average growth rate for the company, I think it's realistic to think that the pharmaceutical sector will be at or slightly higher than that. We're a little bit more cautious on the government and academic. We're expecting that we'll see some improvements during the second half, but that still has to materialize. And, I would say that we're also a little bit more cautious on the industrial side.","So, looking at it from an end market point of view by application, I think we're most bullish on the continued strength of pharma, and a little bit more conservative on the public spending, and on the industrial side. Although, I think, for TA Instruments that will be a strong half given their new product flow.","Another way to look at our business is also looking at the instrumentation and the recurring revenue. We've had a very strong first half of 2016 on the recurring side, that segment of our business has historically been amenable to trending. So, envisioning that the recurring business will be at or slightly higher than the average growth rate I think is realistic. So, that's some color that I think might be helpful to you, Jon.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Very welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys. Just going back on pharma CapEx or CapEx in general. I mean how would you kind of characterize this cycle versus prior and sort of where we are in that cycle?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Ross, I'm going to defer to Gene on this to compare it to future cycles, but I want to just continue to emphasize that this market is not static and is dynamic and is developing and I think is quite different just feels to me, I \u2013 from all the data I see quite different from the past. And, I think, an interesting hypothesis and question is, is there less cyclicality, if you will in the market now, because of the increased diversity both geographically of the customer base, the type of firms, as well as the type of molecules that are comprising the world's pharma pipeline. And so, that's what we're obviously continuing to dig deep on, but maybe Gene can draw a broader historical perspective on this.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","No, I \u2013 and Ross, you have lived through these cycles also, as you've covered the space. And as Chris mentioned, as we become less reliant on our top customers for a high percentage of our pharmaceutical sales, I think, there is a good argument to say that the cyclicality might not have quite as much of highs and lows to it.","If I look at our recent performance, we've considerably expanded our pharmaceutical footprint in Asia with both China and India performing strongly and then within the U.S. and Europe, the shift to more generic manufacturers and more specialty pharma, also take away some of those big cyclical swings that we've seen with prior replacement cycles or with a big activity on the M&A front. So, I think, I'm just echoing pretty much what Chris mentioned, but hopefully that's helpful.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Well, I appreciate it. And just quickly, Gene, on the guidance from the original forecast, can you sort of breakout operational versus FX outperformance or differential?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, yes, I mean if I take a look at where we are year-to-date, so for the first half, we are still seeing a little bit of a drag from FX. If you recall on the first quarter call, we had about an $0.08 headwind that we dealt with from FX, and in the second quarter, we made up $0.06, so net, we're still $0.02 headwind for the half. Now, I think that we could easily see that go to neutral or slightly positive as we move into the second half.","I think one of the factors to consider is to look at currencies that are outside the majors. Obviously, we're benefiting from the stronger yen, but there are some secondary currencies that might provide us a little bit of headwind to do some offsetting and it's on that basis that we're thinking that for the full year, FX will be neutral to the top line and close to neutral, maybe a little bit positive on the EPS line. So frankly, this is the first year in many where you're able to see the true ability of the company to grow its top line and to get operational leverage without having to cut through all the noise that FX has historically provided us.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, Gene.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.","Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone and thanks for the time here. Just one clarification and then one bigger picture question for Chris. First, Gene, I wonder if you could give us a sense for where the strength in TA is manifesting geographically just as we try to get back to an apples-to-apples view on geographic trends.","And then for Chris, within your thinking and the discussions around the strategic plan and what you want to present sounds like in 2017, can you give us any updated thoughts on what the binding constraints are, as you think about capital deployment? Are you confining these discussions and thoughts to smaller tuck-in deals? Are you confining them to accretive deals? Are you constraining any potential impact on margins? Any evolving thinking there would be very helpful. Thank you.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Well, first to say a little bit about the TA strength that we're seeing, I think it's very encouraging to see that we're seeing the most strength in our largest markets, including Europe, Japan and the United States. One of the things to consider as you begin to look at the TA business is the effect that we have not only from this new Discovery launch, but from all of the additional technologies, that TA has been adding in recent years.","In the quarter, we just got a little bit of tailwind from M&A. Right now, our guidance assumes that most of the growth that we have from TA will be organic, as we look at the second half of the year. So, clearly, the markets that are most receptive to new technologies and material characterization, the more developed markets, Europe, Japan, the U.S. are the ones that are showing the greatest promise, as they quickly adopt the new Discovery series. Was that \u2013 does that answer your question, Steve?","Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","On TA, yes, it does. Thanks, Gene.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. Stephen, just on the strategy process, maybe a couple of additional comments, and certainly, it's been a very energizing process for the team to build on where we are today, to start think about a framework for the future, and one thing I remind everybody internally is as well as I'll remind you externally is that, it's a process, it's an ongoing process of continuing to refine our focus on what makes us unique and different, and how we win in the markets that we choose to play in with the emphasis on choice.","And, obviously the first question in any strategic plan needs to be a really granular characterization of what your core business is, and a plan to make sure we're maximizing our performance and our effectiveness in our core business. And then, obviously to look at things that we can uniquely offer to our other growth markets and gain scale in those markets.","As it relates to the question of capital deployment and any as you said, binding constraints, I think it's probably premature to comment on that. The priority is growth, of course, growth in revenue and growth in profits. And, we're going to look at the overall growth equation and frankly try to balance some long-term financial objectives to balance growth profitability, the right investments. And, of course, return on invested capital. Return on invested capital is a big priority for me.","As it relates to the role of M&A, I've been pretty clear before and I remain of the same mind that M&A is a tactic that we would employ only as a way to execute our business strategy. Our aim is to be primarily an organic innovator, and to not only retain but enhance our position as the industry's most vital organic innovator. We think that's the highest return on invested capital over time.","And, over time, the company has, I think made smart acquisitions, but it's been not a regular part of the business formula. And so, I don't see deviating all that much, although I think as we look forward, we want to make sure we're taking advantage of all means to achieve the goals that I outlined.","So, I think it's going to be a balanced and a pragmatic, and a disciplined and a responsible approach to capital allocation that is really all aimed at making us successful in our core business and very carefully building scale and other big opportunities that can grow over time.","Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam from Avondale Partners. Sir, your line is open.","Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC","Thanks for taking the question. So, Chris, maybe if you look at your instrument business, historically I think for the developed markets, a lot of the growth was driven the replacement cycle of your install base. I was curious as to if you might be able to assess where that might be, or do you think there is a significant driver coming from further market expansion?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure, it's a fair question, Sung Ji, and we do have a healthy replacement cycle. Obviously in our core routine methods, there is a natural replacement cycle. I wouldn't say there is anything out of ordinary right now in terms of where we're at. At the same time, we do look to expand our technology into new work flows earlier in the development process, and geographically as more companies get in the game, particularly in some of the emerging markets. So I think we're trying to achieve as balanced as possible an overall portfolio of where our instrument platforms are used and, as we said in the call, also try to be very innovative, and in and the example I used in the call, continuing to emphasize the use of mass detection as a supplement to traditional optical and UV detection in chromatography workflows. We think that has a lot of value to our customers, particularly in some of the more complex larger molecule and bio type of applications, and we look forward to that playing through into more and more routine methods all the way through QC over time. And so that tends to be our focus, and obviously balance our instrument business with a very sharp focus on our chemistry consumables and our service offering.","Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC","Okay. And then on the operating leverage side, one of the questions I get a lot is whether there's further headroom for you guys in terms of improving on that. And so, it seems like there are some initiatives underway and was curious as to what the additional levers are and what you guys are actually working on? Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure. No, that's a fair question. And I think, as Gene stated, now that we're in somewhat more of a neutral currency environment and you're seeing our top line work, you are seeing our desired model for operating leverage, which is first and foremost driven by volume and growth, but also consistent discipline around many levers if you will, up and down the P&L.","In a broad sense, I would say, my goals are to continue to be a premier top line grower on this regard, maintain our price discipline, continue to look for mix opportunities, absorbing our cost with volume and also getting leverage out of our G&A, and ability to scale our sales and marketing efforts, while at the same time making sure we're investing enough and healthily in innovation. We've gradually ticked up our investment in R&D. And I would like to continue to do that as long as I'm convinced that we're getting high productivity out of R&D and spending a lot of time on portfolio management right now in that regard. And I am confident that we're getting good productivity out of our R&D. And so that's an area of investment that we feel we can pay for with a number of other levers over time. And to ideally achieve that optimal mix between growth and modest leverage while continuing to invest to grow. So that's the framework, that's the ideas and we'll put more specifics on that as we move forward.","Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Sir, your line is open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Good morning. What percentage of your costs are in British pounds? And are there geographies where you generally have a stronger mass spec business that may be more positively impacted by the pound?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. I mean, just maybe I'll start off and Gene can develop it. Right now, we have somewhere between a quarter and a third of our R&D expenses out of our UK facility, and about 15% of our COGS. And so, those are expenses that are obviously well ahead of our revenue concentration in those markets. And so obviously, while the UK is a good commercial market for us, it's really an even more important operational center.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","I think you said it well, Chris. I would just say that, as you begin to think about currency moves, our ability to sell high-end mass spectrometry into Japan at this time would be a positive for us because we'd be leveraging the strength of the yen and the weakness of the pound.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And besides the weakness in Japan and the slight decline in the U.S., is the academic market weak across the board? And besides improvement in the U.S. in the back half of the year, what other geographical trends are you anticipating? In the academic market specifically.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, there are some developing markets that tend to be lumpy, that showed some positive growth in the quarter. Bryan, I would just remind you that much of our academic business is centered on research mass spectrometry workflows. So the business tends to be a little bit lumpy, and it tends to be somewhat dependent on our new product launches. So we're very encouraged by what our pipeline looks like from some recently introduced research mass spectrometry programs. And hopefully when we're talking to you about the third and fourth quarters of this year, we can talk about some nice pickup of these research platforms in the public sector.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you very much.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Ma'am, your line is open.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. I just actually had one on the consumables side. So the launch of the CORTECS Columns, it seems like that's been quite successful for you. I was curious as you look at the growth in consumables this quarter or generally over the year so far, how much of it's driven by some of these newer proprietary products that you've launched and general mix shift towards the higher attach rate instruments versus just kind of per instrument increases? I was curious about that.","And then, also, kind of I think you talked a little bit about this, but going forward, what's the opportunity for you on the consumable side in terms of proprietary products?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure. Maybe just I'll start and Gene can add to it. I would say that the current performance is a lot more driven by the second thing you said, Amanda, in terms of kind of a gradual mix shift in our install base towards higher utilization platforms. As you know, our ACQUITY platform, our UPLC platform has a higher attach rate than our legacy HPLC systems; and so, as UPLC continues to gradually grow in its presence in the marketplace, that provides us with a nice opportunity on the consumable side.","I think new products like the CORTECS are still quite early in their phase of adoption, and so there is not necessarily a big tailwind that we're getting from that in the immediate time. But obviously that type of innovation with solid-core technology and the efficiency gains in \u2013 across a number of different workflows is a really attractive offering to the market. And we expect to add to our competitive advantage.","Obviously, we have a large portfolio of consumables in chromatography and as you allude to, an increasing presence and interest in kits, like the glycan kits I referred to earlier, like ProteinWorks and some other specialty applications, where we think we can do even more. So, we really like this part of the business, we think we're competitively differentiated on the chemistry side with a significant chemistry expertise at our core. And we're only continuing to increase the emphasis of those development efforts.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","The thing that I would add to that is, I think, Chris did an excellent job in describing some of the product trends that we're seeing on the consumable side. But as you begin to look at the consumable growth and also look at the service growth, those two statistics are compatible with higher utilization rates of our instrumentation and also the increased number of \u2013 the increased installed base in some of our larger Asian markets where we have over a number of quarters exhibited strong double digit growth rates and these growth rates represent significant increases in the installed base, which in turn drive not only the consumables business as Chris noted, but also the service business.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Sir, your line is open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just one for me on forecasting and how the inter-quarter dynamics are playing out for you guys these days. Gene, are you finding that as the business has evolved that there has been any change to the pacing of the orders such that the back-end loading in the last couple of weeks is not as heavy as it used to be or is it kind of the way that it's always been in that respect?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","That's a good question, Dan, and you know in recent quarters, we've noted that with the recurring revenue growth being so strong and with the linear type of ordering in sales patterns that you see for the recurring revenue. One of the effects there has been to take that hockey stick dynamic that we see with capital purchases that is at the end of a quarter and maybe make it less of a sharp curve. I think that the quarters where we tend to see more of the quarter end pick up are in the first quarter when people are waiting for budgets to be released and then in the fourth quarter when people are making sure that they use their calendar budget before the New Year starts. I can tell you that last year that fourth quarter hockey stick was just a little bit more tempered than it has been in prior years and another dynamic is just the increasing component of our business in Asia, where just historically, this sort of ordering and selling pattern was not as pronounced as it had been in Western Europe and North America.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks, Dan. I think we have time for one more question, Liz.","Operator","All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Sir, your line is open.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just have a follow up and then one quick question for Chris. First off for the follow-up for Gene, Gene to some of your other comments regarding the movement of the yen and your exposure to the pound, I'm surprised that you're not expecting an even larger positive impact from the changes in FX, given your manufacturing R&D exposure in the pound that has moved in the past four weeks or so. So I'm just wondering if you could \u2013 given that you benefited from FX by $0.06 here in the quarter, the pound really didn't move until the end of your second quarter, I would have thought that the FX impact would be even larger in the second half of the year. Then I have just one quick follow up for Chris.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, there \u2013 we did have a $0.06 benefit in the quarter for FX but we did assume that we would have a little bit of benefit. So that was the total. So, the guidance did make the assumption that we would not have the same currency dynamics as we had in the first quarter. So, as I begin to look at the second half of the year, and look at the total effects of currencies, not only the majors but also some of the secondary currencies, I think that envisioning that we can get someplace $0.05 to $0.07 during the second half of the year on FX. If everything stays relatively constant, in terms of the geographic and product distribution of our business, I think that's probably a ballpark estimate that's reasonable and assumed in the guidance that we provided.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. And then, for Chris or Gene, I think you sort of alluded to this, Chris, a bit with some of your \u2013 you're working on longer-term strategic planning. But just wondering if you had any thoughts or comments as it relates to, you guys are continuing to post pretty strong free cash flow and you obviously have quite a bit of net cash on the balance sheet. So, I'm just wondering, do you have any thoughts on potentially stepping up the share repurchase program that you guys have been doing historically?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","I think, Steve, that's a fair question, just as it relates to overall capital allocation, and we'll take your compliment that we are generating a lot of very strong free cash flow right now. Obviously, one of the challenges we have is where that cash is located relative to the ability to use it for kind of U.S. purposes, like share repurchase. I think we have a very well-established share repurchase program. We return a significant portion of that free cash flow to shareholders. I think at the \u2013 at a leading level in the industry, and so, really for the foreseeable future we expect to continue that practice and obviously, any adaptation to that over time would be carefully thought through and discussed.","So, the question of capital allocation is a fair question. It goes part and parcel with our strategic outlook, and as we get further down the line, we'll put more specifics on all that. But thanks for the question, appreciate it and look forward to the continuing dialogue.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","So, with that, maybe, Liz, thanks and I'll move to some closing comments to close the call. So really to conclude, as we move into the second half of the year, and begin to broaden our focus to 2017 and beyond, we are encouraged as we commented today by our first half performance. We're encouraged by the condition of our key end markets as well as by the strength of our product positions. All that said, we do live in a dynamic world and will continue to balance our optimism with a business plan that can adapt unforeseen changes in market conditions, so that we can continue to deliver reliable financial results.","So on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on October 25, 2016.

Sir, you may begin.","Brian Brockmeyer","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the first quarter and full year 2018.

In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today\u2019s call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Waters\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris O\u2019Connell. Chris?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today, along with Brian Brockmeier, Waters\u2019 newly appointed Head of Investor Relations. Joining me on this morning\u2019s call is Sherry Buck, Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer and John Lynch, Corporate Treasurer.","Before we get started, I would like to thank John for his leadership of the Waters\u2019 Investor Relations function over the last several years. Moving forward, John will be focusing on Corporate Finance and Treasury activities. During today\u2019s call, I will provide an overview of our Q4 and full year 2017 operating results as well as some broader commentary on our current business environment. Sherry will then review financial details for our reported results and provide our 2018 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.","I am very pleased with our fourth quarter and 2017 in total. We finished 2017 with a strong quarter of sales growth in our key end markets highlighted by broad-based strength from pharmaceutical customers, a rebounding U.S. market and balanced product mix. For the full year 2017, the highlight to me was the great revenue balance across end markets, geographies and product lines resulting in consistent sales performance and double-digit earnings per share growth in each quarter of the year. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was up 6% against a very strong comparison of 9% growth in the same period in 2016. Earnings per share grew 14% in the fourth quarter. This strong finish in Q4 led to full year revenue growth of 6%, a strong P&L featuring modest operating leverage while investing in promising growth initiatives and 13% earnings per share growth for the full year. Additionally, we delivered very strong free cash flow growth of 10% in 2017.","Taking a closer look and starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 8% in the quarter, highlighted by strong demand from U.S. pharmaceutical customers, continued double digit pharma growth in China and a solid pharma rebound in India. For the full year global sales growth from pharma was 7% against a strong base of comparison of 10% in 2016. Throughout the year we continued to see consistent sustainable results driven by our increasingly diverse base of customers, attractive geographical balance and strong product positions in our small molecule, large molecule and medical research applications. Our ongoing strategy work continues to emphasize the vast opportunities in our pharmaceutical business where we believe we are very well positioned to expand our core technologies into a greater breadth of applications to meet the growing and increasingly complex requirements of our customers.","Sales to our worldwide industrial category which includes the materials characterization food and environmental and fine chemical markets were flat in the quarter against a very tough 14% comparison in the prior year\u2019s quarter. For the full year we delivered a solid 5% growth in our industrial category and saw growth across all of our key geographies and major product lines. We continue to be excited about our industrial product positions and pipeline and the breadth of opportunity across materials characterization, food safety and environmental applications. Looking at our governmental and academic category, sales grew by 13% in Q4 with broad based performance across all major geographies. In particular, we saw strong spending in the quarter from academic institutions focused on biomedical and Omex research. For the full year 2017 our governmental and academic category grew a very solid 6% though as we have consistently stated this business is a smaller part of our mix and sales tend to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter.","Next I will review our performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia now our largest region in terms of revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter, led by China which grew 14% against a very strong comparison in the prior year period. Our China operations saw a solid growth from all key end markets. Also in the region India rebounded nicely in Q4 as we successfully work through disruption caused in the third quarter due to the implementation of the new GST system. For the full year Asia grew 10% highlighted by 17% growth in China, high single-digit growth in India and steady growth in Japan. Turning to the Americas, sales grew 6% for the quarter with U.S. sales up and encouraging 9%, sales in the U.S. was broad based across key end markets and product lines. We were encouraged by the pickup in spending from midsize and large U.S. pharmaceutical customers who had been more cautious earlier in the year. For the full year sales in the Americas were flat with the U.S. growing 1% as second half growth more than offset the first half declines.","Europe continued to be a strong contributor with fourth quarter sales growing 7%, highlighted by broad based growth across the region from our pharmaceutical and medical research customers. We saw European strength in small molecule applications and continued performance in biopharma applications where we are well positioned with our targeted LCMS and biopharmaceutical separation solutions. We also saw strong service revenue from our large and growing base of installed systems. For the year Europe grew 8% delivering strong and steady results throughout the year.","Finally I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded products \u2013 Waters branded instrument sales grew 3% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year, led by a particular strength in core LC and LCMS systems sold to our pharmaceutical customers. Within instruments, I would like to highlight our bench-top LC tandem mass spectrometry systems led by our higher end Xevo TQ-XS as well as the workhorse Xevo TQS Micro. LCMS systems continued to grow solidly in the quarter and consistently for the full year. As we have commented on in the past we continue to see the expansion of mass spec technology into routine quantification workflows primarily in food safety and biopharmaceutical applications. The development of our tandem quadrupole Xevo platform has enabled us to meet the evolving demands for reproducible quantification capabilities for both small and large molecules. Waters\u2019 branded recurring revenues, the combination of service and precision chemistries, which represent approximately 50% of the corporation\u2019s business, grew 9% in the quarter. Recurring revenues were driven by global strength for our service, HPLC and UPLC application kits and complete chemistry offerings. For the full year, our service and chemistry revenues grew 7% indicative of high utilization rates for the installed base of Waters instruments.","Turning to our TA product line, sales grew by 10% in the quarter bringing full year growth to a strong 8%. Instrument system sales for TA grew 12% in the quarter and 11% for the year with broad-based growth across thermal analysis and rheology product lines. Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunities to capitalize on the rising innovation in highly engineered high-performance materials. We will continue to emphasize our discovery series of thermal analyzers while continuing system launches that will add to an already fresh and strong product line.","Stepping back, I am pleased with the consistent top line and bottom line results that Waters delivered all four quarters over the past year and I am excited about all we have ahead of us in 2018. As we drive for consistent execution again in 2018, we also remain steadfastly focused on our 5-point long-term value creation model. As I have consistently communicated, we aim to create shareholder value by number one, holding a highly differentiated leadership positions in structurally attractive markets; number two, executing a clear and focused growth strategy driven by organic innovation; number three, programmatically driving continuous operational improvement; number four, being a disciplined capital allocator; and number five, operating with the performance-oriented culture and management team.","As we look to 2018, we are anticipating solid market conditions across our key customer defined end markets. In pharma, we continue to see macro trends at rising global regulatory standards increasing global patient access to prescription drugs and the growing testing needs of new biologic drugs that feature in ever increasing complexity of molecular structure. In materials, food and environmental, demand remains strong driven by healthy global industrial conditions and the general rise of regulatory standards for performance and quality. All of these market trends point to customer needs that can be well served by Waters\u2019 core technologies and a greater breadth of applications optimized with our particular strengths in chemistry, software and professional service.","Lastly, I would like to make some comments on tax reform generally and the impact on Waters specifically. Overall, I am very positive about what tax reform means for U.S. economic conditions and the overall competitiveness of the U.S. economy. In particular, I am intrigued about the positive implications for increasing U.S. capital deployment by companies of all kinds. Sherry will provide details on the short-term effects of the new law on our tax rate. But before she does, I would like to share my thoughts on capital allocation and the new opportunities created for Waters under the new tax loss.","As you know, Waters has always been a judicious allocator of capital. We look at our capital allocation strategy in three levels: number one, invest in the business; number two, enhance our balance sheet strength and flexibility; and number three, return capital to shareholders. Now, with tax efficient access to our significant global free cash flow, we see great opportunity in all three of these areas. In terms of investing in the business, there is now opportunity to invest in the United States at a lower cost of capital where our cash can be very efficiently deployed alongside our innovation processes and supply chain operations.","While we already have a strong balance sheet full access to our global cash flow gives us the opportunity to optimize our capital structure for maximum flexibility and opportunistic investments. In terms of returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, tax reform provides us with confidence in the sustainability of our program and additional flexibility to enhance return of capital to shareholders. Looking forward, we will proceed carefully and thoughtfully in evaluating our opportunities for enhanced capital deployment. As we do this, I will continue to view our significant cash balances as a strategic asset of the company that can wait patiently as we seek the right opportunities to invest in high return on investment initiatives.","With that, I would like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper look of the fourth quarter and our full year financials. Sherry?","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. We recorded net sales in the fourth quarter of $687 million, an increase of about 6% before currency translation which increased sales growth in the quarter by about 3% and resulted in 9% reported sales growth. For the full year sales grew by 6% before currency translation which increased sales growth by 1%.","In the quarter pharmaceutical markets grew 8% and industrial markets were flat and sales to academic and governmental customers were up 13%. For the full year pharmaceutical markets grew 7%, our industrial markets grew 8% \u2013 5% excuse me and sales to academic and governmental customers were up 6%. Product line growth was strongest in our recurring revenue with the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue growing 8% while instrument sales grew 4% in the quarter. For the full year recurring revenue grew 7%, while sales of our instrument product groups grew 5%.","Breaking the quarter down further sales relating to Waters branded products and services were up 5%, while TA sales grew 10%. Combined LC and LCMS instrument platform sales increased by 3% and TA\u2019s instrumentation system sales grew 12%. As we continue to see the benefits of new product introductions. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 8%. Looking at our growth rates in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, sales in Americas were up 6% with sales in the U.S. increasing 9%. European sales were up 7% and sales in Asia were up 6% led by strong growth in China and India.","Now I would like to comment on our fourth quarter\u2019s non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter were 60.6% versus 60% in the fourth quarter of 2016 showing a strong finish to the year. For the full year gross margins were slightly better than the prior year at 59%. Moving down the fourth quarter\u2019s P&L, operating expenses were up 9% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency translation increased operating expense growth by about 2% on a reported basis, stronger than anticipated revenue growth resulted in higher variable expenses in the quarter. For the full year operating expenses were impacted by R&D expense growing faster than sales as we continue to invest in product development and innovation which is a key component of our value creation model that Chris spoke to earlier.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate in the quarter before the effects of the new U.S. tax cuts and jobs act which are referred to as tax reform and the new stock compensation rule was about 15%. Including a $0.07 benefit from new stock option accounting rules the non-GAAP effective operating tax rate was about 13%. In the quarter as a result of tax reform we incurred a GAAP tax expense charge of $550 million, nearly 90% of this amount is associated with the transition tax on earnings and profits outside the U.S. This charge represents our best estimate and the actual expense may differ from this estimate due to further refinement of our calculations or additional guidance that may become available. For the full year our effective operating tax rate before the effects of tax reform and the new stock compensation rule was 14.7% versus 14.1% in 2016. The increase in the effective operating tax rate was driven by the mix of our earnings in higher tax rate jurisdictions, including a $0.24 benefit from the new stock option accounting rules the non-GAAP effective operating tax rate was 11.8%.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $4 million and our average share count on a fully diluted basis equivalent came in at 80.4 million shares or approximately 1 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter last year. This is the net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program. During the quarter we bought 431,000 shares of our common stock for $85 million our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were up 14% to $2.51 in comparison to earnings of $2.21 last year. On a GAAP basis we reported a loss of $4.44 versus earnings at $2.15 last year. As noted previously, our GAAP earnings in Q4 2017 include the impact of tax reform. Both of our non-GAAP and GAAP earnings include a benefit of $0.07 resulting from the new stock compensation accounting rules. The impact of foreign currency translation in the quarter on earnings per share was a positive $0.08 bringing the full year impact to about $0.09. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 13% to $7.49 per share versus $6.62 last year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share were $0.25 versus $6.41 in 2016. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $3.4 billion and debt totaled $2 billion bringing us to a net cash position of $1.4 billion. We defined free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2017, cash flow was strong and came in at $162 million after funding $30 million of capital expenditures. This represents both a strong quarterly performance and a full year growth of approximately 10%. We were able to convert $0.27 of free cash from every dollar\u2019s worth of sales for the full year. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, which is even with the third quarter and flat from the fourth quarter of last year. In the quarter, inventories were approximately $270 million compared to $263 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year, which was in line with our expectations.","Looking ahead to 2018, our outlook generally assumes continued stable demand from our pharmaceutical and industrial end markets, consistent growth and recurring revenue and balanced growth rates from our geographies. These dynamics lead up to a mid single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2018. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to increase 2018 sales growth by about 1%. Gross margins for the year are expected to be consistent with the prior year in the range between 58.5% to 59%. Our plan for the full year is to manage operating expense growth at a rate that is less than our sales growth.","Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $16 million to $17 million, a reduction as compared to 2017 due to the increased flexibility and deploying our cash balances as a result of tax reform. We estimate our full year tax rate, which reflects the impact of tax reform and stock compensation rules to be in the range of 13% to 15%. This includes an estimated impact of about 2% related to provisions in the new tax reform law. Breaking this down further, we were estimating a positive impact in the range of 1% to 2% due to lower U.S. tax rates. However, this is offset by an unfavorable impact in the range of 2% to 3% as a result of the intangible and base broadening provisions and a lower tax benefit from stock compensation as a result of the U.S. tax rate reduction to 21% from 35%. We expect to further refine our full year tax rate as we gain more clarity on the tax reform regulations and will provide updates as appropriate.","Our guidance regarding capital allocation assumes continuation of our share repurchase program through 2018 at a rate that will result in an average diluted share count of about 78.5 million shares outstanding. This share count assumes a share repurchase plan for the year that will approximately offset the impact to our tax rate from tax reform. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis full year 2018 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within the range of $8 to $8.25. At current rates, the foreign currency impact on full year earnings per share growth is expected to be about neutral.","Now, looking at the first quarter of 2018, we expect constant currency sales growth in the mid single-digits. At today\u2019s rates, currency translation is expected to positively impact first quarter sales growth by about 2%. Other key assumptions for Q1 include a moderate increase in expenses as well as an estimated increase in our overall tax rate in Q1 of about 5% to 6%. The Q1 tax rate is impacted by tax reform and a strong $0.09 base of comparison from the stock option compensation benefit in the first quarter of 2017. Lastly there was one less calendar day in the quarter versus last year. We estimate first quarter earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.48 to $1.60 with an approximate 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation at current rates.","Now I would like to turn the call back to Chris. Chris?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Great. Thank you, Sherry. As we move into 2018 we will continue to emphasize execution in our core businesses and delivering on our operating performance objectives. As we have stated we will seek to balance growth, operating leverage and investment in the business. With that we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get everyone\u2019s questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and if you have additional questions please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, can we have the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hi. Chris, I want to start with the rebound in the U.S. market, good pharma strength, good academic, can you maybe just talk on those two trends how you are feeling, kind of exiting the year, was there any budget flush dynamic and in other segments?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes. Thanks Tycho. Yes, we were as I said in the prepared remarks we were encouraged by the U.S. As you know the first half of the year we sustained some declines as it was pretty clear at the time and an even more clear in retrospect that there was caution on the part of a lot of U.S. companies particularly in pharma and some of the industrial businesses really waiting some of the regulation and policy and tax changes that came later in the year. We did see as you recall some improvement in the third quarter in the U.S. and then we had a nice close to the year. So I would just say that the finish that we had hoped for in the U.S. was. There was a renewed sense of confidence in a pretty broad based way across the end markets. And we feel good about that going into the year. Now, obviously one quarter does not a trend make and so as we enter 2018 we are hopeful, but we are also balanced in terms of what might happen from here.","Tycho Peterson","And then you kind of maybe commented around cash being a strategic asset here, I understand there are lot of kind of moving pieces, but I guess as we think about the potential to bring back cash when do we expect we will get more granularity and visibility on that and then you kind of alluded to more investment here in U.S., I guess over what timeframe should we be thinking about that?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure. Based on the way the tax works and I will have Sherry comment further on some of the mechanics if you wish. Once we pay this toll tax, we have access to that cash. And obviously we are thoughtful in where that cash is to maximize the return on that cash while we go through our decision making on how to deploy it. And really my comment on cash is a strategic asset is a very thoughtful approach to making the right decisions in terms of allocation of capital to all of our priorities to invest in the business to show up our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders. We obviously have a great share repurchase program, as Sherry commented we are going to continue or even enhance that in the current year to offset some of the effects of the minor short-term tax rate increase. But we really have an eye towards being opportunistic I would say. In terms of investing in the U.S. as I mentioned it\u2019s a much more favorable investment environment and there are clearly some investments that historically maybe we have been a little more cautious on the U.S. given the uncertainty of the tax situation but now are taking a more careful look at and we will obviously provide more details on some of the things that we are considering as we develop those plans. But we are going to be patient and we are going to thoughtful, we are going to be careful about that because we are very fortunate to be in a position of having significant cash to allocate against a high return on investment opportunities.","Tycho Peterson","Does this change your view on M&A at all in terms of opportunities?","Chris O\u2019Connell","No, it doesn\u2019t change our view at all in M&A. As you know we are more organically driven. That said, we are also making sure we are aware of everything happening in the marketplace if we were to consider M&A would be from a strategic lens we would not change our approach relative to our investment priorities, but is a tactic to support a business strategy, we are open to it, but we would be very disciplined about it. And as I try to consistently say access to cash doesn\u2019t necessarily change our willingness to engage in M&A.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. First question on tax reform, Chris, are you in discussions with your customers, are you getting any early indication that tax reform is going to stimulate demand for Waters products in 2018?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes, Dan, it\u2019s a good question. And I would say it\u2019s too early for me to put too fine a point on that. I think what we saw with our customers and in discussions is just a general relief that tax reform is here and excitement about a more favorable investment environment in the United States. And in terms of tying specific purchases of our technology to that type an event, it\u2019s probably too early to make that directive a connection, but certainly there is a tone that\u2019s out there that\u2019s generally positive and we are grateful for that, but keep in mind, U.S. is really only about 30% of our overall business and half of that business is recurring revenue anyway. So, I think the effect you would see would be balanced.","Dan Leonard","Okay. And then from my follow-up question, how are you contemplating the potential for pharma M&A as you think about your guidance for 2018 from M&A and any potential disruptions associated with that?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes, I guess I am not really an expert in handicapping whether pharma M&A is going to accelerate or not. There is probably better sources for that but I think my view on pharma M&A is that as long as pharma M&A is being done for the reasons of enhancing product portfolios and therapeutic portfolios, which is generally what I think happens. I think it\u2019s something that wouldn\u2019t necessarily affect us all that much. At the end of the day most of our business is tied to late stage development and QA\/QC and we know that pharma companies who are under taking those type of strategies are looking to enhance their portfolios in the market and really leverage combinations to address overhead cost not necessarily innovation and certainly not production costs as it relates to serving the market. So either way, I think the demand for our products should be approximate and we will watch it carefully, but I don\u2019t really have a clear sense as to how that may play out.","Dan Leonard","Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good morning. I am really just going to ask one question, but maybe I will pick on a few parts within it. It\u2019s just a request to get a little bit deeper understanding of some of the components of the thinking around the top line outlook for 2018. I guess, first, Chris as I reflected back on your comments, you gave some pretty encouraging comments on pharma and how you think about pharma as a source of funds in 2018. I wonder if you could give us a sense for where you think pharma lands as a growth driver and the model relative to the long-term trend in the maybe 6%, 7% range. Could we do a little bit better maybe in 2018 as we get relief in the U.S.? Second, I didn\u2019t hear you talk about what you think about the trend in terms of academic funding, very strong quarter for the company there, some enthusiasm around academic funding in a number of parts of the U.S.? And then third started piloting with the multi-parter here, but could you talk a little bit about the balance between hardware growth in 2018 and recurring growth in 2018, particularly around LCMS and then I will get back in queue and say thanks so much.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Good. Thank you, Steve. I will try to remember all of that. As it relates to pharma and our outlook for pharma, like I said, we were encouraged with the close to the year we had a good solid year of 7% pharma growth in total and that was on tough comp and that is ahead \u2013 a little bit ahead of the historic trend line, so just to remind on the historic trend line, the long-term trend line of pharma growth for us tends to be around 6%, which is a little ahead of the market. We have been doing a little bit better than that recently. In terms of our assumptions for \u201818, again, we go into a year with a balanced outlook. We don\u2019t assume in our guidance that everything goes right even though we strive for to do as well as we can. So, we are watching the market carefully particularly the U.S. as I mentioned before one quarter does not a trend make, but I would say we are hopeful for more stable conditions particularly United States as we enter the year based on the additional certainty there is relative to tax reform and some other factors. As it relates to academic funding, again we are not probably the best proxy, not the best proxy for that type of question since academic and government is a smaller percentage of our business. Academic though is the lion\u2019s share of our government and academic category. We had a good year there. We had 6% growth, but keep in mind the prior year we had a 3% decline. As you know, that business tends to be quite lumpy. And while we did see decent trends in the back half of the year for the academic world, particularly really in all geographies around the world, it\u2019s never entirely clear how sustainable that is, so, again looking at balance coming into the year in sort of the middle or part of our guidance for historical kind of range of academic type performance. And then I think the last question you asked about was instrument growth. We had a solid instrument year overall of 4% growth and that was on a comp of 6% the prior year. And in the fourth quarter, our instrument growth was about 3%, but against a very tough comp of 9% for the prior year, so really pretty consistent with historical trends you are seeing our instrument growth that is slightly slower than our overall top line average with chemistry and service doing a little bit better than the average in that mix continues to gradually migrate towards the recurring revenue. So, I don\u2019t think there is anything that unusual going on there other than to say we are pleased with the solid performance across all those categories.","Operator","And we will go to our next question it\u2019s from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Tim Evans","Thanks. Chris, I just want to push a little bit on the tax reform, because this is such a massive change to potentially to your capital structure and investment paradigm. Two specific questions and maybe you can answer about your long-term targets. Number one, do you want to continue to be in a net cash position or do you at some point in the future anticipate being in a net debt position. Obviously, your balance sheet should be able to sustain our net debt position given your cash flow. Second question is in the long run do you anticipate your R&D expenditures or your CapEx to be materially higher as a percentage of revenue than they are now given the ability to invest differently in the U.S.? Thanks.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes, thanks, Tim. Appreciate the question. In terms of long-term goals of net cash or net debt, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have a pre-described formula in our head. We want to do the right things to be great capital allocators. I think that\u2019s the bottom line. Like I said, cash is a great asset for us to have and we want to make sure we are flexible to invest opportunistically when the right opportunities present themselves across that entire range of capital allocation priorities. If that means that we are more cash heavy until that happens fine, if that means at some point we find the right opportunity to invest and get more debt heavy that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s really going to be a function of the return on invested capital, which have been consistent in terms of being the priority and at what point in time those investments are most fruitful. As it relates to changes in R&D and CapEx, I think you have seen me really emphasize R&D in terms of the returns to the company and the organic growth strategy. In fact, I was looking at some numbers last night and our R&D over the last 5 years has very steadily grown and conservatively grown from about 7.5% of products revenue that\u2019s excluding service where there isn\u2019t any R&D, but 7.5% of products revenue to 8.5% of products revenue over the last 5 years in a very gradual study way and I like that. I am pleased with that, because we have also been able to cover that with efficiency gains in other parts of the P&L to deliver modest ongoing operating leverage. As it relates to CapEx, we have been a pretty steady 3.5% to 4% of sales type CapEx company and CapEx investments and opportunities to invest in CapEx, we would look at, but if there anything major we would obviously give more information as we assess those opportunities. So I would characterize the answer overall is open minded, but very disciplined and patient to B grade capital allocators.","Tim Evans","Understood, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hey, good morning. Hey, where are we in the industrial analytical instrument growth cycle, I mean the market has been rounding, but still been a little bit slower than I would have thought, I guess can you sort of talk about some of the industrial end market demands and just what your chemical customers doing, some of your material sciences customers and just do you expect that segment to accelerate significantly in 2018?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 Derik, I think the industrial marketplace is in a good space right now. Heading into last year we were a little more cautious for particularly some of the U.S. type reasons, but as the year played out and we look at the year as a total body work. Industrial was right in the \u2013 right in the zone of the mid single-digits in a solid and we believe hopefully sustainable way. And obviously that\u2019s reinforced by a broader global economic backdrop of a pretty good balance in most major geographies around the world, good growth, employment pictures are pretty solid, relatively low rates of inflation. So the overall economic backdrop and many people comment on this has been supportive of that. In our quarter there were some core key one-time type factors year-over-year as I mentioned we are in a 14% growth in industrial in the fourth quarter of \u201816. And so if you look at a stacked comp quarter-to-quarter is solid and we also had some lingering effects that hit the industrial category are related to the natural disaster aftereffects in Latin America. So there were some kind of one timers in there, but maybe the best proxy for us in terms of what\u2019s currently happening in industrial is TA Instruments, you mentioned material science, material characterization, which is the heart and soul of TA. And TA had a solid year as we mentioned. That business does tend to be historically a little more lumpy, because it\u2019s more instrument oriented, but TA is probably a more indicative of the underlying. Picture in industrial and obviously TA we are getting better than average results, because of the new product platform that we have the market, the discovery series and so we are doing even better than maybe underlying demand, because of that new technology in the market. But I would characterize industrial overall as reasonably stable. I am not one to call cycles, so we are just going to again watch it carefully as we go into the year and have a balanced outlook that I think it gives us some confidence and reasonable performance as we look at \u201818.","Derik de Bruin","Great. And just one follow-up on this, so in the LC business and the QA QC business, I guess how much is the \u2013 the demands are very good for a while, I mean how much demand right now is replacement business versus capacity addition in the QA QC market, I am just curious is like how many new plants are going, I mean obviously some of your end customers are consolidating manufacturing, I am just wondering how you think about that the dynamic between new adds versus consolidation versus replacement?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes. There is some, generally, about half of the business out there is sort of replacing older units that are going out of service and about half is new adds. And I think the underlying thing that I look at is just the volume of testing activity and to me that\u2019s in two different ways. One is just the additional testing activity related volume and looking at global prescriptions and global pill counts and the rising access to medications that many people are enjoying around the world, practically in the emerging markets. That\u2019s sort of a steady drumbeat of fleet expansion if you will and opportunity for new entrants. We have a pretty broad pharmaceutical customer base, so it\u2019s not just about big companies replacing their products and expanding plants, it\u2019s also about a lot of new upstarts that you see across the range from innovator molecules to generics. And then obviously the testing activity on the innovator side with more and more focus being on biomolecules and more elaborate testing methods, those are both things that add up to that total activity which really yields at the end of the day, expansion of fleet, new facility and then some kind of drumbeat of replacement is older technologies need to be replaced.","Derik de Bruin","Thanks.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Dan Arias","Hi, good morning. Thanks. Chris, maybe just to finish the thought on Derik\u2019s question, how should we think about TA growth this year given the things that you mentioned?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes. So again like I will go back to the theme that that we have a balanced outlook for TA, TA obviously had a strong year, they have tough comps obviously coming into the year with the kind of year they had. So, the counter starts at zero again and it\u2019s a big hill decline. And as long as the overall industrial conditions in the market are favorable, I think we feel we have got the product portfolio to compete in that market. But again our guidance doesn\u2019t assume that everything goes right although my expectation is to for TA to perform with the company average or better.","Dan Arias","Okay. Then maybe just as a follow-up, two quick geography questions on Europe, obviously things right there in a pretty good place, can you touch on Western versus Eastern Europe and then how those two shape up for the year when think about your overall outlook for the region in \u201818. And then also just curious what you are thinking on Japan if you are giving the ups and downs that we have had there?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure. In terms of Europe, it was noteworthy in Europe this year to have the type of consistency we had across the year. And it was I would say consistency quarter-to-quarter that was somebody unusual historically. And I think it reflects the broad base of reasonable economic conditions in the background. We actually had kind of an unusual dynamic where for the better part of the year all four regions within Europe were in positive territory Northern Europe, Western Europe, Central Europe and \u2013 sorry Northern Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe had a good year that that business had been down and in some prior years, but had a reasonable year. I think we are hoping for again a balanced outlook as we come to this year, but I certainly don\u2019t know enough to forecast individual sub-geographies with any precision. But Europe has been a solid performer for us really driven by that solid base of pharmaceutical customers throughout Europe as well as reasonable biomedical research world. Japan had a solid year. Japan was a pretty typical, kind of low to mid single-digit type grower for Waters in both the quarter and the year. And as you know Japan tends to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter based on how the different categories are doing in fiscal years and so forth. But our Japanese business has been in the broader picture quite stable and a good cash flow generator.","Dan Arias","Thanks so much.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","Okay, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to talk briefly about SG&A expense in the quarter, it grew 12% actually a little bit more in the fourth quarter, when we look at why the incremental margin wasn\u2019t a bit higher and a strong top line growth quarter, this is the line that jumps out at us, so I am just wondering was there some opportunistic investment in a period of growth and if so where were these targeted investments made and what are you looking for in terms of targeted returns either in 2018 or beyond?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure, sure, yes. Obviously, quarter-to-quarter dynamics in the P&L jump around a little bit, Doug, as you know. I would point you back to the big picture for the year we saw a 40 basis point expansion in our operating margin and I count that as good solid modest operating leverage what we are able to invest exactly to your point. We actually grew R&D expenses for the year at about double \u2013 about 10% constant currency even with the modest operating leverage and also grew our SG&A expenses slightly lower than sales for the year. So, for the quarter, there was some catch-up in terms of incentive compensation with the stronger than expected finish on the revenue line and some things that are probably more akin to what you might consider one-timers, but it is that balance that we are trying to strike, I will have Sherry comment a little bit further on the P&L, but I think overall we feel good about the year that delivered that balance of growth investment and operating leverage. So, Sherry, you want to add to that?","Sherry Buck","Yes. Just to highlight what Chris said, we go into each year really trying to manage our operating expenses to grow less than our top line and fourth quarter in particular because of the stronger performance we had some catch-up on variables and that\u2019s kind of our plan is to keep managing that. We have a number of things underway as we go into 2018 to put some more programmatic things behind, how we continue to get continuous improvement on our operating margins. So, we look for modest improvements.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. And thank you for that. And Sherry, I think one more for you. Just looking ahead and thinking about guidance specifically gross margin. We saw some nice momentum coming out of 2017, one might have thought that this would continue in 2018 at least to a level that\u2019s maybe a little bit higher than where you have guided, which is for essentially flat year-over-year gross margins. Would you just walk us through the puts and takes there and it seems like FX is likely part of this. So, if you wouldn\u2019t mind getting a little more specific there that would be helpful?","Sherry Buck","Sure. So on the gross margin line, the kind of big factors around that obviously with higher volume or higher sales we would be able to give positive impact being able to offset fixed cost absorption, but really mix plays a really big part as we look at the mix of our sales both geographically as well as service revenues. So, service revenues, as it continues to grow and be a big part of our business, it\u2019s actually dilutive to our gross margin and accretive on our operating income line. So, we have really tried to look at kind of the whole picture how we improve margins. So, there are things underway and operating efficiencies to be able to improve gross margin, but there are a lot of pushes and falls and we are guiding to a 58.5% to 59% and we will be working to see if there are other opportunities to improve that, but mix kind of shakes out during the course of the year.","Doug Schenkel","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And next we have Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Puneet Souda","Yes, hi, Chris. Thanks for taking my questions. So I am trying to understand a bit better on the recurring revenue growth. So, you delivered obviously it\u2019s only in the quarter. I was just trying to understand the underlying dynamics, is it related to some of the more product lines, is it a more Glycan kits or columns versus the service contract uptake? Would be helpful if you could just elaborate a bit and give us a sense of sustainability of that in 2018 knowing the pharma uncertainties that you have talked about?","ChrisO\u2019Connell","Yes, thanks, Puneet, I appreciate the question. I think the underlying dynamics in the recurring lines were pretty consistent with historical performance. We definitely continue to drive service plan up and certainly we see growth opportunity particularly in the emerging markets where there has been more installed base build out and where more products are still under warranty as those products come off service plan opportunities come on. And so we have opportunities just to continue that slow steady march upward in terms of attach rates on service plans and they are pretty high and pretty stable in the developed markets and there is opportunity for growth in the emerging markets. We also continue to add to our portfolio and professional service offerings and these are the more consultative type of programs that are more informatics driven that customers find incredibly valuable. As it relates to the chemistries it\u2019s really a little bit of both what you mentioned. The core column business is very solid, very solid aftermarket that reflects the high utilization of our systems, but also kind of a gradually improving mix based on the growth of UPLC methods. And as you know UPLC columns tend to be sold at a little more of a premium and we have a higher attach rate on our UPLC platforms than our HPLC platforms. And also the kits Glycan measurement is clearly a great area of interest among a lot of our customers and that plus also protein works and in other offerings we have in that area and we think that it\u2019s a smaller business for us right now in terms of these kits, but one that we think has good growth potential on a pretty sustainable basis.","Puneet Souda","Okay. Thanks for that. And one follow-up in terms of you have obviously highlighted in past that smaller accounts and biotechs have become increasingly bigger part of the revenue at Waters over the years and could you give us your sense of sustainability of that over than next year knowing that there is the tax reform driven M&A potentially here and obviously I mean I agree the point that you don\u2019t have the M&A crystal ball neither do we. So I am just trying to understand how to think about if those mid to small sized biotech accounts will continue to become a bigger part of Waters or become consolidated? Thanks.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes. I guess like I said earlier Puneet, I don\u2019t really have that crystal ball and probably not the best predictor of what might happen in consolidation. All I can share is the experience I have is I go out into the marketplace myself and as our teams work every day. And that\u2019s that there is a broadening base of customers. And there has been a lot of activity at the startup and midsize level as it relates to our business. Many of those companies that I speak with are looking to build bigger franchises over time. They are going after multiple targets. And to the extent some of those companies are more U.S. oriented that gives them some benefit from tax reform as it relates to their own profitability after tax. Again, we \u2013 I would try to gauge the overall inventive and volume related dynamics for the industry at large, almost regardless of who is actually driving that. And we certainly see the big companies driving innovation. We certainly see the small companies driving innovation. And we like that balance that ultimately produces in our business. So it\u2019s a dynamic marketplace and we will just have to what you play out and see where the opportunities are.","Puneet Souda","Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.","Chris O\u2019Connell","I think we have time for about two more questions here before we run out of the top of the hour.","Operator","Okay. Our next question will be from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thank you. Good morning, I want to ask about new products, you mentioned that growing testing needs for large molecule, could you give us an update on BioTOF and do you think that could be a contributor in 2018?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure, yes. Let me give you quick comment on product and we remind you of my typical answer and that\u2019s that new branding products are really important, but also the new technology that\u2019s in the market is really what\u2019s driving our business clearly in the last 2 years, 3 years, 4 years we have had some great entrants across the board from QD arc to QDA to TQS Micro, TQXS, the discovery series in TA. And we are really keying on a lot of those technologies along with legacy acuity and legacy alliance and all the associated chemistries. In \u201818 we have a number of platform enhancements that are coming out that don\u2019t sound like big fancy new products, but are really important in terms of enhancing the overall application success of our customers. And then BioTOF continues to move well through development. I don\u2019t want to put a specific timeline on the launch, but I am very excited about this program to provide more of an off-the-shelf solution for about molecule characterization that we believe can work its way right into the heart of the routine and regulated workflows first in development than in QA QC. We think there is a lot of demand in the market for it and all I will say is that the product development teams are working very hard and making very good progress. And I anticipate that as we move through the year, I will be able to give you a better sense as to when the market might see that.","Jack Meehan","Great. Looking forward to it. And then just one on the quarter, you mentioned some of the India GST disruption came back, is that fully worked through the system now and maybe just where did that contribute in the quarter?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes. So, India as you know had a \u2013 we had a decline in Q3 as we had some delays with GST. It\u2019s a complex process of harmonization in terms of both state and national transaction taxes. We did make good progress. One of the things to note though is that the laws around GST are still evolving and that system catch-up that I have talked about before is I think doing well, but still not out of the woods yet and so we think that this as we have said before that the full catch-up process takes more than a quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s fully back to normal yet, but I think we are probably through the toughest pieces of it and we are supporting our India team with everything we have as company to keep everything moving while we get through it, but there really \u2013 there wasn\u2019t any loss in demand through the process it was just more of a transition to work through and we are excited about our India business.","Jack Meehan","Thanks, Chris.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Okay. I think we are one more here.","Operator","Alright. Our last question will come from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, guys. Good morning. So maybe just on China, can you just give me a view on sort of how you are thinking about the cadence obviously it\u2019s been strong all year and I am more interested in sort of dividing it into kind of the emerging biopharma and generic customers versus sort of some of the more traditional parts of industrial that you touch?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure. Yes, thanks for the question on China, Ross, as you know I am excited about China, I was excited about China for my whole career in medical devices and now here at Waters and I think there is just a lot of interesting things going on in that economy as China really moves towards a local innovation economy. Our China business as I have commented before is actually more balanced than most of our major geographies in fact, while 60% of our worldwide revenue is in pharma, only about 50% or even a little less of the business in China is related to pharma, but there is a broad as you suggest a broad backdrop of industrial business of food being over-indexed in China and also the material science business there. I guess I feel like what we are trying to do is to key off some of the major government initiatives, obviously, a lot of the focus now has been on some of the evolution in pharma, there is significant investment in local companies seeking to serve the Chinese market on the small molecule side, but also on biosimilars, I just was in China in mid-December and one night sat down with 10 CEOs of biosimilar companies that were all Chinese biosimilar companies serving the local market and I can\u2019t quite quantify what that exactly means, but I do see a lot of drive for innovation and a lot of optimism that those markets are there and that the government is going to support those therapies as come to patients. There are some broader things going on in China too around one belt, one road around healthy China 2030 and other key initiatives that we are just making sure that we are providing the type of technologies in service, but that companies in China need to take advantage of those trends. So, there is definitely a tilt towards some localization there and we are looking at strategies as to how we continue to localize, but overall we are just trying to maintain that balance in that growth and make sure we feed the eagles in China with the right investments, so that they can continue to grow and perform.","Ross Muken","That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just to close things out, so as we think about \u201818 forecast. This is business pretty predictable, lot of recurring revenue, I guess variability tends to come on the instrument line, if you are thinking about sort of the key sub-segments whether it would be geographic product or end market that is likely to sort of drive maybe a differentiated view versus your original forecast, where do you see the most likely sort of volatility or maybe variability and kind of the assumptions and what markets maybe you have the best sort of inclination versus maybe is there anything, it seems like everything is so positive where you see a little bit of caution?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes, I think that\u2019s a crystal ball type question that I would hesitate to put too fine a point on. Obviously, there are different dynamics as it relates to comps, tougher comps and easier comps in various quarters by various geographies and the math is fairly clear there, but I guess the thing that I am assuming and I feel good about is the balance across geographies backed by some reasonable assumptions in the overall global economy and balance across our customer-defined end markets that we saw this year. I mean, if you look at 2017 overall we got 7% out of pharma, 5% out of industrial and 6% out of government and academic. And while those numbers are not completely similar to historic numbers, they do underscore the balance that we see in our business right now. So balance, balance, balance is what we strive for and we will obviously build plans to address unforeseen circumstances as they come up, but just keep our eye on the ball as it relates to delivering this year, but also investing in things that are exciting and will lead to sustainable growth for the future.","Chris O\u2019Connell","So, anyway with that, I think we need to wrap up. We are a little over the hour and I do want to thank all of you for your great questions. Concluding now, we are pleased with our fourth quarter as I mentioned and our full year results for 2017 and it was headlined by our ability to deliver consistently strong organic revenue growth combined with disciplined P&L management to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth. As we move into 2018, we remain focused on execution and feel that market conditions combined with our strong competitive position support continued success. So, on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you for your support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q1 2018 call, which we currently anticipate holding on April 24, 2018. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Lynch - Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. Well, good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding the future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full year 2016.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and in the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.","In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, at this time, generally adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.","Lastly, as you recall in January, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments Division. So, today on this call and into the future, we will now refer to the Waters products and markets and TA Instruments products and markets.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Also here for our commentary and Q&A is Gene Cassis, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. Since delivering results is our first priority, I will begin my comments with highlights from our first fiscal quarter of 2016.","Overall, I was pleased with our execution in the first quarter as the results largely materialized as we expected. Five percent revenue growth was at the high end of our guidance which is encouraging to me when you consider that sales in the prior year's first quarter were up 15% making for a challenging base of comparison as we entered 2016. Sales strength in our pharmaceutical end market, impressive growth from our recurring-revenue products, and continuing double-digit increases in China and India are all continuations of positive multiple-quarter trends in these key growth drivers.","Taking a closer look at our business by major end markets. The highlight was the 9% growth of our broadly defined pharmaceutical market for Waters products. The growth in this market was most pronounced in regulated testing markets such as quality assurance and quality control testing. As we have seen for about the last two years, the strength of our pharmaceutical revenue was broad-based and highlighted by growth in smaller firms, specialty, and generic customers.","Our global Waters industrial business, which includes food, environmental, and chemical materials markets, was flat in the quarter, with growth in overseas markets offsetting a decline in the U.S. Within this market, underlying demand for food quality and safety applications was strong in certain regions. And the decline in the U.S. is principally related to tough comparisons with last year.","Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a slight decline of about 1%, with strong shipments of research LC\/MS systems in China, offset by declines in U.S. and European institutions against a strong first quarter in 2015.","Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter. Waters Instrument sales grew 2%, weighted towards workhorse chromatography systems used for routine pharmaceutical testing applications. We are seeing significant traction for our newly introduced ACQUITY Arc System and continued growth for ACQUITY QDa mass detection on new systems, as well as through upgrades to existing systems.","On the research mass spectrometry side, we began regular shipments of Vion IMS QTof in the quarter. Waters' recurring revenues, the combination of service and consumables led our product categories in the quarter posting 8% growth in comparison to a strong prior year's result and with one fewer selling day. Waters' service and support business grew at a 7% rate with performance geographically broad-based and primarily associated with a strong uptake in contracted plans. Consumables 8% growth was largely balanced across major geographical regions with continued strong underlying demand for ACQUITY UPLC columns.","In addition, we continue to see positive reception of our application specific preanalytic kits such as the GlycoWorks RapiFluor-MS labeling and our newly released ProteinWorks kits. Overall, the robust growth of our recurring line is indicative of our strong market share position, a growing installed base of our systems and strong instrument utilization rates.","In our thermal analysis and rheology products from TA Instruments, business in the quarter was flat in comparison to a strong first quarter in 2015. We made a decision to launch the new Discovery line of thermal analyzers at this year's Pittsburgh conference which had the effect of delaying orders and shipments of current systems in the quarter, but sets up a stronger overall opportunity over the course of 2016. Featuring new instruments for DSC or Differential Scanning Calorimetry and TGA or thermogravimetric analysis, this new product line represents a step function improvement and performance in utility for TA's core business.","Interest in these new platforms was high at Pittcon with a strong pipeline of new orders building in recent weeks. We expect the new Discovery system business will benefit growth in the second quarter and help support another year of strong sales growth and profitability for TA.","Geographically, we saw a decent balance with modest growth in the developed markets and strong growth in key emerging markets. In the Americas region, the U.S. delivered 2% growth led by low teens growth from the U.S. pharmaceutical market in the quarter. U.S. industrial sales were affected by strong quarterly comparison as well as TA's Discovery system launch. We expect government and academic sales to ramp later this year as budgets get released.","In Europe, we saw a similar 2% sales increase with balanced mid-single-digit pharmaceutical and industrial growth offset by lower governmental and academic shipments. Our most significant geographic growth in the quarter came from Asia, which posted an 11% growth rate with strong demand from China and India.","Sales in China, our largest Asian market, were up mid-teens with balanced sales growth across all major end markets. We are very encouraged by the strong and steady business momentum that we have seen in China in recent quarters.","I also continue to be impressed with the growth of our business in India where continued strong generic drug testing business drove a high teens sales growth performance. And not to be overshadowed, sales in Japan were also up in the high-single digits with double-digit pharmaceutical growth and general stability in other end markets.","Before I turn the call over to Gene for more financial detail, I'd like to share my broader thoughts on our progress. I feel we're off to a good start this year with solid revenue performance against a tough Q1 2015 comparison and strength in our core business drivers.","Looking beyond the revenue line, I was very pleased with our team's execution on the P&L. We managed our expenses well in the first quarter, generated very strong free cash flow and continue to deploy capital conservatively, primarily towards internal innovation as well as our well-established share repurchase program.","While first quarter results in the past have not necessarily been a reliable indication of how the full year will play out, at this point, we are encouraged about our 2016 prospects based on our belief in the sustainability of Q1's growth drivers, as well as our expectation for an increasing balance of end market demand over the course of the year.","At the same time, we are also investing in future growth opportunities. One of my top personal priorities is to stay close to the science and technology, and to ensure that we maintain a robust pipeline of new instrument, applications and research programs.","Related to my focus on innovation, I have continued to travel extensively, visiting a wide range of customers across our market segments so that I can gain an even deeper sense for their needs and how we should invest towards better solutions. Since I started in September, I have visited well over 50 customers in 20 cities on three continents. This process has been energizing, and has given me an increasing appreciation for the unique quality of our field teams, and the growth opportunities ahead of us.","Finally, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our leadership team. We delivered a solid quarter while also transitioning to our new globally integrated organizational structure. I am very pleased with the pace of the team in seizing opportunities to capitalize on our unique competitive advantages.","Now, I'd like to pass the call to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the first quarter, our revenues came in at $475 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 2 percentage points, resulting in reported sales growth of 3%.","Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the first quarter were up 4% to $1.26 in comparison to earnings of $1.21 last year.","On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.15 and consistent with the $1.15 that we delivered last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced first quarter earnings by about $0.08 and without this negative impact, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have grown by about 11%.","Importantly in the quarter, and as Chris had mentioned, sales to our broadly defined biopharmaceutical markets grew about 9%. Geographically, the strength of this important segment was broad-based, with the U.S. up 13%, Europe up 5% and Asian markets growing at double-digit rates.","On the product front, Waters' sales were up 5% while TA sales were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrument system sales increased by 2% and TA instrumentation sales declined slightly in the quarter and were down 3%.","Our total recurring revenues associated with Waters and TA products grew by 8%, with TA service revenue up 9%.","Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and before foreign currency translation, U.S. sales were up 2%, Europe also up 2%, Japan was up 8% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%. Sales of Waters' products were strong in China and up 13%. TA product sales were generally stronger in Asia, offset by declines in the United States and Europe.","Now, I would like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in about as expected, at 57.7%, with a moderate currency headwind.","Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis, and were flat on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew about 4% in the quarter, and on a constant currency basis, were up 2%, primarily as a result of a weaker British pound. On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 82 million shares or approximately 1.8 million shares lower than in the first quarter last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short term investments totaled $2.5 billion and debt totaled $1.7 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $786 million. As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 745,000 shares of our common stock for $90 million. This leaves $351 million on our authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the first quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $141 million after funding $25 million of capital. Excluded from this capital spending is approximately $3 million of investments associated with major facility expansion. Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 84 days this quarter. Inventories increased by $24 million in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting the typical seasonal patterns.","Now, I will discuss our full-year 2016 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes a continued strong biopharmaceutical end market, relatively balanced performance across our instrumentation lines; and we feel that these dynamics will support a mid-single-digit constant-currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to be about neutral to sales growth.","Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by a modest full-year negative FX dynamic. We expect to manage our operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our sales growth rate. Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million.","We currently expect our full-year operating tax rate to come in at between 13% and 14%. Looking at share buybacks, we plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average diluted share count of about 81 million shares outstanding.","Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2016 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $6.20 and $6.40. Looking at the second quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a rate between 5% and 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to be about neutral to sales growth in the quarter.","Rolling these factors together, we expect our adjusted second quarter's earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.48. And with that, I'll turn you back to Chris.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thank you, Gene. And with that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone's question. So, please limit yourself to only one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. And after the Q&A, I will add a few closing comments.","Operator, first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Melena, and congratulations on a solid quarter. So, just two quick questions from me. First, can you, Chris, as you've gotten to know the business a little bit more. I mean, what strikes in the quarter is the strength of recurring revenues, particularly because I think you had one less selling day in the quarter? So, maybe if you could just talk about what you saw there? Is that being impacted by pricing at all? Is there anything that's happening from a pricing standpoint on the services or the consumable side?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure, Jon. Thank you. And yeah, the strength of the recurring business is certainly a highlight for us and something we watch very closely. And as I said in my comments, I think it's a function of a variety of factors including our strong position in instruments and our growing installed base but also our ability to not only hang on to but enhance our contracted service plans.","And your point on price is also correct that we do seek over time to maintain or even enhance our pricing power for these recurring lines on service and on chemistry consumables. And on the consumable side, we are benefiting from a continued uptick of our UPLC systems and higher attachment rates that we get on those chemistries which is a nice natural tailwind for us in addition to some of the application specific kits that I mentioned early and we're very excited about GlycoWorks and ProteinWorks and other things in our pipeline. So, this has been a nice source of growth for us. It's gradually increasing. It's a mix of our overall portfolio and has favorable economics that go along with it. So, it is a top priority for us.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just quickly. I don't know either Chris or Gene, there has been some comments around Ireland looking to change how it looks at the tax rate that it offers companies there? I think you renegotiated Singapore but I'm just kind of curious what your outlook is for tax in Ireland and just tax, in general, if there's anything you're seeing there that we need to be aware of? Thanks.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Well, this is Gene, Jon. Thank you for the question and we carefully monitor changes in governmental tax policies around the world especially those that impact our company directly. And you're right that between Singapore, Ireland and the UK, they're all very meaningful to us along with the United States. But at this time, we're not anticipating any change in our situation in Ireland. The effective tax rate that we enjoy there is in the 11% or 12% range and as we look at the guidance for this year and look at the long-term outlook for the company at this time, we're continuing to use that rate.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","You're welcome.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys. Thank you. I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit about the competitive environment, you had obviously a really strong comp to work against this quarter and curious if you felt like you were able to take a little bit of market share in any of the key product areas.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks, Isaac. I appreciate the question. As you know, measuring market share on a quarter-by-quarter basis in this business is a little bit challenging and so in order to assess how we're performing competitively, I tend to look at \u2013 I've looked at a lot of data on more of a rolling basis. And market share is critically important. We do want to win in all of our major categories and I think looking at our growth rate in instruments, looking at our growth rate in chemistries and service and some of the different product categories, we do believe we've grown at a rate that exceeds the market. And so, we do believe that in the core LC business, we are gradually picking up some market share and that's our goal and we need to continue to feed that with innovation which is our primary lever.","On the mass spec side, it's a little bit different by product category. While we've been under some pressure on the higher end research mass spec, we have performed in a solid way in the tandem quad business and particularly the new category of the QDa, have been a nice \u2013 a gainer for us. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag there, but we continue to really focus and prioritize our execution in making sure we're maintaining and enhancing that market share position.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Chris. And just a follow-up, the guidance for 2Q that you gave us was relatively in line with what I was looking for, but I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about operating leverage in the business? You mentioned the importance of the good expense control in the first quarter, and if we look at the top-line profile of mid- to high-single digits on organic growth rates, the bottom-line growth, historically in this business has been \u2013 has shown pretty good leverage, and I'm wondering how you think about that this year as you put your plan more into place.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure. No, happy to address that, Isaac. Thanks. You know obviously, as you know, the last three years, as I look back over the last two to three years, I think there's been good operating leverage masked by FX, of course, and the challenges we face there. And so, as we look at 2016 is a little more of a transition year as it relates to FX, we are trying to balance that growth and the investment in the portfolio, obviously with a good top line over the last year, and continuing to push the top line, we want to make sure we're feeding that growth with the right levels of investment.","And so as we look across the balance of the year, I think our revenue outlook is balanced in terms of over the course of the year, each of the end markets harmonizing more to our guidance range. And we have an investment plan over the course of the year that is designed to yield some very modest leverage, obviously, with top-line performance, if top-line performance exceeds our stated guidance, there is some potential for some additional leverage. But obviously, over the course of time, I do feel that leverage is possible in this business based on the mix and the evolving mix of our business particularly towards service and consumables. The fact that we operate in very attractive market segments and the opportunities for scale up and down the P&L as we grow. So, that's really our approach. But overall, it is a balanced approach because, as I mentioned in my comments, feeding the growth is critical particularly on the innovation side.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Appreciate all that color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Maybe first on government academic. I know you had a difficult comp this quarter, as you did last quarter. Just wondering when you think you may see things pick up a little bit both in the U.S. and Europe, I know you talked about being a little soft as well.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure, Tycho. I'll make a quick comment, and maybe Gene wants to add to it. But the government and academic in general has been, as I look at this business, more of a back-half factor with lumpier performance in the first half of the year, and I think that's our continued expectations, particularly as some of the new budget gets released through the NIH funding that we've watched closely. And so, we've been relatively conservative on our assumptions in the first half of the year and expect that to be more of a back-half phenomenon.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Yeah.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And...","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Just to add, I think Chris did a very good job explaining the situation. I would just add that historically, our participation in those non-profit market segments has been weighted towards our higher end-mass spectrometry offerings. And as we go through this year, we will continue to see a ramp of our Vion instrument as well as some pretty exciting new product introduction plans at the upcoming ASMS meeting. So, I think we're encouraged at the prospects and we have a pretty good pipeline as we look at the remaining quarters of 2016, Tycho.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just maybe following up on Isaac's question earlier about leverage. Chris, one of the things you've been vocal about is maybe showing more discipline on the R&D spending and kind of rethinking maybe the way you approach R&D. Can you just talk a little bit about how you think about implementing some of those changes around systems engineering and maybe realigning some of the R&D priorities?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure. It is a very high priority as I mentioned. Thanks for the question. And I'm still in my process of learning all about how we create value through that innovation process. And as I have been vocal about \u2013 remained very, very committed to our position, I believe, in the industry as the most vital organic innovator. And in doing that, the question of R&D productivity is vital. The company has made great strides in recent years on sort of the portfolio approach. And certainly, some of the organization evolution that I've been leading is really designed to get after that responsive, more integrated product portfolio.","One thing I've tried to take a look at, because there is so much innovation, is a crisper definition of the difference between what's in our product development pipeline and maybe what's in our research pipeline. And the good news is, there's a lot happening on both scores. Just to make sure that we get increased visibility as to our near-term pipeline, but also we're making the right bets to ensure bigger innovations down the road.","As part of that, and looking at both the combination of our Instruments or LC and our MS Instruments, as well as our applied technologies, certainly, the market does appear to be tilting towards an increasing appreciation for the strength we bring across all of those categories and the more integrated view of our product portfolio and so, that's certainly feedback I've heard from many customers and the dialogue internally and I think the team's making great progress.","I also want to comment on TA, because some of what I just mentioned in terms of the instruments refer to the Waters products but on the TA side, the Discovery series that I mentioned in the call has been long coming. It's beginning to show its promise in the marketplace and while TA has also benefited from some modest tuck-in M&A over the past, I think this cycle of innovation's going to make a big difference as well.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just one clarification the $3 million in facility expansion that was called out, is that at all tied to the Health Science initiative? I know you've talked about new manufacturing to meet medical device requirements. I'm just wondering if that feeds into that.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Hi. Tycho, it's Gene. That is more tied to an updating of our headquarters facility here in Milford. We've had a plan over the last two or three years to try to use space more efficiently at this campus and that's a continuing effort.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Good morning.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Morning.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, a couple of questions. So, I'm curious about the gross margin. You noted that strength in the instrument business was in the workhorse chromatography, so I assume that's Alliance which I believe is a relatively high margin product, and then you had a high consumables mix this quarter. The gross margin was a little bit lower than where I thought it was going to come in. So, could you sort of walk through the dynamics on what was going in, the give and takes?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure, Derik. Maybe I'll make a quick comment, and Gene can add to it as well. When we think about the gross margin, obviously, at the very top of it is our ability to maintain price. And that came up earlier in the call. And so, certainly our pricing was strong in the quarter, particularly around our recurring revenues.","And, really, what you refer to as a positive mix was offset by some currency headwind, as \u2013 pretty much as we expected, but volumes and factors like absorption were very much in line. So, this gross margin was actually very much in line with what we expected and should correlate pretty well to the expectations we've laid out for the rest of the year.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Hi, Derik. This is Gene. I mean, one of the things on the gross margin side is that the first quarter of 2015 was kind of a hard quarter to replicate. At the end of the (32:17) year last year, we had gross margins that were around 59%, and that's what we delivered in the first quarter last year. And historically, our high-margin quarters are later in the calendar year as we do a better job absorbing some of our fixed expenses.","On the gross margin side, as well as almost in every attribute, the first quarter of 2015 was a little bit of a point off the line. I think that the 58-ish percent gross margin that we delivered in the first quarter is consistent with a full-year outlook that would bring you up to 59% for the full year, with stronger gross margins anticipated in the fourth quarter.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And just one quick follow-up, you did mention currencies, obviously, Japan's rebounded off of what was some doldrums last year, and the yen's rebounded. Can you sort of talk about Japan, and sort of like the yen pull-through? Thanks.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Oh, yeah. Just so you know that in the guidance that we gave, we were looking at a yen of about \u00a5109. It's a little bit higher than that today. We had a strong quarter in Japan, with Japan up 8% in the first quarter. So, certainly that is a little bit of a tailwind for us as we look at FX dynamics moving through the year.","On the other hand, we have some secondary currencies that have been a headwind for us. And those currencies are in countries where the business tends to be a little bit lumpy. So, there's a little bit of conservatism in our forecast, anticipating that the tailwind that we get from the stronger yen could potentially be largely offset by some continuing headwind from some of these secondary currencies. But, frankly, it's a hard thing to call.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","You're very welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. One, my first question is actually on China. Really strong balanced trends there. It seems like coming in to 2016, Waters and perhaps others had pretty strong backlogs in China. Could you speak to the relationship here between new order growth and revenue growth in China?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. Steve, I think that's probably a level of detail that we don't really want to get into too much. And obviously our whole goal is to make sure that our sales growth is balanced over time with our orders growth. And there is a longer pipeline in China than in other geographies for a variety of reasons, but I think on the whole, the results that we're reporting here on the sales line reflect what's happening on the underlying order side as well.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then just one follow-up on the pharma business. Could you speak to how you're seeing growth evolving this year, specifically in small pharma and biotech? I heard a comment on the strength in the prepared remarks, but I wonder if you could compare and contrast it to what you saw, maybe second half 2015? Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. No, thanks. I think the trends, Steve, are pretty similar to what we saw over the course of 2015 and particularly in the back half, and that is a reflection of the greater diversification of the pharmaceutical customer base, both within these categories of traditional large multinational pharma, but also biotech, generic, specialty, et cetera. In fact, just as a point of reference, if you look at our top accounts, our larger traditional accounts, they grew more in the low- to mid-single-digit range versus the bigger parts of our growth which came from some of those other pools.","And it's not just a company diversification, if you will, or a customer diversification, there's also geographic diversification. For example in the generic business, there is a very strong presence in India, as well as different parts of Europe, and even a visit I had in Canada, where there is a tremendous amount of innovation and growth and scale in that generics category and even some green shoots in the biosimilars category.","So, it continues to impress me as I get out to see customers that some of the old divisions maybe, between who you'd expect to be developing small molecule drugs and larger molecule drugs, those lines are blurring. And the level of competitive intensity is high in that field, the level of innovation is high, but it's a more balanced approach. So, we obviously watch this closely. I'm continuing to try to get even more deeper, more granular understanding as to the dynamics and the sustainability of this market, but it does appear to be a very different market than what it's been in the past.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","No question. Thanks, Chris.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. So, I'd love a little bit more color on sort of the generic pharma emerging markets CRO demand front. We've seen, on the generic side, pricing destabilize here the last three or six months. So, I'm curious with some of the vendors struggling a bit, how you think about that at least from a CapEx perspective? Obviously on a units perspective, it doesn't really influence the recurring revenues much.","And then, specific to maybe India and then sort of the CROs, with some of the currency volatility and then, in general, some of the struggles they've had on the FDA side. Again, how are you thinking more on the CapEx side of demand there? It seems like the business has been pretty resilient despite all the noise?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. No, Ross, I think that's a good word, resilient, in terms of how this market appears. And again, I'm pretty new in understanding this and spent time in some of these markets to understand exactly your question.","At the end of the day, there is some competitive volatility in that market, and I've certainly had the chance to learn about different facets of that, whether they're American companies participating there or Indian companies, or Canadian companies, et cetera. But at the end of the day, if the pill count is rising, and the underlying operational activity is there, which it certainly is, then that's going to translate into that resiliency or that stability in the end market. Obviously, as you point out, the regulatory bar continues to rise for generic drug manufacturers particularly those serving the United States who are operating outside the United States and some of our competitive advantages in terms of our informatics are in power, chromatography data systems, for example. And what we've been able to supplement on the service side in terms of helping companies through their growth to meet regulatory compliance has all been positive factors in our device utilization.","Our market share tends to be pretty high in some of these methods and in some of these markets and we don't take that for granted. We fight for it every day, but we continue to see this as a good opportunity for growth and by the way, that's resulting in some very positive things for the healthcare system overall and greater patient access to medications and therapies. So, it's good business.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And how are you thinking about where you're going with gross leverage over time. I mean, obviously, Waters has had sort of a trapped cash issue like many and you've obviously solved it via borrowing and then being able to continue to repurchase stock. I think we're pushing at some point two-and-a-half times on the gross side, I mean, where do you think that can go comfortably and then does it make you think differently since you've been there a bit about M&A, ex-U.S. in terms of unlocking some of that trapped cash overseas?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. It's an important question. Obviously, we watch this closely and I'm devoting my energies over time and my CEO voice to responsible tax reform so, that we can have policies that allow us to utilize our cash better globally and to strengthen our country and our economy and that's the important message for all of us.","But we think this is a very manageable situation. We do have capacity in the leverage metrics that you identified. And I don't see this issue compelling us to a different M&A strategy than we have. I mean my view on M&A strategy is very clear which M&A is a tactic for us that would be utilized for the appropriate business strategy if we see the right opportunity that can make us better and stronger and enhance the value of our products for our customers in our chosen markets. We'll do M&A but it's secondary to our internal innovation program and certainly not driven by balance sheet factors like you mentioned.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. My first question is I was hoping you could help us work through the components of the EPS guidance change for the year. You increased EPS guidance for the year by $0.075 at the midpoint. I estimate that you get about $0.05 from tax and interest expense changes. FX seems to be about $0.08 to $0.12. So, it seems like there has to be some offset here. You didn't increase constant-currency revenue growth expectations for the year. So, is the offset here all increased operating expenses?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Yeah. I'll comment on that. I think your first observation, Doug, is accurate that obviously, the FX environment has changed. We started the year anticipating that the FX headwind in terms of our number of cents on EPS would be $0.15 or $0.16. And we saw around $0.08 of that in the first quarter. We're anticipating that that would be the lion's share of the FX headwind that we encounter for the full year. And I think as you correctly noted that there is an expectation that the amount of operating leverage that we get for the full year will not be the same level of operating leverage that we delivered in the first quarter. We do know that we have expenses coming as we go into the second and third quarter associated with what we hope to be very exciting new product launches. There'll be more material expenses, there'll be more marketing expenses associated with that.","And if you do a rough calculation, you'd see that our full year EPS guide doesn't really have baked into it the 200 basis points of leverage that we delivered in the first quarter on an organic constant currency basis but much more moderate. So, there is an anticipation that operating expenses will increase as we move through the year and the basis of this increase is primarily new product launches that are planned as we move through the year.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. But just to be clear, did you increase your plans for operating spends relative to where you were at the beginning of the year or are expectations the same today as they were three months ago?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Well, the expectations are roughly the same, Doug. It's just that we were a little bit more efficient on the expense side in the first quarter than we anticipated originally and we benefited from that in the first quarter's results. But our expectation is that we will execute on the plan as articulated on the last earnings call.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And my second question is just related to TA sales. You noted that they stalled a bit due to the introduction of new products. Any chance you would quantify and relatedly maybe provide backlog data as a way to frame underlying demand? Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","I think we probably stop short of providing that kind of information, just to embellish a little bit on my comments, Doug. We did make a very calculated decision during the middle of the quarter when we saw some of the strength in some of our other sectors like pharmaceuticals to take advantage of the platform we had at Pittcon, which is an important meeting to talk more openly about our pipeline there. And in terms of the effect on TA, it was material to TA, but I think balancing the small hit we took in Q1 on TA is a encouraging set of quoting activity, demoing activity, and ordering activity that will begin to show later in the second quarter. But I'd stop short of providing backlog data other than to say our overall year, we probably have a higher confidence in TA based on the actions we took in Q1.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Good morning. So, India has now had strong quarters for the past eight quarters. That's, of course, after a prolonged period of weakness. How much longer can India keep up that strong growth? How much pent-up demand is there in the market?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Good question, Bryan. I wish I had a great answer to that, and I hope there is quite a bit more. Obviously, we \u2013 like I said earlier in the comments on the generic market which is driving this \u2013 the signs are for continued stability in that market and obviously there's other factors in India which have occurred over time like currency shocks and things that effect local companies and those dynamics that you can sometimes never exactly predict.","And so, you can't ever be too sure, but we're just heads down focused. We've got a very strong experienced team in India that enjoys very high market share in those chromatography systems. We're obviously trying to invest in new growth engines, as well, to balance that over time. The food safety market happens to be one example there in India that we're interested in. But I'm encouraged by what I see as a broader trend in pharmaceuticals towards the generic marketplace and the global nature of that, that hopefully will support continued strong growth in that segment for us.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And for the overall biopharma market, did you \u2013 was the strength consistent throughout the quarter? Did you start to see any tapering as you close out the quarter?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","No. I don't think there's any particularly noteworthy trends one way or another during the quarter.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Sara M. Silverman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. This is Sara Silverman on for Tim. I just wanted to ask you kind of a broader question, Chris. With another quarter under your belt, do you have a better feel for any adjustments you could foresee making to Waters' overall strategy that you could share with us?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","No. That's a fair question. And I guess, I'm continuing in a process, Sara, I'd say of continuing to assess the company and obviously these customer interactions and my knowledge of the marketplace grows as each quarter goes by. From a high-level standpoint, I'm encouraged by the fact that the markets that we participate in are quite attractive. Of course, they're going to have their various cycles but over the long term, I do see these as attractive markets and I really am gaining a deeper and deeper appreciation and everything I've learned reinforces the unique position we have in the industry in terms of our focus and our record and our desire to produce industry-leading organic innovation.","My first priority as I go through this is to really put a lot of definition around our core business and job one in strategy is always make sure you're maximizing your performance and potential in your core business and we love our core and we'll continue to seek first to optimize that.","Beyond that, it's really a matter of gaining more and more clarity on where we should see upside growth opportunities in terms of some of the growing markets, new markets, and even geographic markets and I think some of the themes we've talked about even in some of these calls reinforce what those are. At the end of the day, we are taking a pretty deep and structured and thoughtful approach to this planning process and I'm energized, the organization's energized and what I expect to be able to report on in the future is just higher degrees of clarity on priorities around the markets, our chosen markets that we're serving, our product plan and the capabilities that we want to develop in the organization to get there.","So, I don't think I've seen anything that pulls me off of my view of this business and the potential of the business. I'm very excited about the potential for Waters and making a big difference in the world and continuing on our focused innovation pathway.","Sara M. Silverman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And just one quick question, back to the strength in Japan, could you tell us a little more about what the drivers were there? And how sustainable you think that is?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Sure. Japan is a great market for us. It's a big market for us. And in fact, I had the opportunity to visit Japan since we've spoken last. And what I saw there was a team with just tremendous focus and really kind of zoning in on some, I think, some good market share opportunities in LC, principally behind our Empower Chromatography Data System platform and a lot of those regulatory factors that are important to those customers.","I also see an opportunity in the triple quad business where we have a little bit of a lower share but some newer products and also some market opportunity. The growth in the quarter there was broad based, as we pointed out. Pharma, in particular, was strong, had maybe a little easier comparison but had good year-over-year growth. And \u2013 but the end markets there were reasonable.","So, Japan, historically, has been more of a developed market, more mid-single-digit type growth, low- to mid-single-digit type growth. And so, when we get a quarter like this out of Japan, we're excited. I don't necessarily expect that type of growth rate to be the permanent growth rate in Japan but we do expect to be very competitive in that market and we've got a great team there.","Sara M. Silverman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Chris, if you just strip out the impact of new products on TA, can you comment on how you're feeling about the outlook for the industrial markets right now? It would be helpful to just get some color on the different segments of the customer base there in terms of environmental, chemical, food, et cetera.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, overall, the industrial markets \u2013 there is pressure on these end markets, as you know, from just studying the general economy. The comps were a little tougher in the first quarter, get a little bit easier over the course of the year, generally. And obviously, one of the big factors in our overall industrial outlook is the DSC and the TGA. In particular, the level of performance around sensitivity and resolution of those DSC and TGA products is going to impact a number of their end markets, particularly, for example, high-performance industrial polymer markets, aerospace, semiconductors, some of those types of markets.","But I think another market that is beyond the traditional thermal analysis market in TA that's pretty interesting to us is rheology. I've actually spent some time getting to know some players in the rheology segment of the market and am pretty encouraged by the breadth of that opportunity, and particularly as we further integrate some of our new technology that we picked up through acquisition in rubber rheology.","So, TA is a business that's characterized by a very broad customer base, smaller deal sizes. And while they are obviously heavily entrenched and tied to the industrial markets, we do, obviously, try to subset that market effectively and make sure we're pouring resources into some of those areas that we think can give us growth.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then, if I just think about the comment on growth in the regulated markets, are you able to sort of talk to the pace of transition of customers from HPLC to UPLC at this point? I'm just curious whether that conversion rate there is more or less steady state or whether that's picked up for one reason or another.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. That's something I'm trying to understand, Dan, as well. And from my perspective, it's a relatively steady transition, and Gene may want to add more on this. It's one of the reasons that we are so excited about our ACQUITY Arc platform as kind of a bridging technology to try to enhance that transition over time. We fully recognize that there's a large world of HPLC out there that we need to continue to serve well, particularly around some of the more routine testing. But over time, we I think are doing a better and better job of selling the benefits of UPLC technology and providing our customers more pathways to get there. So, hopefully that's a trend that we can continue to rely on. I don't know, Gene, if you want to add to that?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President - Business Development and Investor Relations","Yeah, Dan. I would agree with everything that Chris said. And just remind everyone that UPLC is a fundamental chemistry technology, and that one of the best ways to look at the conversion or the adoption rate of UPLC is to monitor the consumable business associated with UPLC, and what we've seen is underlying consistent growth, and it's actually very encouraging. The adoption rate of the technology has been more slow and consistent and steady than we anticipated 10 years ago when we first launched UPLC. But it's actually been a nice core growth driver for the overall corporation's business.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks, Dan. And maybe we have time for one or two more questions?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Gene, when you look at the recurring revenue growth, the strength there, I guess, is there a way to get more granular on the drivers there, whether it's price or kind of the same-store sales numbers or new products? Is there a way to kind of dive into that? Really, what I'm trying to get at is to better understand how sustainable that level is.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. Jeff, maybe I'll make a quick comment, then Gene can. In terms of breaking apart the recurring, again, you have to break it down by service and by consumables. And certainly, the factors you mentioned are all elements we look at. We try to enhance price. We want to make sure that on a same-store we're actually building market share, if you will, on our columns, in the installed base, but also as we just talked about in UPLC, the transition from HPLC to UPLC and the higher attach rates we get with UPLC and the value of those columns is definitely a factor that we try to break down as well, which gives us some comfort for the sustainability.","On service, it's really a matter of continuing in all geographies of the world to enhance our offering and try to get that more and more reflected in the contracted service plans, which is a key metric we look at in terms of what by geography and really by type of customer.","And on top of that, you've heard me talk about the customer experience, and we rigorously measure loyalty and the Net Promoter Score and our customer experience, which is highly correlated to increasing net service lines. So those are the factors I'd say that we look at mostly.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just a follow-up there on the attach rates, the UPLC attach rates, can you remind us kind of where you are today and kind of how that's strengthened over the past year? Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah. I mean, the attach rates for UPLC are nicely over half, more in the 60%-ish range and that's very strong and it's a multiple or so higher than on the HPLC.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just to go back to the pharma markets for a second. I think I heard some comments earlier that your guidance, Gene and Chris, for the remainder of the year assumes more balanced growth over the remainder of 2016 across the end markets. As you mentioned, that academic and the government particular should pick up because of the NIH budget. Are you assuming a moderation in pharma? How do you think about pharma for the remainder of the year?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Yeah, that's a fair question, Miroslava, and certainly we are making assumptions that give us the balance because of natural questions in the market and while we do certainly expect the pharma market to continue to grow at above our overall company growth rate, it's fair to say that we don't have unrealistic expectations in terms of the type of growth rates in the market we've seen in recent quarters. And so, I think we are taking that balanced view and looking at that portfolio of end markets to converge somewhat over the course of the year.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And on the \u2013 just to be clear on the TA DSC line. When do you roll it out and is that the back half of the year impact of the numbers or is it more of a 2017?","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Well, hopefully, it'll have an impact in both of those periods. The rollout begins in the mid to later part of the second quarter. And so, we expect it to first really be seen in a little bit in the coming quarter but in the back half of the year. And obviously when you roll out a new platform like that and look at your installed base both for upgrade as well as new placements, that is a multi-quarter, if not multi-year effect. So, hopefully, we'll see the benefit of that over the course of 2017 and even beyond.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking my question.","Christopher James O'Connell - President, Chief Executive Officer and Member - Board of Directors","Thanks.

All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Lynch - Waters Corp.","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the fourth quarter and full year 2016.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and those actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussion of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to third quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Lastly, as you recall in January of this year, we announced a new integrated structure for what was traditionally referred to as the Waters Division and TA Instruments Division. So, on this call and into the future, we will continue to refer to Waters products and markets and TA Instruments products and markets.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Also here for our commentary and the Q&A session is Gene Cassis, our Chief Financial Officer. As with past earnings calls, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results as well as some broader commentary.","Overall, we delivered a solid third quarter performance with sales growing 5% and adjusted non-GAAP EPS increasing 11%. Growth was driven by continued strong performance in our core biopharmaceutical business, sustained momentum in China and reliable recurring revenues globally, offset by flat sales in our industrial markets and general challenging governmental and academic demand. Earnings growth in the quarter continue to outpace our top-line performance due to ongoing operating expense discipline, as well as positive foreign currency translation effects in the P&L.","Taking a closer look at our business in major markets, our broadly defined biopharmaceutical market for Waters products and services once again led the way with 13% growth in the quarter. We saw this growth across all significant pharmaceutical workflows and in all major geographic regions. Year-to-date, our sales to the biopharmaceutical customers have grown 12%, which is particularly impressive in comparison to double-digit growth rates in the first nine months of 2015.","While growth contribution can be seen across multiple and customer types, our biopharmaceutical growth continues to be strongest in smaller, specialty and biotech firms. This is further evidence of a steadily increasing diversity and balance in our core business.","Our global industrial sector, which includes sales to the material characterization, food, environmental and fine chemicals market, grew 1% in the quarter. Global weakness from the chemical industry contributed to slower growth in both our TA Instruments and Waters product lines. Demand for food safety and food quality related applications fared better, however, with sales growing by 7%.","Looking at governmental and academic markets, we saw a 15% decline in the quarter, particularly influenced by softness in Japan, Europe and the U.S. As we have stated before, demand from these markets tends to be lumpy quarter to quarter. This past quarter, additional dynamics relating to the timing of order shipments skewed the results and we expect more stability in the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by low to mid single-digit improvements in Asia, excluding Japan.","Turning to product line dynamics in the quarter, Waters instrument sales grew 4%. Continued strong uptake for LC systems featuring the ACQUITY Arc module and for LC-MS systems incorporating our bench-top Tandem Quadrupole technologies were highlights of the quarter's performance.","Speaking of Tandem Quad mass spectrometers, Q3 saw an acceleration of sales for our Xevo TQ-S micro and the more recently introduced Xevo TQ-XS high performance Tandem Quadrupole instrument. These instruments are used for demanding quantification applications where high sensitivity, speed of analysis and reproducibility are required, whether analyzing small or large molecules, a single analyte or a panel of compounds.","On the research mass spec side, more labs are adopting our newly introduced Vion IMS QTof system as the advantages of seamlessly coupling ion mobility and high-resolution top (06:25) measurements are enabling new research workflows. Waters' total recurring revenue, the combination of servicing, chemistry consumables, grew 7% in Q3. Breaking out our recurring revenues, service grew at an 8% rate with global demand for service plans continuing to increase.","Sales of chemistry consumables were up 6% in the quarter with relatively balanced regional growth. Continued strong uptake for our protein columns and GlycoWorks labeling kits highlighted the robustness of our biopharmaceutical consumable sales trends. Additionally, sales of ACQUITY UPLC columns continue to demonstrate the increasing usage of UPLC technology in regulated workflows.","Turning to our TA Instruments business, revenues were up 1% for the quarter with flat sales in instrument systems and 6% growth in service revenues. These results were below our expectations given TA's strong product position in the current Discovery Series launch and seem to signal slower demand from industrial chemical customers, particularly in developed markets. We will continue to watch these markets closely and look to capitalize on opportunities to address pent-up demand as it materializes.","In the quarter, TA completed the acquisition of Rubotherm, a developer of a unique and high-performance thermogravimetric technology based on magnetic levitation. This exciting product line will fit squarely into our broader thermal analysis portfolio and sales channel and open up adjacent growth opportunities.","Finally, looking at the quarter geographically, Asia continues to be our strongest region with 13% growth, while sales in the Americas grew by 2% and European sales declined by 1%. The strength of our business in Asia was highlighted by strong double-digit sales growth in China and this in comparison to a strong prior year's quarter.","Within China, we saw growth across all of our markets and product lines with particular strength in pharmaceuticals. Looking specifically at our Chinese business with pharmaceutical customers, growth drivers included new regulatory requirements by the CFDA, which is China's Food & Drug Administration, which focus on increasing analytical rigor across key workflows to assure consistency of results and integrity of archive data. Our strength across LC optical and LC and MS as well as with our Empower chromatography data system has us well positioned to meet these needs. Furthermore, TA posted double-digit growth in China.","In Japan, sales from our Waters portfolio declined modestly at constant currency with growth in pharmaceutical sales offset by declines in industrial, government and academic spending. TA's performance in Japan was flat. Revenues in the Americas included a slight decline in the U.S. against the challenging base of comparison, offset by growth off easier comps in Latin America.","Our performance in the U.S. was a tale of two cities, with continuing strong pharmaceutical demand offset by lower governmental and academic spending. Pharmaceutical demand in the U.S. was strongest from specialty and biotech firms. Europe also saw strong biopharmaceutical trends, driven by demand for service and mass spectrometry technologies. Offsetting solid mid single-digit growth in Western Europe was weaker demand in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","Stepping back and looking at our year-to-date results, I am pleased with our overall performance as revenues have grown 6%, and adjusted non-GAAP EPS has grown 12%. Revenue through the first nine months has been solidly above estimated market growth rates, and the team has also effectively managed our spending to deliver operating leverage, while continuing to invest appropriately in new innovations and customer support to fuel our future growth.","From the beginning of the year, we expected our big three growth drivers, namely the biopharma market, our China geography and recurring revenues of chemistry and service to all be sources of strength. If anything, performance from these sources has exceeded our expectations. And while our other market and geography segments have materialized somewhat differently than we originally expected, we don't see any factors that affect our ability to deliver the overall results we are targeting for the year.","Moreover, we feel we are poised to benefit from improvement in market conditions in the industrial, government and academic markets when they occur. So as we look at the fourth quarter and beyond, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core business and key growth drivers and are pleased that business trends in these areas suggest a continuation of strong and sustainable operating performance.","Now, I'd like to pass the call over to Gene for a deeper review of the financials. Gene?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the third quarter, our revenues came in at $527 million, an increase of about 5%. The impact of currency translation in the quarter was about neutral. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quarter were up 11% to $1.57 in comparison to earnings of $1.42 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.53 compared to $1.40 for the third quarter of last year.","On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 12% to $4.41 in comparison to earnings of $3.94 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $4.26, compared to $3.82 for the comparable period in 2015. Our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in our press release issued this morning.","On the product front, our Waters products and services sales were up 5%, while TA's were up 1%. Breaking that down somewhat, LC and MS instrumentation platform sales increased by 4%, and TA's instrument sales were flat. Our total recurring revenue associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7% with TA service revenue up 6%.","Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter and before currency translation, U.S. and European sales were down 1%, Japan is down 2% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 18%. As Chris noted, sales of Waters products were particularly strong in China. As for TA, global product sales were up 1% overall with mid single-digit decreases in the U.S. and Europe, offset by strong double-digit growth in China.","Now I'd like to comment on our third quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 58.6% versus 58.7% in the third quarter of last year. The year-to-date gross margin percentage is about equal to that of the first three quarters of 2015 with currency still a slight headwind.","Moving down to P&L, SG&A expenses were up 2% on a constant currency basis and flat on a non-GAAP reported basis. R&D expenses, including those associated with new product development and incremental investments, grew 8% in the quarter on a constant currency basis, but decreased by 1% on a reported basis, this primarily due to the weaker British pound.","On the tax front, our effective non-GAAP operating tax rate for the quarter was about 14% versus 12.7% in the third quarter of 2015. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 81.4 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than the third quarter of last year, this being a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Turning now to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.7 billion and debt was about $1.8 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $931 million. As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 440,000 shares of our common stock for $69 million. This leaves $206 million on our authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.","In the third quarter of 2016, free cash flow came in at $128 million after funding $21 million of capital, and excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of investments associated with facility expansions.","Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days in the quarter. Inventory levels were up approximately 6% in comparison to the prior quarter, reflecting typical seasonal patterns.","As we think about our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016, we anticipate constant currency sales growth of approximately 5%. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to modestly increase the sales growth.","Moving down the P&L, we expect gross margin percent for the fourth quarter to sequentially improve from the third quarter's and approach 60%. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled and will grow moderately from those in the prior year's quarter while we continue to fund R&D initiatives.","Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $7 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at 14%.","Rolling these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $2.08 to $2.18. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first nine months of 2016 and assuming a fully diluted share count of about 81.5 million shares, we now anticipate full year 2016 reported sales growth of about 6% and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.48 to $6.58, which maintains the midpoint of our full-year guidance as communicated at the end of the last quarter.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Chris.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Great. Thank you, Gene. Before we open the phone lines for Q&A, I just like to add one comment. Since I started at Waters a little more than a year ago, the investment community has been very supportive and engaging as I dug in with the team to operate the business, build the team, and chart the future.","Given my interest in providing you deeper insights into Waters and our future direction, I'm pleased to communicate that we will host an Investor Day on Thursday, March 2, 2017 in New York City. Preliminary planning is under way for an agenda that will feature presentations from our management team on a more comprehensive view of our business and future goals and strategies as well as an opportunity for Q&A and informal interaction. We'll provide more details as this event approaches.","And with that, we'll now open the lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","Thank you, and, Natalie, please open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate your comments on the academic markets in the prepared statements, but I was hoping you could put a little more context. We've seen a few companies this quarter now kind of echo a similar pressure in that channel, and I was wondering if you could maybe help us reconcile. It seems like funding in the U.S. is better this year, but it's not translating into dollars. So, just thoughts on why that's the case and when we might see a turn.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Isaac. I'll make a few comments, and Gene may want to follow up as well. And I agree with your point that we don't really see a funding problem out there. In fact, if anything in the broader picture and you see this in headlines and in terms of what the government is interested in and a number of different funding sources, there definitely seems to be a renaissance in medical research and other areas that will ultimately translate into spending in the academic sector.","As I commented in my comments, the patterns here tend to be quite lumpy. There is less recurring revenue, as you know, in these segments, more oriented towards high-end mass spectrometry. And frankly, we have pretty good visibility to orders. And just looking at a bunch of timing factors around orders, I think that tends to distort numbers quarter to quarter sometimes. So, again, our outlook is in this particular area to be conservative and to be cautious but looking for opportunities to do better, and that's the way we're looking at it.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Maybe just a clarifying question on that last comment you made about orders. So, could you maybe quantify the extent to which delayed orders might have had an impact on that part of the business, either to total top line or to growth in the academic channel and should we assume that the majority of that translates into the fourth quarter based on your current guidance?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","I'd rather not quantify that specifically, Isaac, other than to say that we do try to calculate that and try to get a sense as to what the overall end market is capable of in the foreseeable future, and that's why we don't see this as a crisis per se but really the vagaries of timing and a cautious outlook on these markets which are a little bit less predictable given our revenue composition in the area.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Just a couple of clarifying questions. Could you clarify the M&A contribution in the quarter and the full year expectation? And then on the fourth quarter guidance, you do have two extra days in the quarter, if I'm not mistaken. So, that's sort of implying a general slowdown in the business from the year-over-year comps. Is that the wrong way to sort of look at it?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Derik, I'll let Gene comment mostly on this, but the M&A contribution is very small at this point. And in terms of the extra days, yes, there are extra days, but it's generally within the noise, and we didn't bank too much on the two extra days. So, Gene, go ahead.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","Hi, Derik. In terms of looking at the M&A contribution in the quarter that we just reported on, it was around 20 basis points of revenue growth. And in terms of looking at the effects of the selling days on the fourth quarter's performance, as you know from following this company for many years, the days typically affect our recurring revenues. And a good rule of thumb is that each day, additional day can contribute about a percentage of growth to our recurring revenues. And with recurring revenues being about half of our business, that would translate into a benefit of about a percentage point of growth. So, it is really not the caution on recurring revenues that leads to our assumptions about the fourth quarter's performance. I think our conservatism is much more around the capital spend...","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","...concerns about continued industrial weakness, and again, as Chris so well characterized, the government and academic that it's a little bit tough to call just given the lumpiness of it. So, there's a little bit of conservatism on the capital spend that's built into the fourth quarter outlook.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And just one final clarification. So, you're not expecting as big a budget flush in pharma then?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","Well, you know what? The pharmaceutical performance was strong in the prior-year quarter. The momentum that we see in pharmaceuticals early in this fourth quarter continues to be encouraging. But I think to assume that the pharmaceutical world continues on a trajectory that's close to a mid-teens rate would be something that we're not particularly comfortable with. So, I think...","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","...as we begin to look at our expectations for the fourth quarter, a little bit of moderation of that pharmaceutical growth I think is warranted, still very healthy, but just not at the rate that we reported in the third quarter, Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for the clarification.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Groberg from UBS. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Hey, Chris. You guys ended the year with just under $1 billion if net cash, and Danaher just bought Phenomenex, which I know is an asset that you would think would fit kind of nicely under your guys's umbrella. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how you're thinking about capital allocation and use of that cash?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Sure. Yeah, I think the story on capital deployment, Jon, is very consistent with what we've always done. As you know, we have a well-established share repurchase program that we anticipate continuing. As far as M&A goes, I've been very clear since the day I walked in here that we will actively look at those opportunities, but it's not a core strategy of the company. M&A is really a tactic to execute a business strategy, and certainly, we'll say more about this over time including at the investor meeting early next year, but suffice it to say, we'll look at everything out there, but we're going to be very disciplined about those types of decisions. So, certainly, if the right opportunities presented themselves and they made sense strategically, they made sense financially, we'd be interested, but at this point in time, we've taken a more conservative approach on that.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","And this is my quick follow-up. I guess, as you look out there and you see some of these chess pieces that are moving around, are you seeing any signs, either on the instrumentation business or the chemistry business, are you seeing any signs in terms of the way your customers are behaving or any changes in the way your customers are behaving or any impact of what some of your competitors are doing?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Jon, that's absolutely the right question to ask, and it's the question we ask as well, which is, is there benefit to breadth in the customer purchasing process. And at this point, we don't really see any signs that that is the case. We believe we benefit from our focus and our depth in the particular workflows we're focused on. And within those areas, we're actually more comprehensive than any of our competitors, say, for example, in the five main areas of chromatography, mass spectrometry, chemistry, service, and informatics.","When you look at that bundle and the workflows that surround those areas, we're number one altogether, and we've got strength in every one of those components but also an ability to put those together as a system for the key workflows in our chosen markets. And so, it's a very fair question. It's the right question and it's one we'll continue to evaluate, but at this point, I certainly don't see any competitive advantage from just having more product categories in a purchasing type of scenario.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Just to start on TA, what were new product contributions to growth in the quarter? What's current backlog? And as we begin to think about 2017, do you still believe the series of new TA instrument launches can help drive at least corporate average growth even if industrial end market challenges persist or based on what we're seeing now, should we tamper our expectations?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. Good question, Doug, and you've pointed out an important point which is that from a product position standpoint in TA, we're in a great situation. We're I'd say midway through the early stages of the launch of the Discovery series with the DSC and the TGA instruments in the market with still several more versions to come. I would say the contribution from those particular product lines is relatively modest right now and that the situation in TA relative to the top line is more reflecting of the industrial chemical end markets and just a little bit of sluggishness in those markets right now.","We're extremely vigilant about trying to understand that and feel that whenever there is sign of life in those markets that we're going to do very, very well. That particular instrument product line actually gives us new capability, increasing pricing power, actually better margins. And so, we're actually in the general sense quite optimistic about the performance of TA and giving that particular product line a lot of support right now and just trying to manage our way through a little softer end market.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, a margin question. So, SG&A was flat year-over-year reported, up 2% in constant currency terms. And really that type of leverage was really the most important driver to you meeting EPS expectations in the quarter. How much was the leverage there? How much of that was that driven by revenue weakness versus true operational discipline? What's the sustainability of this type of leverage at the SG&A line looking forward?","And then moving up the P&L, looking at the gross margin line, could you provide some more color on the puts and takes to gross margin in the quarter? By our estimates, the weakening of the pound may have provided around 50 basis point benefit and in spite of that gross margin decline, 10 bps year-over-year. If you could provide a little more detail there as well, that would be helpful.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Doug. Let me make a couple of comments, and then Gene can provide some additional data points. You're right. We did get SG&A leverage, and that's a combination of, I would say, three factors, certainly a little bit of revenue weakness lowered some of the sales-type spending, very strong operating discipline, and this team, as you know, has a history of disciplined operating management, and so we obviously have the ability to manage expenses tightly while still making sure we're doing the right things for growth.","And we got a little bit of FX benefit as well. I think it's important to say as well SG&A will be an area that we continue to look for operating leverage over time, especially in the interest of maintaining or even enhancing our investment in R&D. I've said before that as long as we can cover it and still get operating leverage in the P&L and as long as I'm convinced that there is good R&D productivity, I'm even interested in increasing our commitment to innovation. Being the most vital organic grower and innovator in the industry is an important strategy of ours. And so, I'm very pleased that we're able to get operating leverage primarily through the SG&A line, at the same time, increasing our focus on innovation and fueling the new product pipeline.","So, I think there is a good balance in the P&L right now. And I think many of those factors are indeed sustainable, and we want to obviously have that type of philosophy going forward. So, I'll let Gene comment a little more specifically on the puts and takes in the gross margin.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","Sure. Thank you very much, Chris, and hi, Doug. Looking at the gross margin like in every quarter, there are pushes and pulls. And you're right that we did get some FX benefit in the gross margin line, primarily from the Japanese yen and yes, some benefit from the British pound. Offsetting that was some dynamics in terms of product mix and geographical mix of the business. Historically, TA has been a very high gross margin business for us and was a little bit weaker in the quarter. So, that was one of the factors that influenced gross margin. And we had a very strong quarter in the area of service, which is a little bit dilutive to the gross margin, but it's nicely accretive to the operating margin.","There's been a lot of focus on the valuation of the British pound post the Brexit vote, and I just wanted to comment that we didn't really see the full effect of the pound's current value in these third quarter results as the pound weakened throughout the quarter. So, the average rate of the pound wasn't quite as favorable as it is today, but where we see it most dramatically is in our R&D expense. I think we had talked about there being about a 9 percentage point difference between the constant currency R&D growth and the actual reported R&D growth. So, those are some of the factors where currency affected our P&L in the quarter.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","All right. Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, guys. Just want to get back on the CapEx side and again, just I know we're not going to get detailed bookings color, but can you just give us a sense in some of the markets where you either saw choppiness like academic and government or actual weakness in Europe or industrial, what the cadences looked like in those markets and how you feel about visibility?","So, what I'm trying to get a sense of \u2013 because it seems like you're suggesting a lot of these issues are sort of temporal. Are you seeing something like in the very early parts of sort of the booking cycle where you're feeling like there are signs of recovery? Are you just looking at the period at which some of those markets have been depressed? And assuming you see some shift back, is some of it based off of maybe a lack of political uncertainty? Obviously, we've got with what's going on with the Brexit and the presidential election in the U.S. kind of uncertainty. I'm just trying to get a little bit of color for how you're thinking about that cadence, particularly in some of the markets where it's been a bit choppy.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Ross. Let me try to add some value on that comment that you're making. I think overall, I want to reiterate that I think the approach we're taking in these markets and really separating some of those growth drivers I talked about, which are really doing so well, pharma, China, recurring revenues, and we continue to focus on those. But in the areas that you mentioned, I think we're being quite balanced actually and cautious and conservative. And I don't think we have a feeling that there is some major cyclical trend that we're heading into. I think we see the normal back and forth of some of these markets particularly at the later point of the year. I don't have any evidence that political uncertainty is causing any abnormal issues here, certainly from a Brexit standpoint.","Our business in the UK and in Europe has actually been pretty steady. And just in the Europe context, while the overall number looked a little bit lower, you really have to separate Western Europe from Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The Western Europe part of that business is, as I mentioned, is quite stable and even the UK itself. Same comment on the U.S. political environment. We don't really see any linkage to the current election cycle to behaviors or attitudes in terms of the end customers.","We do have more visibility to certain of those subsectors, say, particularly in the academic world where we have a longer view into the pipeline. And as I mentioned before, without trying to quantify it, we see enough evidence in the trialing and the quoting and the ordering to say that hopefully, we'll have some opportunities to improve on what we did last quarter coming up here.","So, again, a conservative and a pragmatic approach in terms of the outlook in those markets but really truly looking for an opportunity to do better.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","And maybe just quickly going back on the biopharma side, I mean, we talked about this last quarter. But the sort of length of this cycle is probably atypical versus prior, but there's a number of reasons for that, and obviously, pipeline success has been quite good. As you talk to the sales force, many of which have been there for a long time or looking into that customer base, obviously, on a regular basis more deeply, how do they kind of characterize sort of the staying power at least on the CapEx side of demand and how they're thinking about how the order book sort of maintains over the next 12 months or 24 months?","And again, I'm not looking for quantitative guidance because I know we're not going to get that, but just more like anecdotally what their conversations are like today versus 12 months ago or what they are most keyed in on to sort of understanding the trajectory of that demand base?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. That's a terrific question, Ross, and that's exactly the right question, and it's probably the question I spend most of my time thinking about, embrace your core business, love your core business, and try to understand it at a deeper level. And clearly, this question of cycles in pharmaceutical and staying power of demand, as you say, is exactly the point. And I guess my perspective \u2013 and I welcome Gene's more longer historical perspective as well \u2013 but my perspective is the pharma market we see today and that we expect to see just feels like a very steadily changing and different type of market than historical, potentially with less cyclicality, more balanced geographically, more balanced from an end customer standpoint.","I used the word earlier renaissance in medical research, but I think that term also applies to the drug development process. And we're seeing less and less dependence on the biggest customers, less and less dependence on traditional, large, integrated biopharmaceutical companies, more and more growth and innovation in the specialty area, the biotech area, obviously, on one end of the spectrum, a real growth in the generic category driven by rising patient access to medical therapies around the world, but on the other end, an increasing drive for innovation and increasing complexity of molecules that are under development and frankly, that have more challenging characterization requirements.","I'm personally spending a ton of my time with customers still, and many of these factors are reinforced. And so, we're excited about what's happening in the pharma world and all of those factors, and we'll continue to try to quantify that and really lean into that. So, we're really maximizing our performance in our core business which is our strategic goal number one.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Maybe, Chris, following up on that last point, you had another sequential increase in biopharma. I think last quarter, you talked about large pharma picking up a bit. I think it was up mid-single digits. So, can you maybe talk to whether that trend continued? And then on the biotech side, how much is the strength that you're seeing is a result of investments you're making into that channel? And are you seeing any shift in product mix with the growth in biotech?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. First of all, as it relates to large pharma, I would say we continue to see steady performance out of large pharma. It's not our fastest growing segment but it's there. It comes in and out a little bit quarter to quarter, but we're certainly not declining in that segment. And actually, I think large pharma is doing pretty well right now as a sector and end market but really, a lot of the growth, as you point out, is coming from specialty and biotech and so forth. I guess, I've spent a lot of time studying this this year, and I think the company made a bet five or seven or eight years ago, something in that timeframe to really develop more application support for the biotech world.","And we've used a couple of examples of that in terms of some of the consumables and kits but also the workflows around the mass spec product line. And I think what we're seeing is we've seen a steady increase in market share in the large molecule segment. The large molecule segment is growing faster than the small molecule segment in general for the future, and it's a very, very different market. And that's what we're trying to do is really unstack the stack and understand it with more granularity, what the demands are in each of these subsets. But I think our biotech offering and you see this reflected in our current products but also as we share more of our product pipeline for the future continued strong emphasis on this biotech sector.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then maybe one on Japan. It's been core for a while. Obviously, there's been volatility in the yen. Do you see things kind of bottoming out there or what's the outlook?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Japan is mixed as we commented. The pharma sector in Japan is solid right now. And like I said, the pharma sector around the world has been pretty balanced, and that's true in Japan. In Japan where we've been through a little bit of a cycle and saw it again this quarter with less spending on the government side and declined some pretty good size declines in that sector as the government has prioritized other national investments in the wake of some of the unfortunate disasters there. There are some infrastructure rebuilding that has what we believe temporarily moved money away from some of the research government-type research business, but Gene may want to comment more on that.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","No, I think that's very accurate. And as Chris mentioned, the pharmaceutical spend in Japan continues to be robust. The other thing that we're seeing is that, that is a country that is very receptive to new technologies, and the uptake of some of TA's new Discovery products is something that we're very optimistic on as we look at the industrial opportunity in Japan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then if I could just ask one last quick clarification. I think it's an important point. As we think about next year, obviously, there's been a lot of focus on the pound movement implications to earnings. It sounds like from your comments, Chris, you may use that as an opportunity to take up investments. Is that the right way to not actually think about it all flowing through?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","I'm sorry. Can you repeat the last part of that an opportunity to what -","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm just trying to think about given the currency moves and the implied benefits for 2017 earnings, it sounds like you're going to actually be taking up spending a bit next year. Is that the right interpretation? So, the currency moves may not necessarily flow through.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","I don't think that's necessarily fair to say. We're right in the middle of our budgeting cycle, and I think like history and we've implied all the way along here, we're going to be prudent and cautious. It's our goal to sustain very attractive top line growth and to deliver some modest operating leverage while continuing to invest in R&D and in our sales force. And so, I don't anticipate any sort of a step change spending increase program. We're just going to continue to be very, very disciplined about how we deploy our capital internally.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for clarifying.","Operator","Next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup.Your line is now open.","Dan Arias - Citigroup","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Chris, maybe just some color on new products and the competitive environment and industrial. Do you feel like the instruments that you're coming to market with are coming at a time when your competitors are doing a similar thing or do you think you're a bit off cycle, so to speak, which maybe has your \u2013 the potential for your portfolio to stick out a bit for those that are thinking about purchasing?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","That's a good question, Dan I would say I'm still learning about the competitive landscape relative to product cycles and what they're trying to do. But frankly, I'm 100% focused on what we're trying to do and making sure we're doing the right thing for Waters. So, I don't know that I have a perfectly clairvoyant vision on your question. I look at what we're doing in product development and take the last four or five big products we've done like the QDa mass detector, the ACQUITY Arc, a couple of really great new entrants in the mass spec category with Vion and then Xevo TQ-XS in the quantification area and then the stuff on the TA side.","I like the way these products are shaping up for the priority segments, these particular products that we're newer in the market with. And keep in mind, product launches in this sector continue to impress me as things that really deepen and build and scale more steadily over time rather than being quick hits. But you think about the key priorities around our core business in small molecules and technologies like the Arc and the advantages that gives us in a more flexible approach to methods in geographies like China. You look at the biotech development phase and the food safety area and some other things and the strength we have in the tandem quadrupole area.","And so, I think some of the products that we're emphasizing right now in our portfolio are very much at the core of the most important trends that we're trying to drive in the marketplace. And we'll over time give you a little more visibility into the pipeline for the future, but I've had an opportunity to spend a lot of time thinking about our portfolio and working with our engineering teams to make sure that what is coming next continues to build on this momentum.","Unknown Speaker","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, if we look at some of the M&A activity that's taking place in the chemical space, any reason to think that that's having a role in demand or the way that timing is shaping up?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","In the chemical space. I don't know. I think that's a fair question. I mean, obviously, you have Dow, DuPont out there, and those have been good customers for us. I haven't seen any evidence that there is some discontinuity in terms of demand from those types of customers. So, I think the industrial backdrop that we have been talking about on this call is something that many people have seen. It's across sectors and we're just trying to be very clear right about it and certainly not panicking and being conservative and cautious like I said but looking for opportunities and making sure we're poised to seize those opportunities because what happens when you're in a cycle like this is that pent-up demand builds, and we're looking for opportunities to get some big wins in that regard.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Very good. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick ones for me. One is a regional question. The growth in India doesn't get as much attention on this call as sometimes I think it maybe deserves. Can you give us a sense for what India growth specifically was in the quarter, what it's been year-to-date? And how the balance of the drivers there is evolving between some of the regulatory demands coming from parties outside India, and how much of it is volume and how are you thinking about the structural growth drivers (49:19) going forward. Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Steve. I'm glad you raised India, we do tend to talk about China a lot as a huge market and a high performing market, but India has been the same category. I very much think about India a lot and work with the team there. Our growth there has been in recent quarters and years, really solid in the mid-teens. And I think that reflects a couple of different things. Number one, it reflects the vibrancy of the generics market in terms of both the Indian companies and the multinational companies that are operating there, developing generic pharmaceuticals \u2013 producing generic pharmaceuticals for the world.","As you allude to in your question, the regulatory requirements from the FDA and other notified bodies and regulators around the world has been increasing. And so, we've done particularly well in that market and believe we built our market share position and actually have quite a high market share position in India based on our competitive advantage in chromatography data systems, i.e., Empower. It's a huge competitive advantage for us, it's one we continue to build upon and we're building a stronger and stronger foundation of loyalty in that market.","The other point about India that I find interesting is that not only is India an interesting market from a multinational standpoint and an export standpoint, but it's going to become over time a vibrant domestic market as well. And so, the strength of our franchise there over time, the strength of our relationships and our team sets us up well for other new waves of growth in India, so India is a huge priority, it's challenging to be our third-largest country in the world after the U.S. and China and will continue to be one of our top priorities.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Chris. And then just one update on the mix of the business to help us think about how to model going forward, I know historically the company has had a pretty healthy balance of revenue exposure within the pharma category between, let's call it R&D\/drug development on one side and then production and manufacturing on the other side. Given that we've seen so much growth in pharma as a category for you guys over the last couple of years, can you give us an update on what the balance is there between those two segments of pharma and where you're seeing more relative growth and how you're thinking about that over the next year or two? Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. We're pretty well balanced between development and production, more 50-50 between R&D and then the QC\/QA side. The QA\/QC side, as you know is more oriented towards recurring revenue and the service and the consumables, whereas the R&D side, a little more oriented towards capital.","We've traditionally been strongest in late-stage development and then QA\/QC and certainly as we \u2013 based on the earlier conversation we had on the changing nature of pharma, as there's been more activity in development in recent years from more sectors, particularly specialty and biotech, that's been an area of strength for us. But we also have opportunities, we can do better in earlier-stage development and even in the research side. And we're excited about some things we're working on to augment the strength we have on late-stage development in QC and to earlier stage development in research, and we want to continue to improve in all areas. So, I don't know that there's been any drastic changes in mix, I don't think so in terms of our overall business composition between those areas. But like anything, there's areas we do particularly well and areas we can improve.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks and a good morning.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I was hoping to put a little bit of a finer point on the academic, government decline. In particular, you called out the dynamics in the U.S. as being strong pharma offset by weaker academic, but I think the academic piece in the U.S. is fairly small. I guess first of all, can you quantify how much of your revenue is kind of U.S. academic, government, and then, how much was what particular piece down?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. That's a fair question, Tim and we don't want to quantify all the different growth rates by sub-segment, but just in a broad sense, about 15% of our worldwide business overall for the corporation is government and academic. And so, to your point, it is a smaller mix. Within the U.S., the pure academic sector may be around 10% and it ebbs and it flows a little bit and government adds to that.","So, you can see how a decline in these segments affects the overall result. And so, like I said we're taking a balanced view on one hand. We're not happy with the decline, and we want to do better and we believe we will do better. But on the other hand, keep it in perspective, and keep our number one focus on the core business and the sectors like pharma, like food and others that are giving us a lot of growth right now.","So, affecting the overall geography, it wasn't just as simple as pharma and then academic, there is a lot of other sectors within industrial too that as we pointed out have had more moderate growth, particularly in the industrial side that the chemical, materials, polymer environmental type end markets.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And would you just mind quantifying your exposure on the revenue and cost line to the yen, now that things have moved around so much?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","Yes. Tim, I just wanted to mention just as a follow up to Chris' comments on the U.S. that in this particular quarter, we were comparing against a mid-teens growth in the prior year quarter. So, please bear that in mind as you think about the particular growth rates in the U.S. in the third quarter.","And thinking about the yen, as we mentioned we had a slight decline in Japan on constant currency, but we had a double-digit growth rate at actual because of the appreciation of the yen, and Japan has been and continues to be a high single-digit percent of the corporation's business.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Good. I think we're coming closer to the top of the hour, but we have time for one or two more questions. So, maybe a couple more.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","Does that answer your question, Tim?","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our question comes from Matt Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hello, good morning and thank you for squeezing me in. On the recurring revenues, at least sequentially versus the first half, there was a modest deceleration of the sales growth. I was hoping you could tease out academic and government instrument versus recurring revenue. Did that also have an impact on the recurring revenues for the company as a whole, or is that too small?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","It's probably too small. It's good question, but probably a little bit too small. And once we start breaking our own numbers down in that level of granularity, there is too many exogenous factors to draw good conclusions but, yeah, I mean we did see a slightly moderating pattern there. But keep in mind earlier in the year, in a number of categories that continue to do well, we constantly, out of conservatism, expect some degree of moderation, and that was, as Gene said for the fourth quarter, even our best growth driver. So, these particular product lines or service lines, if you will, in the recurring revenues are a really core part of our story, and our competitive strength and the robustness of our ongoing business model. So, I think we're pleased overall with where that's at.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then just a follow-up on the gross margin side. Is there a lag on the pound impact to COGS not just as far as the actual pound coming down through the quarter, but actually on when it impacts you? And then, in other words, like in an FX neutral or FX positive environment, how should we be thinking about the appropriate contribution margin on increasing sales for the business?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","Let me start on that. I think that if the pound stays where it is today, Matt, we will get more of a full impact in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the pound devalued within the third quarter. And to your point, some of the positive effects of the pound on cost of goods sold are going to be dependent on just the product mix, and whether or not we sell the higher volumes of high resolution mass spectrometry systems, which are manufactured at our UK operation.","And I have to say that as a higher ticket item, those tend to be lumped a little bit more towards the closing months of a year. Chris had already mentioned about some orders migrating from the third quarter into the fourth quarter on the academic spend, and that was mostly represented by \u2013 in our higher-end mass spectrometry space.","Looking at next year, some things to consider is that we have had historically between 10% and 15% of cost of goods sold is pound-denominated. And probably more significantly, about a third of our R&D expense is denominated in sterling. So, those are some of the opportunities that we have maybe as we begin to look out into upcoming quarters to get a little bit more favorable impact on our P&L.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Good. I think we have time for one more please.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, Gene.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Guys, thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just two things for you. First following up, Gene, with you regarding your talking on the pound, is there any way that you can quantify what you're seeing now in terms of maybe an EPS impact from the weaker pound in your full year guidance versus what you were expecting three months or four months ago? And then secondly, just wondering if you could comment at all a little bit more color on geographic trend, particularly within China and the UK, just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on how strong China has been here recently and then also what you've seen in terms of end market demand in the UK since the Brexit. Thanks, guys.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Waters Corp.","Well, why don't I start out on the FX side and then I'll leave it to Chris to finish up on the second part of your question. Yes, we are enjoying a little bit more favorability in FX during the fourth quarter of this year than we had originally anticipated and to quantify it. It's about $0.05 more benefit across that period, more than we had originally anticipated. So, you're looking at $0.02 or $0.03 a quarter associated with total currency benefits in the third and fourth quarter.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","So, Steve, just quickly on your geographic questions to finish up and those are good questions to finish up, maybe I'll start with the UK and finish with China. We've seen very steady market conditions in the UK. Our UK business is roughly 4% or 5% of our global turnover, so it's one of our bigger countries, but it's also one that's quite balanced.","There's a strong pharmaceutical sector there, of course, and also a strong government and academic sector in the UK as well and so that market is an important market for us. We've seen steady performance and in the near-term don't see any impacts of Brexit, but we're very \u2013 we're paying very close attention to Brexit. In fact, I've dialed up my participation in the UK and been there a number of times, including to key thought leaders in government and in other sectors, to really advocate for the types of policies that will continue to promote the life science industry in the UK. The ecosystem of the life science industry in the UK is very critical to us, to Europe and to the world and I'm actually despite all the uncertainty confident that everybody understands that and will keep the interest of that industry in mind as the negotiation gets underway. So, again much of that is out of our control, but to the extent we have a voice in what some of those policies are, we're going to be active in that process.","From the standpoint of China, again we don't want to get too specific other than to say we're operating at a high level in China right now. I thinks that's a function of two or three things. First of all it's just a strong overall economic backdrop relative to the priorities of government. We're between year one and year two of the 13th Five-Year Plan, and we studied that very deeply and very well aware as to what the government is trying to do particularly around advancing and incubating the local pharmaceutical sector and rising quality standards there and rising data standards there, as well as in the food industry and the area of traditional Chinese medicine, those are three of our big priorities.","We're seeing a lot of balance across those right now. We're seeing the rapid adoption of some of our newer technologies like the ACUITY Arc that really allow many of these sectors to get up to speed quickly, but also advance to more innovative, up-to-date methods. And so it's a pretty robust market, but I think one of the reasons we're having success there is that we've got a very strong team. We've been in China for a long time, we're coming up on nearly 500 employees in China, we have a huge commitment there. We're very active with a number of the key opinion leaders and academic centers there. I'm actually heading back over to China in a few weeks to dig even deeper because we think that what's happening there is very positive for our industry, for our business and it's at the very top of our list.","So, anyway, thanks for that question and let me also now just move to conclude the call.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","As we move into the fourth quarter of 2016 and begin to focus on 2017, we're very encouraged by our year-to-date performance. The strength of our key growth drivers has enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth through the first three quarters of the year.","So, on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2016 call, which we currently anticipate holding on January 24, 2017. And with that I thank you and wish you a wonderful day.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to this Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters division; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations. As is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, and John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the first quarter of 2013 and for the full year of 2013. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.","John A. Ornell","During the course of this conference call, we will be making various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q1 and full year 2013. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, in Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2013.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled, Reconciliation of Net Income per Diluted Share included in this morning's press release.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Okay. Thank you, John. Well, 2012 was certainly a challenging year for Waters, especially in comparison to the stronger growth rates we enjoyed in 2010 and 2011. After a slower-than-expected start to the year, we recalibrated our expectations and continued to track at a pretty consistent organic growth rate through the following quarters. However, and as we have seen in previous periods of sluggish demand, pricing held up across our product line and we were able to control our expense growth. These factors were important in delivering stable levels of profitability.","If you look at 2012 growth rates across our major product lines, we continued to benefit from newer core offerings in chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal technologies. Our recurring revenues, the combination of chromatography consumables and total instrument service sales, generated consistent growth in 2012 and contributed to our overall profitability.","Pharmaceutical end markets were mostly stable across the year while many industrial chemical customers, given the weaker general economic conditions, held back on capital spending. Governmental and academic spending during the year, as might have been expected, was pretty soft.","Geographically, we were pleased by the relative strength of our business in Europe. At the onset of the year, the concerns that instability in smaller European Union countries would spread across the continent appeared to have been somewhat overstated. And in fact, European pharmaceutical demand remains sufficiently strong to offset the somewhat slower sales to governmental and chemical consumers.","Our business in developing regions was mixed during the year. Most importantly, growth in China remained robust off a strong 2011 performance. On the other hand, a convergence of issues hampered our performance in India. Our developing market businesses in Eastern Europe, South America and Eastern Asia delivered uneven results and cumulatively performed at levels weaker than we had hoped.","There are some speculation that the potentially recessionary economic conditions in the larger consuming economies, principally Western Europe and the United States, limited scientific investment growth in the more fragile export-oriented countries. We are hopeful that an outlook for moderate but stable global economic growth in 2013 will result in a recovery of spending for analytical tools in many of these developing countries.","On the competitive front, we feel the landscape remain relatively unchanged in 2012. At this point, nearly all companies offering liquid chromatography systems have acknowledged the momentum toward UPLC-type separations, and we feel confident that our leadership position will allow us to continue to direct future market developments and maintain a premier market share position. Our ACQUITY H-Class instrument system continued to bridge UPLC capability to classical HPLC applications.","Also on the separations technology front, we launched our UPC2 system in 2012. An industry first of its kind, UPC2 has begun to establish a new performance category in analytical instrumentation that meaningfully improves workflows across many applications. In mass spectrometry, I believe we have established a performance leading position in tandem quadrupole technology, and sales growth for our Xevo TQ-S in 2012 suggests a strengthening market position. In applications ranging from clinical drug development to food safety testing, Xevo TQ-S offers a new level of sensitivity combined with high reliability and usability.","In 2012, sales of our top base instruments declined in comparison to somewhat stronger 2011 results. However, recent business activity for instruments, such as our SYNAPT HDMS and Xevo QTof systems, has improved, and we are anticipating a return to growth in 2013.","Our TA Instruments division performed well in 2012. For the full year, TA's constant currency revenues were up about 8%. Following a double-digit growth performance in 2011 and in light of global economic weakness, these results are pretty impressive. High points for TA in 2012 include the continued successful integration of purchased businesses into the TA portfolio and the buildout of a discovery line of thermal analyzers and rheometers. In 2012, TA also successfully acquired new product lines and technologies to expand their business into high temperature material characterization markets.","Looking at the fourth quarter, our constant currency sales grew about 1.5%, and our adjusted earnings at a moderately higher level. These results were in line with our expectations and include both the adverse impact to margins from a recently significantly weaker Japanese yen and the positive effect of a lower-than-anticipated tax rate. For the Waters division, we saw growth in our pharmaceutical end markets, significantly driven by strong demand in Europe and China, a continuation of a dynamic that we saw in the third quarter.","The global combination of government and university shipments declined at a mid-single digit rate in the quarter, with weakness in academic demand most pronounced in Europe, Japan and in a few smaller countries. U.S. government and academic sales held up well with recent ordering trends suggesting stronger, high-end mass spec demand.","Looking at our applied markets and focusing on food and environmental applications, we have a history of healthy but lumpy growth performance. In the fourth quarter, our global food and environmental growth was down in comparison to last year. However, the decline came as a result of strong growth in the U.S. market, offset by a more significant decline in Europe. We are encouraged to see more food testing uptake in the U.S. as we feel that this market represents a large future growth opportunity. In fact, within the last month, the U.S. Congress passed legislation sending a clear message detailing the importance of scientific training on advanced methods of analysis. This is certainly encouraging for Waters as we have actively assisted in developing such methods and training protocols in cooperation with global regulatory agencies.","Our TA division finished 2012 with a strong fourth quarter performance, completing a year of profitable growth. In the quarter, constant currency sales were up 7%. TA's organic growth was primarily driven by continued global adoption of discovery thermal and rheology systems and generally strong international sales. High-temperature instrument sales also contributed nicely to the division's overall performance in the quarter, a trend that's promising for 2013.","Looking at the Waters division fourth quarter sales geographically, constant currency sales growth in Europe was in line with the company's overall growth rate. European strength in biopharmaceutical markets was offset by weak academic and chemical analysis sales, including a decline in applied market instrument system sales against the tough prior year comparison. European pharmaceutical results included healthy spending from large global firms in the region.","In China, our sales growth was strong and broad based in the quarter, with most major product and market segments growing at double-digit rates. The fourth quarter results in China complete a year of strong growth in a very important market for Waters. Our competitive position in China is strong, and our access to the most attractive analytical market segments within China is reflected in the sales growth and profitability we have delivered in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","On the other hand, our sales in India were lighter than we had hoped as local currency weakness, recent drug manufacturing and CRO issues, combined with government inertia, have contributed to slower business momentum. We continue to believe that underlying demand for new instruments, primarily for generic drug manufacturers in India, remains strong, and we anticipate seeing improved ordering trends in upcoming quarters. We remain confident in being able to maintain a leading share position and know that in the long run, India is an important and attractive market for us.","Waters division constant currency sales in Japan were moderately down in the fourth quarter as weaker industrial chemical results offset strong growth in our pharmaceutical business. We're cautiously optimistic that a recent weaker yen may stimulate more business in 2013 from our industrial chemical export-oriented customers in Japan.","In the U.S., and staying on the Waters division performance, we saw the strongest growth in instrumentation for our applied markets, including food and environmental testing. A modest decline in shipments to pharmaceutical segments is largely accounted for by weaker sales to large accounts, interestingly, the same set of customers that grew nicely in Europe. Combination of government and academic business grew at a solid mid-single rate in the quarter, with increased business activity in the high-end mass spectrometry system.","Now, I'll discuss some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. The growth in chromatography consumables was strongest in China and more moderate in most other regions. Sales growth of ACQUITY UPLC columns suggests a continuation of high attachment rates and of a gradual increase in UPLC technology and regulated methods. Our service business growth was more geographically balanced and close to a double-digit rate in most regions.","Looking at our Waters division instrument system sales, performance was comparable for LC\/MS instruments and LC instruments in the quarter, with moderate declines in sales in comparison to last year's results. For LC\/MS, our strongest performing instrument systems embodied Xevo TQ-S mass spec technology combined with ACQUITY UPLC. This configuration is a workhorse tool for quantitative bioanalysis applications and drug development. And as I mentioned earlier, there are signs based on our recent ordering trends in the fourth quarter of 2012 and as we start 2013 that we are seeing improvements in our high-end top base demand.","On the chromatography front, ACQUITY UPLC continued to edge into more QC applications. We believe that opportunity to see higher utilization of UPLC technology and QC application lies ahead of us. Up to this point, expansion into this segment has been limited by a combination of the 10-year length of the drug development cycle and by the somewhat restricted spending environment at most large pharmaceutical accounts. When drugs that are currently under development in labs that are using UPLC technology eventually make their way at volume production, we are confident that the preferred QC methodologies will transition to UPLC technology.","Continuing on the chromatography front, 2012 marked the start of Waters' entry into a new separations technology that leverages the high resolving power of supercritical carbon dioxide in a high performance analytical format. We introduced our ACQUITY UPC2 platform at Pittcon 2012, and after receiving the Editors' Gold Award recognizing this system as the most innovative showcase at the conference, shipment volumes have nicely ramped through the remainder of the year. In 2013, we expect to see a positive impact of this system on our overall results, especially as UPC2 has the potential to improve analytical workflows at our customer labs while driving sales growth at Waters for not only new instruments but also associated growth in specialized ACQUITY columns and customer service plans.","Well, so where do we go from here? In 2013, look for us to continue to introduce new application-tailored systems that offer more complete workflow benefits to customers. As you've seen for the past couple of years, you should expect that these systems will combine advanced mass spectrometry, ACQUITY UPLC and UPC2, our new unified operating system platform, application-specific separation chemistries and software applications. In addition, I expect that 2013 will be an exciting year for new instrument platform introductions. We have maintained a rich R&D product pipeline, and we look forward to significant launches at conferences this spring, which will showcase innovations in LC\/MS and thermal analysis.","In 2012, our sales and earnings growth rates were well below historical averages and our long-standing internal benchmarks. Though we are confident that generally weaker market conditions were responsible for our 2012 performance, we feel that these market conditions are temporary, and accordingly, we will maintain the same long-term internal growth targets for sales and earnings growth and manage our business to best achieve these long-term goals. We continue to believe that our technologically-focused business strategy and conservative asset allocation plan will continue to benefit our customers, employees and shareholders.","Before turning it over to John, let me say that I am cautiously optimistic that 2013 will be a better year for Waters than 2012. Looking at the macro environment, the global economy appears more stable, and our outlook for business growth in nearly all geographic locations is positive. I'm also confident that our competitive position remains strong and that planned new product introductions will further enhance our competitive leadership position.","Now I'd like to turn it over to John for a review of our financials and an update on the future outlook.","John A. Ornell","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Fourth quarter sales were about the same as last year's, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 2% at $1.59 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.56 last year. However, on a GAAP basis, our earnings were $2 this quarter versus $1.51 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning. Our GAAP results this quarter contain a large tax benefit associated with recent tax planning activities that will allow us to access previously trapped net operating losses and apply them to future taxable income streams within our legal entity structure. This will result in reduced cash payments for taxes over the next several years than would otherwise have been the case. This benefit is calculated to be about $36 million and results in $0.41 of EPS benefit in our GAAP results. These benefits do not affect our non-GAAP earnings.","Reviewing Q4 sales results in comparison with Q4 last year before foreign currency translation, sales were up about 1.5% and currency translation reduced sales by just over 1%. Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were down 3%, Europe sales were up 2%, Japan was up 1% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 12%. On the product front and in constant currency, within the Waters division, instrument system sales decreased by 5% and recurring revenues grew by 8% this quarter. Within the TA Instruments division, total sales increased by 7% versus prior year.","Now I would like to comment on our Q4 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in at 60.1%, down modestly from Q4 last year. This decline was largely the result of currency translation as the combination of a stronger British pound and a much weaker yen increased our manufacturing cost and reduced our sales volume, respectively. SG&A expenses were down 1% as a result of net favorable currency translation, continued tight spending controls and lower variable compensation expenses. R&D expenses increased by 5% this quarter.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate came in favorable to our earlier estimates at 15.2% for the full year. This reduction was due to a favorable shift in income among our legal entities. And for 4Q, the cumulative full year catch-up benefit of this change lowered our effective Q4 tax rate to 13.8%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6.4 million and share count came in at 87.9 million shares, 2.7 million shares lower than Q4 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.","Looking at our earnings per share for Q4, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share contain a couple of unexpected items that largely offset each other. First, we had about $0.04 of foreign currency translation cost, about 1\/2 of which is the result of rapid currency movements late in the quarter. And second, we had $0.04 of tax favorability resulting from the more favorable mix of legal entity profits discussed earlier. On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,539,000,000 and debt totaled $1,178,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $361 million. As for Q4 share repurchases, we bought 720,000 shares of our common stock for $61 million. This leaves $643 million remaining on our most recently authorized share repurchase program.","We defined free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any non-cash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. For Q4, free cash flow came in at $120 million after funding $18 million of CapEx. Excluded from the CapEx cited is $13 million of capital associated with our new U.K. mass spectrometry facility. We expect this facility to be ready for occupancy by the end of 2013.","Accounts receivable, day sales outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up 6 days from Q4 last year. DSO was impacted by geographic distribution of our Q4 sales and does not indicate a change in the overall quality of our receivables. In the quarter, and as is typical for year end, inventories decreased by $17 million. So for the full year 2012, sales pre-currency effects grew by 2%, while currency translation reduced sales by 2%. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 2% to $4.93 versus $4.81 in 2011.","Now looking ahead to full year 2013, we expect economic conditions to modestly improve as the year progresses. We believe our strong product lineup, coupled with a favorable base of comparison, should allow us to grow our constant currency sales for the full year around 5%. We generally use foreign currency spot rates when we calculate guidance, but given the extraordinary recent drop in the Japanese yen, we used the prior 30-day average exchange rate of JPY 86 to $1 in creating our guidance for Q2 through Q4. For Q1, we are using a spot rate of JPY 89 to $1. All other currencies were translated using current rates. Using these assumptions, full year currency translation is expected to be neutral to sales growth while depressing earnings per share by $0.10 in 2013 versus 2012.","Moving down the P&L. Gross margins are expected to be about 59.5%, a modest decline due largely to the currency effects I just described. Operating expenses are expected to be up between 3% and 4% from 2012. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million. We currently expect our full year operating tax rate to be about 15.5%. The expected tax rate will vary by quarter as we account for the R&D tax credit recently reinstated by Congress in Q1. Our tax rate in Q1 is expected to be approximately 14%, and for Qs 2 through 4, are expected to be about 16%. Our full year average diluted share count is likely to be around 85.5 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of this together, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.40.","As we think about our expectations for the first quarter of 2013, we expect organic sales growth of about 4% in the first quarter. Currency translation at today's rates will reduce sales by almost 1%, resulting in reported sales growth of about 3%. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.12.","Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Operator, I think at this point, we can open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Doug and John, you've discussed throughout the call an increasing kind of tone of business possibly as, I guess, we exited the quarter. I think Doug, you talked about an ordering trend in high-end mass spec. Maybe if you could just flesh out a little bit kind of the pacing throughout the quarter that you saw and maybe some of this kind of forward visibility on improving demand trends.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, Dan. I think most of it's qualitative. And I caution everybody to say that it doesn't necessarily reflect longer term trends. We definitely saw an improvement in the fourth quarter in both the drop rate of high-end mass spec and more qualitative things, like demo requests and quotes. So that we see as positive. We see that continuing in the early part of 2013. We're also hearing what I call murmurings of improvement coming from our customer base. What makes it remarkable or notable is that it's different from what we were seeing at this time last year, which was much more cautious. So it's pretty much across the board that we're seeing those qualitative comments as being -- as leading to more optimism than pessimism. Does that cover your question, Dan?","Operator","We can go to the next question. Amit Bhalla of Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. I guess, number one, Doug, can you just talk a little bit about the outlook by regions and end markets for 2013? What's the underlying assumptions within the guidance you laid out? And then I have a follow-up question on India.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure, I'll ask John to lay it out. He's got the data right here.","John A. Ornell","Yes, I think as we think about the full year and look at the geographies around the world, the expectation is that developing economies, largely Asia outside of Japan, portions of Eastern Europe, South America, Central America areas that we typically bring in to about the 30% that we talked about as being our emerging market exposure, we're looking for that to continue at kind of a high single-digit rate. We've seen that be better generally than that in actual results, but we tend to target something that's in the high single digits for those regions of the world. And then in areas such as U.S. and Europe, given the base of comparison that we have, we're looking for low single-digit growth this year in those parts of the world, maybe starting off closer to 2% and then closer to 3.5% perhaps. And then Japan, we're looking for a bit more of a difficult slog there, maybe 1% or 2% growth in that region. So that's kind of the outlook by geography.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the end markets? And then I guess, I'll just throw in my India question. You had some pretty easy fourth quarter comps in the prior year. You're talking about some CRO issues. Can you flesh India out a little bit more in terms of the details of what's really happening there?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, I think what we've talked continuously about in India is that these customers are facing weaker rupee issues, wherein they're challenged by both the capital requests, as well as financing issues, that most of their debt's denominated in stronger currencies, and that challenges their ability to aggressively spend new capital. They've also had regulatory issues that have made them cautious in certain areas. We can pretty much look at almost every item that comes into India in terms of the market share dynamics, and we're convinced that there's no significant market share erosion going on in our business in India. So I know this is getting to be a little bit of a broken record; we're pretty confident that it's going to change. We're not happy that it's taken longer than we expected, but we think we'll see a change in 2013 and we'll see positive results in India.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And the question on the end markets?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm sorry, what was that question?","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The original question was your underlying assumptions on geographies and end markets. I didn't hear anything on end markets.","John A. Ornell","We're looking at pharma to grow kind of in the mid single-digit range. It could be, maybe 6% -- so closer to 6% than 5%. Government and academic, kind of flat, maybe a modest amount of growth as we exit the year but starting off slow. And then the applied markets, including food, environmental, industrial, somewhere in kind of the 3% to 4% range.","Operator","Our next question does come from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The first one was just on UPLC. I'm wondering if you could maybe give us an update on where we are, and we're a few years into that product cycle, and wondering how you're measuring the penetration of that technology from an installed base perspective. And then maybe if you could offer some comments on what you're seeing on consumable attach rates.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, I think we're very happy with the penetration of UPLC in almost all the early stage R&D segments of our market. I will say that it's taken longer to penetrate, although we are beginning to see penetration in downstream applications, particularly in pharma, particularly in mainstream QC. We certainly continue to hear our customers talk aggressively about taking UPLC into those applications. But frankly, up until this time, it's probably been a little more talk than action. We think that has a lot to do with the fact that capital is tough to come by and that it's just tougher to get capital in those large pharma applications. It is true that we're seeing a lot of success in penetration of UPLC in the generic drug manufacturers, and we think that that's a continuing dynamic that will continue to benefit us. In terms of attachment rates, we're happy with the continued strong attachment rates of consumables even at this phase, many years down the track, that we continue to see very high attachment rates of the UPLC consumables. It is true that since we sell braces of these columns with a new instrument placement, that because of the decline in instrument placements that we saw during this year, that that certainly affected to some extent the initial flow of our UPLC columns. But they still held up very nicely in each application.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if I can just clarify what you said, it sounded like you were saying we're still maybe not quite halfway through the upgrade cycle on the equipment. Just -- I didn't want to put words in your mouth, but just making sure that's kind of the way you're framing it. And then last one for me was on longer-term tax planning. John, I think you guys have said in the past you have a tax shield I think in Singapore that expires in the near term. Anyway, just plans on what you plan to do there to offset it?","John A. Ornell","Yes, we're going to begin to look at options on that front that runs out 3 years or so down the road. So we'll start this year to think about what incremental product transfers maybe could be done to extend our benefit in Singapore. This -- we can think about what we might do in Ireland as well, incrementally from where we are today. The new product lines that we're developing on convergence chromatography might find a home over in those regions of the world. That might be a bargaining chip that we could use to move another piece of technology and gain something incremental on that front. So you'll hear more about that as we begin to work through that this year in anticipation of that benefit running out at the end of '15.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We think that we have any number of irons in this fire that will enable us to not see extraordinary increases on our effective tax rate even 4 or 5 years down the road, but those are actions that will play out in the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question does come from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","John, you talked a little bit about the long-term guidance being in effect, and are you referring to the kind of 8% long-term top line and 15% bottom line internal targets that you set for yourself? And if so, what do you see changing about the current environment that would kind of allow you to get back to that level?","John A. Ornell","Well, I think we look at this year certainly as a transition year from a very low-growth environment that is really a point off the line, certainly, from a history perspective, looking at where we've been and where we think we're going. We look at the opportunity that we have with some of the new products that we currently have in our portfolio, others that are coming into play that we think longer-term will add to the growth rate. And we don't believe that the economic environment that we live in today is the one that we're going to live in for the future, 2 , 3, 4 years out. So we do think that we're going to come back to some level of moderating demand in various markets that affords us the opportunity to grow somewhere closer to that 7%, 8% top line as we exit this year and move into next year. So we believe that there's incremental application opportunities for these products, maybe in clinical. We look at the biologically synthesized drugs in the drug pipeline, and think that there's opportunities to, perhaps, overtime introduce mass spectrometry into the QA\/QC applications, new food safety opportunities in the States. So there's a myriad of both potential market opportunities that we think longer term allows us to get back to those 7%, 8% top line-type growth numbers that typically have leverage to about 15% growth in earnings.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. We think pretty clearly that we're coming off a period of -- at least a year, maybe longer than that -- of some of the toughest macroeconomic conditions and some things that disproportionately hurt areas in our sweet spot. We just talked a lot about India, and India alone has cost us several points of growth in the last 1.5 years. So it's easy to kind of look at the well you're down at any particular point, and think the future's always going to kind of mimic that position. We think that for the most part, we're going to be coming out of these tougher market conditions and going into a more normal position, particularly more normal in some of our sweet customer spots.","Operator","Our next question does come from Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Question on the gross margin guidance. Is there anything happening in the gross margin line besides foreign currency? I just would have thought that there would have been some more leverage off of a 5% organic growth expectation on the gross margin line.","John A. Ornell","Yes, that's a good question. And there is one other item that we've highlighted, and that is, is that this year, we're beginning to ship the -- some of the fuller capabilities of our UNIFI software platform, and that is triggering the beginnings of meaningful amortization of capitalized software. So this year, we have about a $10 million to $11 million increment in costs associated with that amortization that's impacting the gross margins as well. Because, otherwise, we would have seen a little bit less of an impact overall in the margin. So between that $11 million and a very unfavorable yen, they combined to provide what's there on -- what I've described.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That is a non-cash charge, but it still is reflected in our non-GAAP earnings.","John A. Ornell","Right, non-GAAP results. Right.","Operator","Our next question does come from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering what levers are available for you to pull at the operating line if things get off to a slower-than-expected start this year? I mean, I guess, I'm just thinking about SG&A as a percentage of sales being down about 180 basis points versus where you were into 2009. The rate of growth in R&D spend really moderated in 2012. You just talked about your longer-term expectations of 7% to 8% top line growth in response to Tim's questions. I guess I'm just wondering how much more you'd be willing to cut in 2013 if you get off to a slower-than-expected start out of the gates. And then conversely, are there areas you've identified where you'd really like to pick up the pace of investment if the year gets off to a better-than-expected start?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think -- let me say, Doug, that we have some ability to moderate our spending plans in the face of somewhat weaker conditions. I wouldn't have you believe that we can cut expenses dramatically in the face of a very significant shortfall on revenues. That's why we have looked very hard at our plan for revenue growth, and believe that we can get there because, of course, our spending plans have triggered off that revenue estimate. But we have some flexibility. We have some minor headcount plans, and we have compensation plans that can be tweaked to make up for some reduction. It would take a longer term -- if we see that the longer-term is more unfavorable than we currently believe, that would take us really considering changing the structure of our business. It's doable, but it would take a belief that we don't have right now about the longer-term health of our end markets and we think -- well, it's conceivable that it starts a little bit slower, we don't think that that's what we have in mind for the full year 2013. So -- and is there -- was there another part to...","John A. Ornell","Yes, areas that we might invest in. Was that the other piece, Doug?","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's right, John.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, we've never -- let me restate it. We think that we're investing at the proper pace, given the projects and the opportunities that we have and we don't -- we haven't cut out major projects in R&D in order to protect the bottom line. So within the normal give and take of projects and criticisms of plans and plans that are ahead of schedule and a few that are behind, we're reasonably happy with the mix of programs that we have. I wouldn't say really that if we had an extra $5 million to spend, there's something that crawls up onto the A list. I think we're pretty happy with what we've got going and yes, I suppose you could always use an extra $0.5 million or so. We're in pretty good shape.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick one and then I'll get back in the queue. A quick one for John. Did you provide guidance specifically on your expectation for instrument versus recurring revenue growth this year? And if you did, I apologize for missing it. If not, would you provide that?","John A. Ornell","Yes, I'd say you've seen relatively consistent growth in service and chemistry revenues across this year, being a very difficult year. So we see that pace continuing. So something in the kind of the 7%-ish range, all in, for those couple of businesses seems reasonable. And then the instrument piece maybe starts off just slightly slower at the start of the year, but for the full year is somewhere around kind of 3%, I would say.","Operator","Our next question does come from Paul Knight of CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","On the food safety testing market that you mentioned was stronger, do you think that's due to the 2 rules out for review on the Food Safety Act? Or is it kind of business growth as usual and we might see acceleration later?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I don't think we've seen anything really coming out of the act yet, Paul. The -- it's still in its infancy, really, and it might be that in the end, it directs more towards imports and it has an effect outside of the U.S. as much as inside. So I think the full effect of that's going to come in the future. I don't think we've seen much impact of it so far.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Were you able to quantify how much food safety is of sales?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm sorry, how much food safety is...","John A. Ornell","What percent?","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Do you think food safety's 5%, 10% or what percent of sales?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","It's about 6% or 7% of sales.","Operator","Our next question does come from Ross Muken of ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I have 2 quick things. So one on the instrument line. The 3% number that you threw out there, John, basically sort of offset the weakness from this year and so, ultimately, the business would not be growing very much since '11. And so, I guess, you look back historically, most times over the course of the cycle, where you've kind of had a pull back in CapEx, we've sort of seen a reasonable recovery on that line in the following year. So I guess, what, other than sort of the macro, would make that not be true this time around, particularly given some of the comps you have on the generics business, which I'm assuming accounted for a decent amount of the weakness?","John A. Ornell","That is a good question, Ross, and I'll say there is potentially some level of optimism that could suggest that that turns out to be the case. I think, though, that as we start the year and think about a -- hopefully something, leaning towards conservative view of the world, coming up with a growth rate that really just brings us back to flat is probably a realistic point of view that maybe has a little more upside than down as the year goes on. But I think just from creating guidance and trying to provide a little more pleasure than pain when doing that, we just felt uncomfortable, suggesting that we were just going to bounce back all in the course of 1 year to do exactly what you're describing. I agree, if you look back historically at times when it's been tougher, almost always, the next year bounce back -- bounces back pretty meaningfully. But we're going to leave that potential as upside, and hopefully paint a view here that feels very realistic to begin the year.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","And Ross, I think it's also true that as you go down our organization, right down to the field level, you'll see much more of that attitude reflected in their expectations, and what they're driving to, that there's really a point of view that says this year could be significantly better. But when you roll it up through the levels of review and you look at the issues from macroeconomic disappointment, I agree with John. It's more prudent to enter the year on a more cautious plan than have to really gear it down later on.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, what was contemplated in the guidance for kind of the macro acceleration? The market as a whole seems a lot more optimistic, and you can argue we've gone through these the last few years. But I think there's some reasons to believe as long as you're up, sort of stabilized and China accelerates, we will see a better CapEx environment. So I guess, what did you actually factor into that forecast? Is it sort of 1Q trends and then a modest amount of improvement? I'm just trying to get the sense for how much...","John A. Ornell","I mean, we're basically saying that Q1 looks kind of like the last 4 quarters that we've seen, really not a lot of improvement coming right out of the gate. But I think it's fair to say that we think on the CapEx side, when you look at instruments, people will begin to feel better about spending capital as demand maybe improves a bit within their business, and maybe we see GDP in various regions of the world pick up a point or 1.5 points as the year goes on and we begin to see people feel better about spending CapEx. As we look at the operating side of what people do, we've seen relatively decent growth in our recurring revenues. We think that continues. It's the willingness of people to -- our customers to spend capital and we think that that gets incrementally better as we make our way through the quarters, but we're not factoring in getting back to normal, I guess, on that front.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","It's definitely true that one of the areas that we're most challenged on in 2012 was the industrial segment of the marketplace, particularly, industrial chemical firms, and that was true worldwide. Certainly, there's a case to be made for that segment of the marketplace to be stronger, and we also think we've got some dynamite systems coming onstream this year that addresses those customer needs. So if you compound that good feeling, you can get more enthusiastic than what we're willing to commit to now. But we're coming off a disappointing period, and it's still, I think, right to be more cautious at this point in the game.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Fine. One last thing. Just, John, remind me, the comp in India in Q1 versus what we just saw in Q4, how much easier is that?","John A. Ornell","Yes, it was down meaningfully in Q1 last year. I don't have that specific number right in front of me, Ross, but the comp is definitely easier in Q1 than it was in Q4, and we're somewhat optimistic that we're starting off a bit better as we look at India coming out of the gate.","Operator","Our next question does come from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So could you just talk a little bit about the differences you saw in U.S. versus European pharma in the quarter? Also, just U.S. and European academic. And what, if anything, did you get from a budget flush this quarter?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","John, you want to...","John A. Ornell","Yes. Large pharma -- as we saw in Q3, the large pharma actually did better in Europe than they did in the states. We continue to see a little bit of bias at some of these accounts to spend money in Europe. So it was a little bit of a continuation of that trend. But I'd say between the two, we're not dramatically off from original expectation, and I wouldn't draw the long-term conclusion from what we've seen there. But overall, large pharma did about what we thought, but was, again, bias to Europe. I'd say government and academic really probably continues to do just a little better than we think, than we originally had thought. We really don't see these markets reacting dramatically to the fear of major budget cuts. I mean, when and if they come, and I'm sure we'll see them and life will be different. Fortunately, as you know, our exposure there isn't as great as it is in the space. But we really haven't seen any major reaction in government academic accounts at this stage that would suggest that they're acting ahead of time to cuts that may be coming their way.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just one quick question, on the UNIFI system that you're launching. Can you just give us a recap on where you sort of are on the broad of that? And the -- obviously, you're capitalizing a lot of the software this year. But could you just give us a recap on that program, and what do you -- I mean, how do you think you see it driving growth?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure. I mean, as most everybody knows, UNIFI is really the culmination of a multi-year effort on our part that really brings all of the disparate software systems that we had in place under one operating system that we, of course, called UNIFI. This was a huge program, and we chose to introduce elements of it earlier. The first elements went in earlier last year with specific systems, particularly bioanalytical software. As we go through this year and into next year, we're really bringing the full chromatography and mass spectrometry elements of this system to the marketplace. So because only very small portions of it were introduced last year, you didn't see the full elements of the financial amortization. This year, as it comes into play, you're going to see that come through the P&L. I will say this is another area where I think we're being conservative in terms of the effect on our overall business because this is a major change in the facility of this software into our customers' applications, and we think, over time, this is going to have a dramatic impact and improvement. We're being cautious, once again, I think, about the early uptake and how it affects our business. But that's why you're seeing this come in a more significant amortization mode as we enter 2013.","Operator","Our next question does come from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Doug, just on India, what are the signs you're seeing for a better India, you think, for 2013?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, we're seeing earlier orders activity come to fruition, Peter. We continue to see -- to talk to these customers and to hear their plans, and they continue to be aggressive plans. So we see nothing that says -- if anything, here is one specific area where we think there's pent-up replacement [indiscernible] restrained activity in the past that should manifest itself in higher activities going forward. So in both the generic and in the food area, we're seeing much interest, much quote activity, and we've always believed that this market really is committed to the long-term servicing of the generic drug business, and see nothing that's going to move them on. As they come through this period, they'll resolve the currency issues. They're resolving the regulatory issues, and I think they're ready to move ahead.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And you don't think there could be any share losses during this period for you?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm always unwilling to speak definitively about short-term market share dynamics, but India's one market where all of the equipment really comes in from outside the country, and that data is all public. So we monitor that kind of data, and see no fundamental changes in market share going on in our chromatography world.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And just one last question for John around the uptick in R&D in the quarter. I may have missed this. Is that just associated with the U.K. mass spectrometry coming online, and does that carry through for 2013?","John A. Ornell","Yes, we have a lot of projects spent, and the project activities can move the needle in R&D a few points one way or the other. We've got the new UltraPerformance systems that are taking a little bit more effort in R&D. But I would say that, generally, it's project spent that can be lumpy quarter-by-quarter. Convergence chromatography is the product that we've traditionally spent some R&D dollars on. And we have a host of new products that we'll talk about as the year goes on that we're readying right now for Pittcon and in ASMS that are in a stage now that requires a bit more project spend as well. So it tends to be a little bit lumpy. I wouldn't draw that -- take that 5% and suggest that that's what it has to be into the next 4 quarters, but I'm comfortable thinking the expenses there is in that 3% to 4% growth range that I described earlier.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","But that's a little bit higher in 1Q. I guess that flows over into 1Q.","John A. Ornell","A little bit. The other thing to think about there is the British pound. There is some amount of translation that occurs there so you got to keep an eye on that. I don't know that it was a major impact in Q4, but we do have probably 1\/4 to 1\/3 of our spend that is in Manchester U.K. that does impact that line too.","Operator","Dan Arias of UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just on China, it sounds like things are continuing to be pretty strong there. Can you just touch on demand with respect to life sciences versus more industrially-focused work? How do things look there when you parse those 2 applications out?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, sure. China, interestingly enough, is a pretty balanced market for us. Whereas India is heavily weighted towards generics, China is more balanced between pharma, bio pharm, food and industrial. And our results in China have been strong in all of those, in both the overall pharmaceutical market and the applied segments. So we continue to see just very good growth across those segments.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a question on chemistry. Doug, you talked about the potential for some new LC introductions later this year. So I guess, how important is new column development to grow for you guys? And to the extent that maybe you do bring some new chemistries to market, should we think about there being any margin benefit to those aimed at more protein-based work? Or is that not really something that impacts profitability?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, chemistry is a very profitable segment of our business so it's always something that's worth noting. I do think that there's no significant platform introduction of a new chemistry this year. There are subsegments of our chemistry line, certainly, in our new UPC2 technology, and we have some new offerings in the life science arena, particularly dealing with peptides. There are probably things you'd consider niche offerings. Our whole chemistry line to some extent is made up of a bunch of profitable niches, so it's wrapped up in the numbers that John talked about. I don't think that I'd point you towards anything that's likely to move that needle tremendously in the chemistry area. It's the kind of thing where you wake up 2 or 3 years down the road and you've got a new $10 million or $15 million platform, but it takes a while to build.","Operator","Our next question does come from Tycho Peterson of JPMC.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. I wanted to go back to the comments you made earlier on the academic markets. You talked about them being fairly stable here. I know in the past, you've recently talked about potentially some share gains at the high end of the market, in particular, within this triple quad business. So in your assumptions here, are you factoring in some share shift? Or is it just more of general stability in the end markets?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Tycho, in the triple quad area, that's not typically the academic market. I mean, we're talking about the pharmaceutical and the applied markets that's the biggest segment for the tandem quadrupoles. The government and the university market tends to be more of the high-end top business that we're doing there, so...","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. Are you factoring share gains there though?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think 2012 in that high-end mass spec area was a tough time for us. We see that moderating a little bit in the fourth quarter and we think that that's a better place in 2013. Again, share gains are something that it's awfully fluid, but I think we're more confident about our business position and positive results in 2013 than we saw in 2012.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on Japan, you talked about expecting a rebound there, I think, in part driven by currency. Can you just talk to the budget dynamics there? Obviously, in the March fiscal year, do you expect some budget flush this quarter? And do you expect any change in the academic funding environment there, post-March?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I would say we see -- we anticipate consistent dynamics against what happened in the prior year happening this year, but that's not for a robust growth in Japan. We do think that, consistent with the better economic expectations for the industrial markets, Japan has a significant industrial segment of the market. So as that becomes more competitive, we think that we'll do better. John, did you want to add anything to that?","John A. Ornell","Yes, from the review that we had on Japan, I would say that the likely scenario is that we see a little bit better government budget in Qs 2 through 4 as they enter the next plan year, but nothing that moves us more than 1% in growth. So I mean we're looking at a business that might go from kind of flattish to up 1% or 2%. A lot of that's really just based on comparison.","Operator","Next question does come from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just a quick question for me, either John or Doug, on this -- I want to make sure [indiscernible]. On the tax kind of restructuring that you announced, does that have any impact in your ability to repatriate cash and be more aggressive on your buyback?","John A. Ornell","No, unfortunately, this was a Europe restructuring. And while it creates some efficiency there and allows us to prevent tax payments from going up over the next 10 years, it doesn't have any bearing on the repatriation.","Operator","Our next question does come from Sung Ji Nam of Cantor.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have a one quick one. Could you -- John, you talked about incremental growth opportunities in clinical diagnostics. Could you maybe talk about kind of what you're strategies are near-term and what your competitive advantages might be compared to others in this market?","John A. Ornell","Well, I would say -- we were talking earlier about the tandem quadrupole. That is an instrument that does fit nicely into this space. So I think we do currently have a very high performance offering out there. We've got a decent footprint that exists in that space. We have a crew here that are looking at potential incremental opportunities on that front. So I would say it is a sector we pay attention to. I think over the long run, there will be some interesting niche opportunities for mass spectrometry to do things that, today -- what chemistry tests are either inefficient or you have to wait too long for the answer. And we'll find some interesting applications over a longer period of time, and we continue to invest in that and think that we have a great offering and continue to -- we'll continue to deploy it this year and beyond.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, we're very optimistic about it. We had a good end of the year in our clinical business, and that might be one area where we see some unlooked for upside in 2013. We've got a lot of interest going using these new technologies in a clinical testing area, and we think that has a robust future.","All right, operator, I think at this point, it's appropriate to bring it to a close.","Operator","Thank you.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference call begins. This conference call is being recorded. If anyone have objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Bryan Brokmeier, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bryan Brokmeier","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full-year 2019.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for July 30, 2019.","During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the mostly directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning.","In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.","Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris O'Connell, Waters' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Bryan. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, I will provide an overview of our first quarter operating results as well as some broader commentary on our markets and business. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our second quarter and full-year 2019 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.","Sales in the first quarter fell well short of our expectations. Total revenue was flat, which drove adjusted earnings per share growth of 1%. This result was unexpected given the momentum we saw in Q4 of 2018 and reflected greater-than-expected macro impacts in China and Europe as well as a slow release of budgets by key pharmaceutical and industrial customers.","To give you a bit more color on the first quarter's challenges, I'd like to comment on the three factors that constituted the majority of our shortfall against our expectations: China, Europe, and TA Instruments.","Starting with China, I'd like to first give some important context for our business in that country. China is 18% of our global business and has reliably delivered strong double-digit growth for an extended period of time.","Our business mix in China is unique within our global portfolio, as well as the industry, with pharma representing approximately 50% of our revenue and food testing representing over 15%.","In the first quarter, our business in China declined 4%, which was primarily the result of the ongoing restructure of the government's food safety infrastructure, as well as the 4+7 policy impacting our generic pharmaceutical customers' capital purchasing.","While we were aware of the policy changes referenced, we had not seen an adverse impact from them in 2018 and their Q1 2019 impact was more pronounced than we expected.","On the positive side, Chinese customer utilization remains strong and we expect end-market improvement throughout the year and a return to growth.","Furthermore, we continue to view China as a sustainable growth driver for the company and remain confident in our strong market position.","The government reforms that I mentioned are intended to strengthen economic growth as China transforms from a manufacturing export economy into a local innovation economy where the food and pharmaceutical industries will be key beneficiaries. As such, we expect to benefit from these reforms even if we experience short-term volatility during these implementation phases.","Turning to Europe, our business declined 5% in the quarter as customers were cautious in their Q1 purchasing decisions amid uncertainty with macroeconomic conditions, including the ongoing Brexit political stalemate.","This caution negatively impacted capital spending decisions by our largest pharma and industrial customers, particularly in Western Europe. On a positive note, our academic and governmental category in Europe saw continued strength.","Despite the Q1 capital purchasing dynamics, our pharmaceutical demo and quoting activity are strong, which indicate that demand in our European pharmaceutical business should improve over the course of the year.","Third, our TA product line experienced a soft start to the year with sales down 8% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2018. TA's purchasing weakness was seen across most geographies and product categories, but most notably felt in Europe due largely to the macroeconomic headwinds I referenced earlier.","Despite the slow start to 2019, we anticipate that TA will return to growth as customers\u2019 budgets are released over the course of the year and we are confident in our strong global TA team.","Additionally, we expect to continue to benefit from our robust TA product position as we are relatively early in the broader commercialization cycle of our Discovery line of thermal analyzers and growing line of accessories.","Turning briefly to a few high level comments on the income statement, our modest earnings-per-share growth reflected the lower-than-anticipated first quarter sales. We were pleased with our disciplined operating expense control, while continuing to invest in our key growth initiatives.","Notably, our cash flow conversion remained at historically high levels, evidencing our robust business model and supporting our capital deployment plans.","Taking a closer look at the business, starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category were flat in the quarter.","Demand from customers in large molecule applications and biomedical research was strong, offset by slower-than-expected budget releases by our largest pharmaceutical customers as well as by generic manufacturers in China and the US.","We continue to feel good about our strong positioning in targeted LC-MS and biopharmaceutical analytical solutions, as well as the durability of our franchise in small molecule testing.","Additionally, we are encouraged by our return to growth in India as the generic pharmaceutical customer base showed improving sentiment.","Sales to our worldwide industrial category, which includes the material science, food and environmental markets, declined 2% during the quarter. This decline was most notable in the material science and food markets, reflecting the previously described macro conditions in China and Europe.","Despite softer-than-expected growth during the quarter, we remain confident in our industrial product positions and pipeline as well as the breadth of opportunities across material science, food safety, and environmental applications.","Looking at our academic and governmental category, sales grew 4% in the first quarter with strong growth in the US and Europe, partially offset by the earlier-described weakness in the China food sector.","Our recent success in this category reflects the continuing healthy pace of global innovation, particularly in pharmaceutical discovery.","Next, I will review our sales performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest region in terms of growth \u2013 in terms of revenue, excuse me, grew 2% in the first quarter as our aforementioned weakness in China offset solid growth in India, Japan, and Korea. We are encouraged by the mid-single digit Q1 growth in India and remain cautiously optimistic about improving trends.","Turning to the Americas, overall sales were flat in the quarter, while sales in the US grew 2%. Solid growth in both our US industrial and academic and governmental categories offset softness in pharma, which was largely due to slower-than-expected release of capital budgets by our largest customers.","Despite the slower start in the quarter, we believe the US pharmaceutical environment remains healthy and we've seen this Q1 dynamic before.","In Europe, sales were down 5% in the quarter, in particular, the industrial category was a drag on the region, while academic and governmental demand remained robust.","Within pharma, we saw strength in large molecule applications, offset by weaker demand in small molecule applications in our large pharma customers.","Finally, I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instrument sales were down 4% in the first quarter as a result of the previously mentioned headwinds in China and Europe.","LC reflected the aforementioned weakness in generic demand in China and the slower budget releases in the US and Europe, partially offset by encouraging strength of our LC business in India.","We remain confident in our global LC franchise which is characterized by instrument and chemistry leadership, a strong installed base and the industry standard chromatography data system.","Looking to mass spectrometry, our business in Q1 faced modest pressure, but we are seeing improved demand for our high-resolution mass spec portfolio.","Additionally, we are pleased with the BioAccord launch process and early market development activity. This simple, robust, fit-for-purpose, LC-MS solution is the first mover in a new biopharmaceutical category that will change the way customers characterize and monitor large molecule therapeutics.","Since our launch in January, we've seen a high level of interest from both existing and new customers. Systems have been shipped and we are building a robust demo and quoting pipeline. I look forward to updating you further on BioAccord as we progress through the year.","Waters branded recurring revenues, which reflect the combination of service and precision chemistries, grew 4% in the quarter. Recurring revenues were driven by the stability of our large and established installed base of instruments, as well as the global strength in our service plans, ACQUITY UPLC columns, bioseparation columns and chemistry application kits.","Turning to our TA product line, we experienced a slow start to 2019 across most geographies and product categories, particularly in Europe due to a very slow Q1 budget release.","Earlier this year at Pittcon, we introduced a number of new TA products, including the Discovery Thermal Mechanical Analyzer TMA 450, which is setting a new industry standard by providing information about a materials coefficient of linear thermal expansion, shrinkage, softening and glass transition temperatures.","Returning to the big picture, we remain steadfastly focused on executing against our five-point value creation model. As we consistently communicate, we aim to create shareholder value by first holding this leading position \u2013 specialty position in structurally attractive markets; number two, executing a focused growth strategy driven by organic innovation; third, seeking opportunities for continuous operational improvement in innovation, channel and operations; fourth, maintaining capital discipline as we shift from being a capital accumulator to a capital deployer; and fifth, operating with a performance-oriented culture and management team.","I would like to thank everyone who attended our biennial Investor Day held in February. For those who were not able to attend, I'd like to highlight three key takeaways from that meeting.","First, Waters has a very unique global franchise defined by our specialty positioning. Second, the increased investment and product development progress that we've made in the past few years now places us squarely in front of an exciting multiyear product cycle. And third, US tax reform enabled a paradigm shift for Waters in giving us access to our significant global cash flow and, therefore, we will deploy more capital more assertively to growth initiatives, achieve a more optimal capital structure and return more capital to shareholders.","Furthermore, during the meeting, we introduced a couple of additional members of our management team which reinforced the confidence I have in the great depth and quality of our leadership and talent pipeline.","In summary, sales in the first quarter fell well short of our expectations. This result was unexpected, given the momentum we saw in Q4 of 2018 and reflected greater-than-expected macro impacts in China and Europe, as well as the slow release of budgets by key pharmaceutical and industrial customers.","For context, Q1 is traditionally our smallest quarter and not necessarily predictive of how the year will shape up. As such, while our guidance now reflects a more cautious view of the macroenvironment, we do expect improving growth over the course of 2019.","We remain confident in our strong market position, underlying customer activity and the contribution of new product introductions across our portfolio already underway and planned for 2019.","Longer-term, our key growth drivers remain intact, including a global pharmaceutical demand, strength in our Asian markets, and an overall robust business model that includes consistent and highly-profitable recurring revenues.","With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry for a deeper review of our first quarter financials. Sherry?","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $514 million, which is flat against the prior-year in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 3%, resulting in a 3% decline as reported.","During the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical markets were flat. Our industrial category declined 2% and sales into our academic and governmental category grew 4%. ","Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of service and precision chemistries, grew 4% in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 6%.","As we noted on our last earnings call, recurring sales during the first quarter of 2019 were impacted by one less calendar day in the quarter, which resulted in a slight reduction in recurring revenues.","Looking ahead, there's no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters, but there is one additional calendar day in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2018.","Breaking first quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services grew 1%, while sales of TA-branded products and services declined 8%.","Combined, LC and LC-MS instrument platform sales declined by 4% and TA's instrument sales declined by 12%.","Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 2% despite a 4% decline in China, while sales in the Americas were flat with 2% growth in the US and European sales were down 5%.","Now, I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 57% compared to 58.3% in the first quarter of 2018. The lower gross margin relative to the prior-year quarter was driven by mix and lower fixed cost absorption.","Moving down the first quarter P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 2% on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation decreased operating expense growth by approximately 4% on a reported basis.","In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was about 11%, consistent with prior year. Net interest expense was $3.2 million, down about $1 million from the prior year, benefiting from reduced debt levels.","Our average share count came in at 72.4 million shares, a share count reduction of approximately 9% or about 7 million shares lower than in the first quarter of last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased to $1.60 in comparison to $1.59 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $1.51 compared to $1.40 last year.","A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning.","Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our first quarter results and activities.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items.","In the first quarter of 2019, free cash flow came in at $158 million after funding $16 million [ph] of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $7 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation.","In the first quarter, this resulted in $0.31 as each dollar sales converted into free cash flow. ","Now, I'd like to provide an update on our first quarter activities related to capital deployment, which we categorize into three areas \u2013 investing for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility, and the return of capital to shareholders.","During the quarter, R&D grew 4% on a constant currency basis. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased 3.3 million shares of our common stock for $745 million in the first quarter.","These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow, resulted in cash and short-term investments of $1.2 billion and debt of $1.2 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, resulting in a roughly net neutral cash position.","Looking ahead, we remain committed to deploying capital against these three priorities and continue working towards a near-term capital structure of up to 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA ratio.","Our current plans are to repurchase approximately $600 million in shares during the second quarter, and consistent with our previous communications, about $2.5 million for the full year. These assumptions are reflected in our 2019 guidance.","We will evaluate our share repurchase plans over the course of the year and provide quarterly updates.","Turning to working capital, accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 88 days this quarter, up slightly compared to the first quarter of last year due to the timing of sales and currency translation.","In the quarter, inventories increased by $33 million in comparison to the prior-year quarter, which reflects some anticipated inventory build due to Brexit-related contingency planning and lower-than-expected sales in the quarter.","As we look forward to the balance of the year, I'd like to comment on our full-year 2019 guidance. While we are confident in our market position and new product pipeline, we are tempering this with appropriate caution due to the factors that affected the first quarter.","As a result, we are reducing our full-year 2019 guidance for constant currency sales growth to a range of 2% to 4% from our prior guidance range of 4% to 6%. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to decrease 2019 sales growth by 1 to 2 percentage points.","Gross margin guidance for the full year is 58.5% to 59% from our prior guidance of approximately 59%.","Our other key assumptions for full-year guidance are unchanged. Operating expense growth at a rate that is below our sales growth rate, net interest expense of $30 million to $35 million, full-year effective tax rate of 14% to 15%.","We anticipate that better-than-expected tax rate in the first quarter will be offset by higher rates of the remaining quarters of the year.","And lastly, an average diluted share count 68.5 to 69 million shares outstanding.","Rolling all of this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2019 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.05 to $9.25, a decrease from our prior range of $9.20 to $9.45.","At current rates, the negative currency impact on full-year earnings per share growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points.","Looking at the second quarter of 2019, we expect 2% to 4% constant currency sales growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to decrease second quarter sales growth by 1 to 2 percentage points.","Combining these top line factors with a moderate increase in expenses, we estimate second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share in the range of $2.05 to $2.15. At current rates, the negative currency impact on second-quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Chris for some summary comments. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Thank you, Sherry. As we move through 2019, we will stay focused on our innovation strategy and commercial execution across the business.","As I stated before, we did not meet our expectations in the first quarter. We understand the causes and are focused on delivering improved growth over the course of the year. ","With that, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not always able to get to everyone's questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Waters investor relations team after the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. The first question in the queue is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. I'd love to dig a little bit more into the China side of things. I know you called out the generic piece. Obviously, we know about the major restructuring there. I guess, as you get a sense on timing, how long do you think that will take to kind of unwind itself? And then, relative to the food side as well, one of your key competitors there has talked about sort of disruption for the better part of the last several quarters. You had sort of held in better and now, obviously, you saw a bit of weakness. I guess, how are you thinking about also a bit of unwind in that, given sort of the long-term trend still should be pretty favorable in that business?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. Thanks, Ross. Appreciate the question. And I agree with your last comment there that the long-term trend in both the food and the pharma businesses is structurally attractive. And we certainly have seen a gyration in these markets in the past. Although, as you know, China has been a very, very steady contributor to Waters. In fact, nine of the last 10 years here at Waters, China has been a double-digit grower.","In terms of the unwind of those two factors, starting with the food side, as you recall from other market activity, the restructuring of the food government processes is something that really began in the earlier part of last year and had about a one-year lifecycle.","During the course of 2018, we saw a relatively stable demand because a lot of the capital purchases on the food side that had been committed at the beginning of the year, we saw mostly hold through the year. And so, this particular initiative didn't really affect us that much in 2018, but clearly affected us in the first quarter.","We do see the evolution of that process maturing in the first through second quarter here. We do expect some ongoing caution but, over time, that's the really important priority for the Chinese government to invest in food safety testing. And as you pointed out, it's a market that we all expect to return to growth.","From the standpoint of the pharma situation, with the 4+7 initiative, which is really a centralized bulk purchasing pilot process, we have seen early in this year some meaningful hold on capital spending. But I will point out that underlying activity remains reasonably robust. We actually had a strong growth in chemistry during the quarter that reflects the underlying testing activity among pharma and generic pharma type of companies that are, in particular, affected by the 4+7 policy.","So, all in all, these macro factors definitely hit us harder than we expected. And as a result of that, we have lowered expectations as reflected in our guidance. But we do expect that to moderate over the course of the year, expect modest improvement and a return to growth, albeit more modest growth in China than we're typically accustomed to in this fiscal year. But, certainly, I have a lot of faith in the strength of our team and our market share position that has been always a source of strength and we expect we will continue to be so looking forward.","Ross Muken","And then, maybe just in terms of like the execution cadence, looking at kind of Q4 now, though in Q1, it was obviously a pretty substantial outperformance at some businesses. TA had huge sequential uptick in Q4 from Q3. And then, obviously, we saw a downtick in Q1 and a bit of that also on the Waters Instrument business. I guess, as you just think about sort of whether we had any pull forwards or just how is the sort of seasonality of the business is shifting over time, I guess two years in a row, we've had this kind of strong Q4, weak Q1 dynamic. It's happened before in the past for Waters. But, I guess, how much of that is sort of in your control and how much is out of your control? How much \u2013 when you saw the numbers, as you looked at it, did you sort of stare at it and say, wow, this happened to us again, how much can we control. I'm just trying to get a sense of what's in your hands versus what's out of your hands a bit and how this business is kind of performing on at least a sequential basis?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah, thanks. Fair question. And certainly, as you pointed out, we saw a lot of strength across the board in Q4. And, frankly, based on that confidence and an assumption of more stable market conditions heading into the year, we had kind of a normal outlook for the first quarter. And we did see the downtick. As you point out, the seasonality effect in this pattern of a slow start to the quarter, in particular, as it relates to the release of budget by pharma companies and industrial companies is something we've seen. And in the example of last year and even in 2017, we saw strength at the end of the year.","And so, at this point, as we look out over the course of the year, we certainly expect that the budget release cycle will lighten up and we'll get the benefit of expected planned customer spending, particularly in pharmaceuticals and in major industrial customers. ","And, I guess, the other major controllable from our standpoint is just the great progress we're making in product development and the increasing impact we expect from the product launches that we have new in the market and that are coming over the course of the year. On the Waters side, that is headlined by the BioAccord launch which, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, is going well in its early stages from the standpoint of training and demoing and market development. And then, there's a lot more coming on the Waters side, including new entrants in the high-resolution mass spec technology category, more LC technology, and more MS technology as well.","And on the TA side, we're really in a sweet spot relative to the product cycle on thermal. We have more technology coming on rheology and we have a wave of accessorization, which often is a great complement to the core instrument development.","So, I think we feel about as good as we can possibly feel about where we sit in front of the product cycle still. And, certainly, the macro effects of Q1 are disappointing and were unexpected, but they do not diminish in any way our enthusiasm for what's happening on the innovation side here.","Ross Muken","Thanks, Chris. Appreciate the color. ","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good morning. I want to start with a high level, but I think a really important question. For many years, you guys have been running what was the premium growth name in the tools group. Waters consistently delivered above peer group growth. But in the last 18 months, Waters has delivered below peer group growth and management \u2013 your ability to forecast has not been as solid as it was in the previous few years. But what's your diagnosis for this at this point and what's being done to remedy this? Because, yes, it was a disappointing quarter, but beyond that \u2013 this isn't the first quarter where we've been disappointed at the top line over the last 18 months. So, I'm just wondering what you're doing to improve visibility and what your diagnosis is of what's been below peer growth over the last several quarters?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, Doug. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. I think stepping back and looking at the big picture, this is a great franchise. Waters is a very well-established and a very durable business. And really, a lot of the factors we've seen in a couple of individual quarters, of course, including Q1, are very unique to the particular mix of our business. The China business, for example, is 18% of our worldwide revenue. And as you know, the mix within China is uniquely focused on pharma, with an over-index on generic pharma and food. And so, some of the macro effects, given that we're a more specialty oriented company, certainly, have the potential to hit us in a unique way.","Relative to product cycle, I think that's been a big area of focus for me personally. It's really my number one area of focus. And there are some aspects of the portfolio that we weren't where we needed to be. And we've invested a lot and worked hard in product development to shore that up. And as I mentioned in the previous question, we're excited about what's ahead relative to the product cycle.","So, we really feel like, in that way, we control our destiny and there are better things to come as that product cycle matures. And, obviously, we're doing all we can to gain visibility into some of these end market macro factors to improve the forecasting, to make sure that we can see with reasonable certainty what's ahead.","But like I said, Q1 was an outlier for us. It was something that, coming off the end of the year last year, was not something we expected to see. And so, we're just reacting to the changing environment and making sure that we stay very, very focused on delivering on our product pipeline and delivering on our sales execution. And as I sort of alluded to before, yes, Q1 was soft, but it's certainly not deterred that focus or the conviction in the great opportunities that lie ahead for Waters.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thanks for that, Chris. And maybe just more of a near-term timing question, recognizing you've walked through what happened in the quarter a couple of times here, just to go back to the point you made about some of this being a function of delays in the release of capital budgets at biopharma and industrial customers, it doesn't seem like your Q2 guidance treats these delays and the release of capital budgets as a transitory issue where you recover some of that lost Q1 revenue in Q2 just because of timing. Is that right? And if so, why? Essentially, what I'm trying to get at is, if this was a transitory issue, whether or not you've seen a recapture of at least some of that revenue three weeks into the second quarter?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. Certainly, Doug, we don't give updates on a weekly or a monthly basis. But I would just say that the philosophy on the Q2 guide is that we don't expect all the factors that affected us in Q1 to just bring back \u2013 right as we get into April that these budget release cycle dynamics can take time to play out, that the macroenvironment which we're watching closely and studying and learning more about again doesn't just spring back in one quarter. So, I think the Q2 guide really reflects that moderated outlook that we've made for the rest of the year. And, obviously, it's our job to do the very best to deliver the most we can within that.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. All right. Thanks again.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Next question is from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. I want to start with capital deployment and maybe following up on Doug's question earlier about some of the volatility you've seen. As you talked about, you repurchased 3.2 million shares during the quarter. Can you just talk to the thought process here given the underlying volatility, maybe the lack of visibility, why is this the right time to be buying back stock, why not wait till business stabilizes a bit? ","And then, can you also talk to the degree \u2013 with the tempered outlook, if you're considering any cost actions?","Sherry Buck","Hi. I'll start off on this question. As far as our capital deployment, maybe just to put some context around it, it's really going back to our strategy around our capital structure after tax reform where we had access to all of our global cash. And so, from a capital structure standpoint, we are working towards 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio. And during the first quarter, we deployed about $750 million and our guide for Q2 is about $600 million.","And as we look at this, we look at our capital deployment opportunities in three buckets \u2013investing in the business and our balance sheet management and then return to shareholders. And we have the capacity and flexibility to return capital to shareholders, while still investing in our business at the appropriate levels and for other opportunities that may come along. So, despite the weaker Q1, we are committed to continuing on our capital allocation path.","But I think the other question you had, Tycho, was around our operating expenses. I think as you look at Waters, we have been very disciplined historically around managing our expenses. But, again, this is a point in the quarter and we will still continue to invest in R&D and other critical areas of growth for us and balance our different capital allocation levers. But during the quarter, we were also maintaining costs and will continue to do that as we manage through the year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then, one for Chris. You touched on a number of the pharma components. I'm just curious if you can disaggregate how much of the softness was the China generic impact versus kind of the global pharma budget release dynamic. And to be clear, can you just clarify what your expectations are for pharma for the remainder of the year? Do you expect them to get back to kind of low-single digit or mid-single digit growth?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. I think our confidence in the pharma business for the year is still positive and we expect to work our way back into what might be more traditionally normal type growth rates over the course of the year. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the biopharma business was strong in the quarter and that continued the pattern that we've been seeing. We've been executing well in biopharma and we continue to benefit from all the innovation in that space. And, obviously, we've made incremental investments in that space ourselves. The hit in the quarter on pharma was really around the small molecule business. Generics is an important part of that. We're a leader in LC-based testing for QA\/QC. As you know, the vast majority of our pharma revenue is oriented to late-stage development in QA\/QC. And so, when a sector like generic gets hit, we tend to feel the effects. As I mentioned, China is a slightly bigger mix of generic in its pharma business than our global average. And so, we saw particular effect there.","The thing that we realize in this business is that small molecule business, particularly generics business, that's where market share is the stickiest and it's where also we have sort of a good read on the ongoing activity in that installed base based on our chemistry business, which remains solid.","So, I think we have confidence that capital purchasing will come back over time over the course of the year, both within China as well as within other parts of the business. Our top pharma accounts in Western Europe and in the US were soft in the first quarter based on the kind of budget release cycle, but that's something that traditionally does come back over the course of the year.","So, we feel generally that the pharma trends outside of those specific situations are intact. And so, we're just staying very, very focused on taking advantage of those growth opportunities here over the course of the year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","Next question is from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Derik De Bruin","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. It's Mike Ryskin on for Derik. I want to follow-up on something that was brought up earlier regarding the volatility in the quarter. Just given some of the optimism and the tone in your analyst day in late February, it seems like there were a few surprises across the business. Is there anything that's changed in the underlying fundamentals of any of these markets where there is reduced visibility now versus prior levels? And then, I've got a follow-up.","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Just in terms of the volatility in the quarter and the Investor Day comment you made, our focus at the investor day was certainly on the bigger picture and the overall strategy of the company, particularly the innovation story and the strength of our management team and really that \u2013 we were clear at the meeting that those were the issues we were focusing on. And, certainly, as you know, our quarters tend to be back weighted. We generate approximately half of our sales in the last month of the quarter. And so, certainly, March was unexpectedly soft and some of the volatility we saw related to some of the macro and budget release factors was particularly pronounced in the month of March. And so, when we look at the overall pattern of the quarter and some of those factors, we really don't think there are fundamental underlying changes in the attractiveness of the market segments we participate in or in the strength of our franchise and we're just trying to stay very, very steady and focused to understand these unique factors to manage through them and to continue to keep our focus on our strong conviction of the growth that's ahead of us in these areas.","Derik De Bruin","Appreciate that. Thanks. That was going to be one of my follow-ups over the pacing and the progression through the quarter. One last quick one was, any change in sort of your expectations for contributions from new products over the course of the year. typically, you'd think you'd want to launch into strong or at least improving end markets. And given some of the choppiness you called out in the macro and in China, does that change your outlook at all?","Christopher O'Connell","I think the contribution for new products is definitely a hallmark of 2019. And, certainly, as we've thought about this from the very beginning, it has always been something we saw developing over the course of the year, strengthening in the back half of the year, reflecting that technology that's already in the market. New technology like BioAccord is is more of a market development game and takes time, especially with a big ticket purchase that needs to be worked through budgets.","But also, we have incremental technology coming in in the second and third quarters that will also help create that effect. And so, I think our new product contribution story is still very much the way we thought it would look as we came into the year and something that gets greater and greater traction through the year and then into the future.","Derik De Bruin","All right. Thanks, Chris.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good morning. Chris or Sherry, I want to come back to the 2Q guide, if we can, and it'd be great if you can just elaborate on whether or not you expect Europe and China specifically to return to growth in the second quarter, especially given this is kind of the third quarter in a row now, I think, where Europe has been down. And it would also be great if you can help us with kind of what you're expecting out of Europe for the full year?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. I'll just make a quick comment and then let Sherry add to it. I think we've taken a more cautious guide outlook for sure. But with that, we do expect modest improvements in both those markets. We think Europe and China remain structurally strong; and notwithstanding some the macro headwinds, are focused on some of that underlying activity. Certainly, not forecasting it to be where we thought it would be coming into the year, but we are expecting stepping back towards growth over the course of the year. So, Sherry, I don't know if you want to say more about the guide.","Sherry Buck","Yeah. I think you covered as far as those geographies, Chris.","Christopher O'Connell","Great.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. And then, maybe for Sherry, how much of the guidance reset in terms of the organic growth for the year was TA versus Waters, specifically? And then, could you speak to exactly how orders trended in the first quarter? I know you kind of spoke qualitatively to the demo and quote activity, but would be curious if the book to bill was north of 1 actually in the first quarter?","Sherry Buck","Yeah. So, as far as our full-year guide, as we looked at the factors that impacted us in Q1 and our results, the lowering of our guide was mainly due to our overall lower volume and lower expected revenue, as well as our miss in Q1. Probably won't get as specific as breaking it down between Waters and TA. We've really looked at it kind of as our whole portfolio as we put the guidance together. ","Do you want to comment on the orders, Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. I would just \u2013 we don't want to get into too much detail on the order book versus sales, but would comment that we did carry some incremental backlog into the second quarter.","Brandon Couillard","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next question is from Daniel Brennan from UBS. Your line is now open.","Daniel Brennan","Great, thank you. Chris, first question. I wanted to go back to China. Could just elaborate on the 4+7 policy, maybe its impact on your business and how long you think this change in how China is operating will persist?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. Just a little bit more on the 4+7. This is something that we, in the market, became more aware of later in the year. It was really kind of an October, November, December kind of awareness of this particular pilot program for more centralized bulk purchasing of generic medicines within four major cities and seven other provincial type cities.","As I sort of alluded to earlier in the call, this particular initiative did not affect our sales in 2018. We saw very typical year-end type purchasing that reflected more of a status quo type situation. Certainly, as we got in the quarter, it became more clear that even though the underlying utilization of the installed base was there, as I spoke of earlier, we had strong chemistry sales in China in the quarter that capital purchasing was being put on hold, much like many of the capital investments that the companies affected by this particular initiative were experiencing. So, I think we don't have perfect visibility into how quickly we can recoup some of that capital investment. And that's why we've moderated our guidance for the quarter and for the year.","As I've alluded to earlier, we have a really strong market position and a really strong team in China that's consistently delivered in a variety of operating environments. And so, while we have lowered our expectations, we do expect some modest improvements over the course of the year.","Daniel Brennan","Great. And then, maybe kind of more of a big picture question. I know your weaker trends in biopharma comparing against stronger results in some of your peers. Obviously, you have a different mix of business. But can you just speak to the strategy, part of your five-point strategy being like a leader in your strategically focused, but narrower markets. Is that opening up Waters to any share loss towards larger players that could use maybe their breadth to bundle and kind of how you think about that in terms of your strategy towards investment and cap deployment? Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. In terms of the question of focus versus breadth, I think we have a high level of conviction in our focused, specialty-oriented strategy. And we don't really see any evidence that we have difficulty competing based on a more limited product line. We think that Waters is better served with a focus on depth of application expertise in more narrowly focused areas within biopharma and small molecule pharmaceuticals, as we talked in depth at the Investor Day. We've made significant investments in the biopharm side of the business over time and we've actually gained share steadily over the last 10 or 15 years, and I'd reference you to those charts that we presented at our Investor Day.","Of course, on the small molecule side, which is the one that experienced the volatility in the quarter, because, certainly, on the large molecule side, we had another strong quarter, on the small molecule side, we think that those factors are little more specific in nature related to the macro factors that we outlined. And looking at our market share data, particularly in LC, we see a very strong and stable and sticky market share position. And I think as everyone knows, certainly, one quarter, that type of situation doesn't move around a lot.","So, we're confident that the effect we saw on the small mol business in particular in Q1 are really related to these market factors. And we're just very, very focused on continuing to invest in our technology position and our application science to be the very best company in the specialty manner that we set out to be.","Daniel Brennan","Great, thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Next question is from Sung Ji Nam from BTIG. Your line is now open.","Sung Ji Nam","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-part question on your Waters instruments. So, for BioAccord, you talked about strong early market development activity. Would you be able to speak kind of where you're seeing that? Is that global or is that in a certain geographic region?","And then, secondly, would you be able to break out kind of what your outlook is for Waters instrument growth this year and how much of that is contingent on new product sales or the new product cycle versus the existing portfolio benefiting from improving end market outlook? Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Thanks, Sung Ji. Yeah. So, the BioAccord launch has been really exciting. We officially launched the product at the well-characterized biopharmaceutical conference. And really, a lot of the early activity we saw was in some of the developed markets, US and Western Europe, in particular. But one of the things that happened more mid-quarter was we had a significant launch in China. And literally hundreds of customers attend a really robust and kind of high-energy launch event that led to a variety of customer relationship developments and getting people into demo type situations.","I use the word market development because this is really a new category for regulated laboratories for high-resolution mass spectrometry in a compliant package to really lead us into method process development and, ultimately, QA\/QC for large molecules in the MAM space. And that's, obviously, kind of a new direction for the market.","We continue to do all the right things to develop that market. We, obviously, have taken orders and shipped some units, although we never really expected to do all that much of that in the earlier part of the year. And so, I'm really looking at metrics around MQLs or marketing qualified leads as well as that demoing activity.","Another key aspect of our launch readiness is to forward place the BioAccord system in our own demonstration labs at an accelerated pace compared to what we've done historically with other systems. And that's been really effective because it's brought many more customers into the demo phase which can ultimately accelerate quoting and ordering.","And so, it's all systems go. And we continue to press on that opportunity. And by the way, we've always thought, along with the launch, it creates an opportunity for our sales folks to have a broader conversation about Waters and the collateral positive impacts of having new technology and how that affects the rest of our product line. Interestingly enough, it's had a positive effect on our overall high-resolution mass spectrometry portfolio.","So, anyway, that's just one platform and, certainly, there are others coming. And as you allude to, something that will have a positive effect on our instrument performance over the course of the year are those new product launches. So, I don't want to get into too many specifics around the exact dollar amount or percentage increment that we expect from new products over the course the year, but we do expect that contribution to strengthen over the course of 2019.","Sung Ji Nam","Great, thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good morning. Two questions for you. First, Chris, you've talked quite a bit about end markets and geographies. I was wondering if you could \u2013 if you had any thoughts as it relates to share and if you've seen any impact on your share in addition to impact from the markets? Do you think you're gaining or potentially losing any more share than maybe you have been over the last several quarters?","And then, just following up on some other questions, can you explain to me again what gets better in the second quarter versus the first quarter? Obviously, you're going against a little bit more difficult comps in 2Q, but it sounds like the pressures in China and in Europe are expected to largely continue. So, I'm trying to still figure out what exactly gets you to the 2% to 4% organic growth versus the flat here in the first quarter? Thank you so much.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, Steve. Thanks. From the standpoint of market share on the first part of your question, as I've sort of alluded to before, when you break it down into the various technology categories where we have good market share data, we feel that our market share and our core LC business, our core TA businesses is very solid and certainly all the data coming out of the 2018 market calculations reinforce that and backed up as well by import data in countries that capture that kind of information.","We've acknowledged here for some time, we've had some pressure on the mass spec side of the business which is why we've invested in differential strategies because we do believe in the growth and the potential of the mass spec product line and are excited about what's in our portfolio.","So, really, from a market share standpoint, I don't have any new information from the quarter other than what the data said at the end of last year and the overall confidence in the durability of our market share franchise and in those categories. ","In terms of what gets better in Q2, some of the factors that I alluded to, we do expect a softening up some of the restrictive factors on budget release, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector, to take place over the course of the year and have some impact in Q2. We certainly expect to increase the impact of some of the new product launches that we have in Q2 versus Q1. And, certainly, there are \u2013 while we don't expect something \u2013 a country like China to completely bounce back in one quarter, we are looking to improve upon our performance in China and there are some small incremental positives such as the lowering of the VAT tax that's happening this month in China, which ought to create some additional incentives for capital purchases among key customers.","So, really, it's a composition of a number of those factors. And we're looking to improve upon every one of the factors that affected us in Q1 and continue to improve over the course of the year.","Steve Willoughby","Chris, can I sneak one more question in there? I appreciate that answer. You commented you don't want to get into the impact this year from new products, but maybe you can just give us some context since the BioAccord is now out there. You alluded to a number of other new products coming this year. While I'm sure you don't want to launch those new products on today's conference call, can you just give us some feel or perspective on the other products you have coming and their potential significance versus the potential significance of the BioAccord, meaning the other products you're going to launch later on this year potentially a bigger deal or a smaller deal relative to the BioAccord?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. A fair question. And I would just say, BioAccord has been the headliner simply because of the timing and also the strategic importance of that platform, and both the market segment it's targeted at as well as the conviction we have in the solution. The other one that we haven't specifically mentioned, but you are well aware of, Steve, is the cyclic high mobility, high-resolution mass spectrometer that we continue to expect to launch at the ASMS meeting coming up here shortly. So, we're really excited about that. And, obviously, we're going to get a benefit of that in the second half of the year.","And what I'll just say on the other product launches that we'll provide details on as we move along is that there are a number of what I might call more iterative technologies. If BioAccord and cyclic IMS are new platform technologies, we have a variety of other iterative technologies in both our LC and our mass spec portfolio which will benefit us in particular because those technology categories and product families are well accepted platforms in the market. They can benefit from the refresh as we have them.","So, I'd rather stop there from the standpoint of describing the new product introductions. But everything we said at Investor Day relative to the number of launches and the excitement we have around the launches is very much in front of us here.","Steve Willoughby","Thanks very much.","Christopher O'Connell","We're at the hour, but we'll take one more final question and then wrap it up?","Operator","Okay. The final question for today is from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan","Yeah. Thank you. Chris, I just want to go back to Europe. I appreciate, with Brexit, maybe there was slower purchasing. But, logically, what was the feedback you were hearing from customers related to that? The reason I ask is it's not something that we've heard from a couple of your peers. And I think the prevailing logic was there might be actually some stocking related to Brexit. So, again, the feedback that you're hearing from customers would be helpful.","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. Related to Brexit, we certainly didn't see any unusual stocking activity, whether it was over the course of last year or early this year. And, obviously, the Brexit stalemate has been kicked down the road to the October timeframe. And we continue to develop our contingency plans for the eventuality \u2013 the potential eventuality of a hard Brexit.","I think what we saw in our business was softer demand, particularly in Northern Europe, in and around the UK and countries that are the most active trading partners with the UK. And a lot of that really related to just the general caution of budgets in a new year where some of the macro clouds continue to hang. ","We, obviously, see different dynamics in different parts of Europe and actually saw better performance in Southern Europe and some other parts that were maybe a little bit away from the Northern European areas. ","So, Europe has been a very strong market for us historically. It's gone through some bumps here in the last quarter, in the last year, but we have a lot of confidence that the customers in those areas will be there for the long-term. And we're just trying to stay very focused on the underlying activity, which, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is actually positive relative to demoing and quoting type of activities, particularly in pharma.","So, anyway, we're just going to stay very focused on trying to get that business back and return Europe to a growth profile over the course of the year.","Jack Meehan","Okay. And then, just as a final \u2013 what was growth in India in the quarter and can you talk about the economic activity that you're seeing there?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Yeah. For a final comment, that's a good place to end because India was obviously a very dynamic situation over the last year. But, India, we're seeing all the signs that we hoped and expected to see coming into the year of stabilizing business. As I alluded to in my comments, India grew solidly in the mid-single digits and had even better performance in LC and in pharma. So, we actually saw strength in pharma and strength in LC in India, and that is on the heels of what was actually a pretty good fourth quarter as well. The fourth quarter of 2018 was our second-highest quarter ever in India and had a tough comp, but we rolled into this year with continuing steady demand returning on the instrument side to complement the business on the chemistry and service side.","Obviously, India is not out of the woods yet as it relates to political questions. As you know, the election cycle is underway. And while most people expect the stability of a Modi government, and that's certainly our hope as well, we're just being appropriately cautious as we kind of work through that. But the fundamental underlying health of the pharma sector and of our business appears to be on the rebound there in India and we're gratified by that.","Christopher O'Connell","So, thank you very much for that question. And thanks for all of your questions today.","In conclusion, we are focused on delivering improved growth over the course of 2019, headlined by improving instrument purchasing dynamics, continued growth in our recurring revenue and the growing contribution from new products.","As always, we are committed to delivering reliable earnings performance based on our organic growth and supported by our enhanced capital deployment program.","On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our second quarter 2019 call, which we currently anticipate holding on July 30, 2019. ","Thank you. And have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference call begins. This conference call is being recorded. If anyone have objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Bryan Brokmeier, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bryan Brokmeier","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the Company for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.","In Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K. We further caution you that the Company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 23, 2019.","During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the mostly directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to the earnings press release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter and fiscal year 2017. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Waters' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, I will provide an overview of our third quarter operating results, as well as some broader commentary on our business. Sherry will then review our financial results in details and provide comments on our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.","Briefly reviewing our financial highlights, our revenues grew 3% for both third quarter and year-to-date and adjusted earnings per share grew 8% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. While we continue to make significant progress on our key strategic initiatives, our third quarter sales growth came in below our expectations that we shared with you during the July call.","While we continue to see strength in China and had a nice improvement in U.S Pharma, we saw weaker than expected performance in two key areas: our TA Instruments product line and the European Pharma market. Furthermore, the recovery of normalized growth in India is progressing slowly.","To give you a bit more color on Q3 soft spots, I will start with TA Instruments. While growth in this product line was 6% year-to-date, TA had a soft sales quarter due to the timing of certain shipments to U.S., European, and Chinese customers. That said, underlying TA order growth in Q3 was encouraging and was in line with the year-to-date order trends despite the slower than expected sales in the quarter.","We continue to be excited about the near and long-term prospects of the TA product line, which is in the early innings of a major new product cycle and thermal analysis and is supported by solid economic backdrop.","Our European growth was challenged in the quarter by pressure within our pharmaceutical end market. Though we saw an improvement in big Pharma in the U.S during the quarter, spending among top pharma customers in Europe remains tempered with uncertain dynamics heading into the end of 2018.","On the positive side, sales to our pharmaceutical customers in the U.S picked up meaningfully during the quarter. We are encouraged with the improved spending that we are seeing by our largest pharma customers in the U.S and our Q4 expectations assume a continuation of that trend. Outside of the U.S., we continue to excel in China with strong mid teens growth. Furthermore, worldwide LC Instrument demand remain stable.","Looking briefly at the P&L, we are pleased with the solid earnings results despite the slower than expected top line growth. While investing in future growth through organic innovation, we demonstrated disciplined operating expense management that drove modest margin expansion enabling us to exceed our earnings-per-share target.","Taking a closer look at the business now, starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, third quarter sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category increased 2% year-over-year driven by double-digit growth in China and the aforementioned pickup in the U.S., partially offset by a modest decline in European Pharma markets and the decline in sales into clinical applications.","Importantly, our LC product line remain solid outside of market related pockets of weakness in India and Europe. Year-to-date, overall sales to our pharmaceutical markets are up 3% against a solid prior year performance. We feel good about our pharma market position, and in particular our ability to meet the needs of customers in bio molecule applications.","The investment environment remains positive and we see long-term growth opportunities based on the global pipeline of new drug development. Sales to these customers continue to perform well and we're confident in our positioning in large molecule applications, which account for approximately one-third of our pharma business.","Third quarter sales to our worldwide industrial category, which includes the materials characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets grew 2% year-over-year, led by strength in the chemical analysis and food markets. Despite softer than expected growth in the quarter, we remain confident in our product positions and pipeline as well as the breadth of opportunities across material characterization, food, safety and environmental applications. Year-to-date, our worldwide industrial category sales were up 1%.","Sales from our governmental and academic category increased by 8% in the third quarter with strong growth in Asia and the Americas, partially offset by softer demand in Europe. Weakness in biomedical research applications was more than offset by strength in both environmental research and pharmaceutical discovery among these customers. Year-to-date, our governmental and academic category was up 9%.","Next I will review our sales performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest region in terms of revenue was up 7% in the quarter and double-digit growth in China and modest growth in India. Demand in China remains robust with strong growth in pharma, food, and fine chemical markets, partially offset by softness within our TA Instruments product line.","Turning to the Americas, overall sales grew 2% in the quarter, while sales within the U.S were flat. Although Canada and Latin America were strong, growth in these regions was offset by softness in the U.S. Increasing strength in our U.S Pharma customer base that we mentioned before, was offset by softness in clinical applications in our TA Instruments product line.","In Europe, sales were down 2% during the quarter as solid industrial sales in the region were offset by lower-than-expected pharmaceutical growth, driven by unexpected weakness from large pharma, clinical applications and biomedical research.","Finally, I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instrument sales were flat in the third quarter with strength in standalone chromatography instruments. Within LC, momentum continues to build for the Acuity Arc Bio and the Acuity Plus, which we launched earlier in the year.","Meanwhile, our overall LC Instrument sales growth was largely driven by the Alliance system, with strong growth across all geographies, further reinforcing the underlying strength of our HPLC position in regulated markets. Our mass spec product line improved modestly compared to the first half of the year and encouragingly we saw stabilization in our high resolution mass spec portfolio. Our core tandem quad mass spec portfolio has sold well over the last year, highlighted by the Xevo TQ-XS.","During the quarter, we began shipping the Xevo TQ-GC system and DART QDa with LiveID, both of which will initially target the food safety testing market. There is significant opportunity in Asia, and particularly in China where food safety testing is just beginning to shift from legacy government labs to newly established independent labs.","We are also excited about the newly announced launch of the RenataDX our next generation screening system for high throughput general use clinical diagnostics. This fully integrated bench-top system is an open platform with proven reliable and robust performance and it builds on Waters' 20 years of experience serving the needs of newborn screening and general clinical diagnostic laboratories.","Waters branded recurring revenues, which reflect the combination of service and precision chemistries and represent approximately 50% of the businesses total sales, grew 5% in the quarter. We saw strong growth of recurring revenues in Pharma, driven by global strength in our service application kits UPLC Columns and Bioseparation columns. In particular, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our recently launched BioResolve reversed-phase monoclonal antibody columns.","Turning to our TA product line, sales increased 1% in the third quarter. Instrument systems sales for TA increased by 1 -- decreased by 1%, excuse me, and service sales increased 8%. Softer sales in our thermal analyzers offset strength in our rheology, microcalorimetry and ElectroForce product lines. As we highlighted earlier, our consistent order growth, strong product portfolio and leading market position give us confidence in the continuing strength of our TA products.","In summary, our year-to-date growth has been uneven due to some unexpected dynamics in a few key geographies and product categories. That said, we\u2019ve maintained strong operational discipline and exceeded our earnings expectations. We are making significant progress against our growth initiatives, headlined by our efforts over the past several years to transform our innovation process that is beginning to deliver a series of next generation products to market.","Before some additional comments on innovation and capital deployment, I would like to reiterate that we remain steadfastly focused on executing on our five point value creation model. As we have previously communicated, we aim to create shareholder value by one, holding a focused and highly differentiated position in structurally attractive markets. Two, executing a clear growth strategy driven by organic innovation. Three, seeking opportunity for continuous operational improvement. Four, being a disciplined capital allocator, and five, operating with performance oriented culture and management team.","We continue to prioritize and invest proactively in organic innovation with year-to-date R&D investments growing 7%. To augment these internal innovations, we are increasingly evaluating select external technologies to strengthen our overall product portfolio and enhance our organically developed products. There is a lot of excitement throughout Waters about our innovation transformation and the resulting enhancements in our new product pipeline.","Our management team has stepped up the pace and focus of new product development over the past several years and we are now beginning to see the benefits of these efforts. In 2018, we have launched the Acuity Arc Bio System, the Acuity UPLC Plus Series, the Xevo TQGC, the Dart QDa with LiveID, the RenataDX screening system and numerous chemistry products as well as additions to our TA product line such as the DMA 850. While these new products have seen successful launches, we expect to realize a greater revenue contribution from them in 2018 and beyond.","Looking ahead to 2019, we are excited about a number of additional launches that will begin a major new product cycle, highlighted by the first steps of our BioTOF program. This biopharmaceutical LCMS system is the industry's first integrated bench-top mass spectrometry-based platform for routine monitoring and release testing.","Our biopharmaceutical customers employ a diverse range of users who need to make analytical decisions more efficiently. This system delivers a sample to result, streamline workflow process that will enable routine operators to acquire reproducible decision supporting data that is more of a challenge to obtain using existing research grade mass spec systems. This new system is compact enough to sit on a bench, but powerful enough to deliver the high-end performance needed to monitor and quantify multiple product and\/or process attributes within a single analysis.","Shifting to capital deployment, we have concluded an extensive review of our capital deployment strategy following U.S tax reform. This seminal event has provided Waters with more tax efficient access to our global cash, and as a result we intend to put our balance sheet to work in 2019. We will further accelerate our recently enhanced share buyback program and target a near-term capital structure featuring a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.5x. Sherry will provide further details on capital deployment in her comments.","To go further on these critical topics and provide investors with deeper insights into Waters and our key growth initiatives, I'm pleased to announce that we plan to host an Investor Day on the morning of February 28, 2019 in New York City. I look for -- I look forward to engaging with you in that forum, which will include in-depth management presentations, an opportunity for Q&A, and informal interaction with the management team. More details about the event will be forthcoming, but please save the date on your calendars.","With that, I would like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of third quarter financials. Sherry?","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we recorded net sales of $578 million, an increase of approximately 3% in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 1%, resulting in 2% sales growth as reported. In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical and industrial markets both grew 2% and sales into our governmental and academic markets grew 8%.","Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue which represents a combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue grew 6% in the quarter, while instrument sales were flat. As we noted last quarter, there was no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the third quarter, but there is one additional calendar day in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2017.","Breaking product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services grew 3%, while sales of TA branded products grew 1%, combined LC and LCMS instrument platform sales were flat and TA's instrumentation system sales decreased by 1%. Our total recurring revenues, which includes both Waters and TA products grew by 6%.","Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter geographically and on a constant currency basis, sales in the Americas were up 2% with flat sales in the U.S. European sales were down 2% and sales in Asia were up 7%, led by 13% growth in China.","Now I would like to comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin was 58.3% for both the third quarters of 2018 and 2017. Moving down, the third quarter P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 1% on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation decreased operating expense growth by approximately 2% on a reported basis.","In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 15.1%, up 290 basis points year-over-year, which was in line with our expectation and reflects the net impact of U.S tax reform that we discussed in our Q4 2017 earnings call.","Net interest expense was $2 million, down $3 million from the prior year benefiting from reduced debt levels as part of our capital deployment framework as well as higher rates of return on investments versus the prior year. Our average share count came in at 77.1 million shares, approximately 3.4 million shares lower than in the third quarter of last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter were up 8% to a $1.92 in comparison to earnings of a $1.77 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $1.83 versus a $1.69 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings can be found in the press release that we issued this morning.","Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our third quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the third quarter of 2018, free cash flow came in at a $136 million after funding $27 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow were $8 million for U.S tax reform related payments, $5 million related to the funding of certain international pension plan, and $4 million related to the investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry Operation.","In the third quarter, this results in $0.24 of each dollar sales converted into free cash flow and $0.26 year-to-date. In terms of returning capital to shareholders during the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $264 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased 4.1 million shares for $808 million. These capital allocation activities along with our free cash flow resulted in cash and short-term investments of $2.1 billion and debt of $1.2 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $900 million.","I would like to provide some additional comments related to capital deployment and our near-term capital structure. Consistent with prior communications, we prioritized capital deployment in three markets. Number one, invest in the business; second, maintain our balance sheet strength and flexibility; and third, return capital to shareholders. We continue to be committed to returning cash to shareholders.","In April 2018, we announced a new share repurchase program of $3.5 billion, which was the first step from our comprehensive review of capital deployment following U.S tax reform that provided us with more tax efficient access to our global cash.","Following up on Chris's earlier comments, we\u2019ve continued to review our capital structure and have concluded with our Board of Directors that we\u2019ve the ability to accelerate the pace of our share repurchase program, but also maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in the business through both organic and inorganic opportunities.","Towards that end, we plan to continue the acceleration of share repurchases during the fourth quarter and anticipate buying back approximately $500 million of our common stock. This would bring our full-year 2018 share repurchases to about $1.3 billion. As we look forward to 2019, we plan to utilize our balance sheet to support a near-term capital structure of approximately 2.5x net debt to EBITDA ratio with a robust share repurchase program for 2019.","We will provide more details of our 2019 plans during our Q4 earnings call and at our Investor Day in February 2019.","Accounts receivable, days sales outstanding increased to 77 days this quarter, up from 73 days in the third quarter of last year. In the quarter, inventories increased by approximately $16 million in comparison to the prior year quarter, which was in line with typical seasonal patterns.","As we look forward to the balance of the year, I would like to comment on our full-year 2018 guidance. Our outlook assumes continued global growth and demand from our end markets and continued growth in our recurring revenue. These dynamics support full-year 2018 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 3% to 4%, from our prior guidance range of 4% to 6%.","At current rates, currency translation is assumed to increase 2018 sales growth by about one percentage point. Gross margin guidance for the year is unchanged at 58.5% to 59%. Our plan for the full-year is to continue managing operating expense growth at a rate that is below our sales growth rate.","Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $11 million from our prior guidance of $14 million. This assumes that the debt repaid in the first three quarters of 2018 is not reborrowed during the course of the year.","Our full-year effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 13% to 15%. Our guidance assumes continued acceleration of share repurchases in the fourth quarter as mentioned in my earlier remarks and will result in an average diluted share count of approximately 78 million shares outstanding.","Rolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2018 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be in the range of $8 to $8.10 from our prior guidance range of $8.05 to $8.20. At current rates, the foreign currency impact on full-year earnings per share growth is expected to be neutral, which is consistent with our prior guidance.","Looking at the fourth quarter of 2018, our guidance assumes a continuation of our year-to-date performance trends. Therefore, we expect 3% to 4% constant currency sales growth in the fourth quarter. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to decrease fourth quarter sales growth by 1 to 2 percentage points. Combining these top line factors with a moderate increase in expenses, we estimate fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.55 to $2.65, which assumes an approximate 4% negative impact from currency translation at current rates.","Chris will now make a few summary comments. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Great. Thank you, Sherry. To recap, during Q3 and through the first three quarters of 2018, we\u2019ve seen some unexpected bumps in a few key geographies and product categories. That said, we\u2019ve maintained strong operational discipline and exceeded our earnings expectations, while remaining steadfastly focused on delivering our significant new technology pipeline through our enhanced innovation program. Furthermore, we remain confident in the health of our end markets and our strong competitive position in our priority categories. I look forward to updating you further in early 2019.","With that, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not always able to get to everyone's questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Waters investor relations team after the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first response from Steve Beuchaw, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good morning and thanks for the time here. I think, Chris, it would help if you just try to think about 2018 in totality and compare that to the sort of historical norm of mid single-digit plus, Pharma growth which we think of generally is the bellwether for Waters. Over the course of this year, you\u2019ve had a couple of, what we know, one-off headwinds. How would you summarize, what this year is a one-off headwind? And what can you tell us about how big you think new products are as drivers of acceleration from here?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the question. And I think you characterized it well, the pattern we\u2019ve seen throughout the year has shown some bumps in the road that we're not fully expected as we headed into the year and in a couple of key geographies and product lines. Obviously, the most consistent headwind we've seen over the course of the year has been in India, which has knocked down our growth by a 1% or point or more and we can go deeper on India with what a year-ago was a customer base working through the GST tax implementation issues has evolved a little bit to some broader economic concerns, obviously the rupee is way down on a year-over-year basis. And so, a variety of factors including some political uncertainty in India have really contributed to that being consistent headwind. And outside of that, we\u2019ve had some pockets of market related issues in Europe that we saw in the quarter. That said, we\u2019ve some real positives that we\u2019ve seen over the course of the year as well. China's been very consistent as a tailwind and the U.S which started out quite slow has been improving particularly in Pharma, which is probably the thing that we watch most closely. And so -- as I look at the year in totality and on your point of innovation, we\u2019ve just tried to remain steadfastly focused on the execution of what is a really exciting multiyear innovation cycle. This year, in 2018, particularly in the back half of the year, we've seen more incremental product launches than the prior two years combined and those really should start showing their promise and of course as we look ahead to 2019, we have -- what I consider non-incremental type of product launches coming with the BioTOF program, some new entrants in high resolution mass spec and in some other areas. So, that's really our core strategy. We\u2019ve not wavered from that. And as we\u2019ve worked through some of the geography and product line bumps in '18, I think we're -- we remain very confident in the outlook for the business long-term.","Steve Beuchaw","And just to quickly follow-up on a couple of points you made. Can you give us a sense for whether you\u2019re embedding, any assumption for improved trends in India in 4Q? And can you give us any more color on what was behind the slowness that you called out in Pharma in Europe there? And then I will get back in queue. Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. In terms of India, we have moderated our outlook for India. India has been a great market for a long time as you know and what we've observed over the years is that Indian customers tend to be pretty patient buyers. We do see pent-up demand building. But like I said, it's become more clear over the course of the year that the environment in India is reflecting some political uncertainty with the next round of elections coming up next year, and in some degree of economic moderation in part impacted by the rupee devaluation. And so we just remain very focused. We believe India will come back -- it's come back more slowly than we expected. And so we're not assuming a huge bounce in Q4 in terms of our guidance. We are assuming more of a continuation of the trend that we\u2019ve seen throughout the year and that's consistent with Sherry's overall comments on our Q4 outlook reflecting the continuation of what we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. And what was the last part of the question?","Steve Beuchaw","Just looking for clarity on what you believe is the catalyst for the change to trend in Europe? I mean the growth actually considering the comp wasn't particularly different relative to trend, but curios why it was that you called that out?","Christopher O'Connell","Well, we did have a strong double-digit trend in Europe overall with growth in third quarter of prior year. And, I guess, if we look at Western Europe, we did have a significant 2017. 2018 has been a bit softer, we certainly believe our performance reflects more market related factors and we are obviously watching that closely. The tough comp was particularly with strong double-digit Pharma comps, but we probably have seen some incremental effects of some country specific dynamics, certainly, the Brexit situation as it rolls closer to hopefully some sort of a positive resolution has probably put a bit of a chill on sentiment. And certainly, there are some other specific countries like Turkey with some near-term uncertainty. But our franchise in Europe is very strong and we\u2019ve got a customer base there that we expect to persevere. And like I said on my prepared comments, we don't necessarily anticipate a big bounce in Europe in the immediate term, but certainly as we look ahead to next year we expect to see normalization.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks much, Chris.","Christopher O'Connell","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Chris, I want to hone in on a few of the other soft spot you called out, so is industrial. You talked about the timing of shipments there and I think you said the order book was a little bit better. Obviously, the data point from the industrial side have not been very encouraging including a few more headlines today. So I guess what gives you confidence that this really is a timing issue coming out of the quarter?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. Thanks, Tycho. The comments that you referred to I made specifically around the TA Instrument product line. And really what happened in TA is we got to the very end of the quarter, there was a kind of a mix in timing of certain orders that have delayed shipments, including some China shipments that dynamic we saw in a couple different regions, but China, we\u2019ve seen this for a few quarters now just with an elongated process of order to sale. But interestingly enough the order growth which we typically don't provide as much color to, but wanted to in this case, the order growth in TA was encouraging. It was consistent in Q3 with where we see it all year. I think we\u2019ve a lot of confidence in our TA Instruments franchise in terms of the core product position that we have with the new discovery launches we\u2019ve seen and more coming. And certainly from an inventory standpoint, we just had a slightly different mix on hand as we headed towards the quarter in terms of what we saw from an order standpoint, much of that will normalize in Q4. The Chinese situation possibly has some effect linked to the broader trade dynamics in China, but we\u2019ve a robust overall global franchise in TA and expect that to bounce back in Q4.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then similarly, can you comment on the clinical softness, you called that out a few times in your prepared comments as well?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Yes, clinical is actually had a really strong first half, particularly in Europe and its up nicely year-to-date. We just saw a slightly weaker clinical quarter on top of what last year was a pretty big comp and what was a lot of activity in the first half of the year. Some of the comps tend to be lumpy and in certain parts of the clinical business, such as the pain management business where there has been some weakness due to shifts in reimbursement policy in that space, but again stepping back and looking at the bigger picture of clinical, we\u2019ve had a solid year -- year-to-date and we have new product coming into that category, I mentioned in my remarks, the RenataDX, which is a next generation clinical screening system. And we\u2019ve a focused position in clinical diagnostics, particularly in the general use IVD category and we continue to like that business.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just one last one on operational discipline since you highlighted that as well. I\u2019m just curious if you're accelerating any cost actions in this environment or how you\u2019re thinking about OpEx?","Christopher O'Connell","I would say that we continue to monitor our operating expenses very closely. We haven't taken any unusual cost actions. We\u2019ve certainly been more conservative in headcount expansion in some of our operating spending over the course of the year as we saw some of these bumps in the road from a top line standpoint. But as you know Waters has always been a very disciplined operator and will continue to stay focused on those. And like I said in the -- on the remarks, we are pleased to have delivered on the bottom line despite some of the bumps on the top line.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Brennan of UBS. Your line is open.","Daniel Brennan","Hey, Chris. Thank you. So I was hoping to maybe just revisit European biopharma for a moment. Just -- could you just give us little more detail there in terms of actually what did European biopharma grow or extra shrink in the business? And it sounds like it's really related more to the U.K and Turkey is what you called out. So, I guess, I\u2019m just looking for a little bit more color, more broadly across Europe and kind of what you\u2019re seeing with the biopharma customers?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, it's a bit of a mixed bag on biopharma generally, because we did see some weakness in Europe which really related to some of the comps that we had, that were strong there and also some of the general market chill that we've seen in Europe in the past quarter or two. But that was very much offset by strength in biopharma in the U.S. We, as I mentioned before, we saw a really robust quarter in the U.S in biopharma in particular and in Pharma generally. Since our -- since we report by trade class our clinical and biomedical research numbers which were both a bit weak in the quarter, really offset some very encouraging growth in U.S Pharma, and particularly strength in biopharma. So it is a bit of a mixed picture globally, Dan, I would say, and reflects some of the broader themes I mentioned.","Daniel Brennan","And then maybe just one more on India. So India sounds like it grew modestly in the quarter, but obviously your flagging maybe the rupee and some kind of economic uncertainty there. So maybe can you just give us a viewpoint towards your India business and how we should think about the growth rate of that kind of going forward and other? What other signpost we should watch for you do think to see if an Indian recovery is on the horizon for Waters? Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, sure. It's something we are watching carefully. We are trying to be as patient as we can with India because as I mentioned earlier the customers tend to be patient buyers. And if you look over the long history of India, it does go in pretty pronounced cycles. That said, the long-term trend lines are still positive in India and we do believe there is demand building, particularly in the instrument side. We saw -- we\u2019ve seen very steady contribution of our recurring revenues in India, which give us confidence in the underlying demand, in the underlying utilization of the technology. And in terms of the signposts, it's really watching that sort of pent-up customer activity in the underlying volumes they\u2019re producing as measured in what we see in the recurring revenues for some sort of a tipping point. But I think as the ruby -- as the rupee, pardon me, stabilizes and the year-over-year comps there as it relates to our Indian customers become moderated, hopefully that will contribute to the reacceleration of India. But we are just staying very focused there. We really have a lot of confidence in our management team. We\u2019ve confidence in the market and expect that to perk up at some point, hopefully in the not-too-distant future.","Daniel Brennan","Great. Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. There has been a lot of noise around sort of shared dynamics in a couple of your key categories, particularly, in mass spec. I guess, how are you thinking about sort of your competitive performance? And I guess some of this is going to go back to the new product launches, which I guess address some of the markets where you were not maybe competing as aggressively as you would like. But how are you thinking in some of the traditional markets around sort of the shared dynamic and sort of the stability there we're sort of used to seeing?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, sure. Thanks, Ross. Like I mentioned before, if you look to our total first half mass spec product line, we did see some modest improvement in the third quarter and we actually had a reasonably challenging comp year-over-year in mass spec as well. Like I said, we saw a bit of a bounce and some encouraging signs in the high res segment, and as I\u2019ve said many times before, we really do like our core position there, we are a little late in a product cycle on that and looking forward to new products. But I feel like we are moving in the right direction in mass spec. We\u2019ve got a very solid core 10 quad position and as you point out, our near-term product pipeline is robust and we are getting closer to it. For example, on the BioTOF program, we're well into a really exciting phase of customer evaluation and demo of the system, some of which I\u2019ve personally participated in, and we do have a number of near-term new products as well in the high res and broader mass spec category. So like I said, I feel like we are moving in the right direction. It's an important product line for the Company and feel that it's reasonably stable in the near-term and hopefully getting better.","Ross Muken","And I guess on the capital allocation side, as you were sort of debating the merits of sort of more aggressive M&A or other technology purchases, again sort of the share repurchase, it seems like you guys are still remaining fairly biased to repurchase as you take up the leverage. I guess, how are you sort of thinking about that on a returns basis and versus what the business needs to kind of fuel the top line over the next 3, 5 years?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, now that's a terrific question, Ross, and we\u2019ve -- as Sherry pointed out, say, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing the capital allocation, because for us tax reform was a total game changer. We were very locked on our balance sheet beforehand and now we're very unlocked and have a lot of financial flexibility, given the very strong economics of our business and global cash flows. Our priorities for capital allocation are, first, to grow the business and in any scenario, buyback, we are retaining plenty of financial flexibility to invest in the business, headlined by organic innovation capital expense. And as I mentioned, doing more and more to make sure we are close to what's happening outside of our four walls relative to innovation in technology and in considering very purposeful additions. Certainly in a small way you saw that earlier in the year with the Prosolia-DESI IP acquisition. And we will continue to maintain sufficient cash to invest in all of the growth attributes. But with that, certainly we have incremental capacity through our cash on hand, plus borrowing capacity to enhance our buyback program and we feel that now is the right time to put our balance sheet to work and to fully deploy our cash and partially deploy our borrowing capacity to work towards a more optimal capital structure.","Ross Muken","Thanks a lot.","Christopher O'Connell","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be from Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Dan Arias","Hey, good morning. Thanks. Chris, apologies if you mentioned this, but it feels like your 4Q guide doesn\u2019t really assume much in the way of end of the year flush activity from Pharma. Is that fair and is there any insight that you might have into the way that Pharma might spend to finish in 4Q, particularly, if you try to parse out Europe?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. I think that\u2019s a good question on flush and I would say, no, I didn't directly address it. But I would say that our forecast in Q4, as Sherry mentioned, I just reiterate that, we expect a continuation of some of the trends and we are not forecasting a major flush. Certainly, we are looking at that on a geography-by-geography basis. The U.S., as I mentioned earlier, showed a really encouraging uptick in Pharma spending in the third quarter and from where we sit today, we see that as something that ought to continue towards the end of the year. Where on the other hand, we are a little more conservative on our outlook in terms of what happens in Europe relative to year-end type activity. So I think, overall, we\u2019ve a balanced set of assumptions on end of the year purchasing with strength in the U.S. and China and probably more conservative outlook for geographies like Europe and India. So I would characterize it as a bit of a middle of the road assumption.","Dan Arias","Okay. And then maybe just on the BioTOF, it sounds interesting, but the features that you mentioned also sound a lot like some of the ones that you hear when other LCMS players launch products. So without asking you to get too specific, can you just put some color around the differentiation that you expect to have there?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, I will say a little bit more Dan, because we obviously want to give you and the investment community a more complete description at the right time when we get ready for launch. But like I said, from a product development standpoint this has been, in my view, a really successful program where we\u2019ve really hit on all of our key milestones along the way with a system that is very much designed for what the market needs today and in the future. And the reality is the systems in the market that are serving this category today have multi-attribute monitoring and are mostly and including what we're selling into this segment today, really research grade systems that really require expert users have more complex software, can be more variable in terms of reproducibility, require certainly more service from higher skilled engineers and are really more designed for cutting-edge performance as opposed to reproducibility and robustness and regulatory compliance. And so, we are obviously trying to build on the great success we\u2019ve had on the small molecule side with HPLC, plus UV detection and power chromatography data systems to provide a really fit for purpose solution for the accelerating segment of the market in late stage development and ultimately QA\/QC with a very versatile, easy to use, robust time-of-flight type analyzer. So I will kind of leave it at that for now, which is consistent with I think what we've said, but we're also doing the commercialization process quite differently, say in the -- than historically, where we're doing a very robust deep engagement with many key customers to test and trial the system, to get that final piece of feedback and to really demonstrate to our users that this is quite different from what they see on the market today.","Dan Arias","Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","All right. Good morning. Chris, if we look back over the past three years, core growth has gone from, I think it's 6.6% to 5.7% and now to an expected 3% to 4% this year. This is in a period where your peers have been accelerating revenue growth and more recently you\u2019ve missed two of the last three quarters relative to your own core growth targets. I know you are aware of this and I don't mention this to be heavy handed. I mention it because I want to give you another opportunity to address some things that I think will be important for investors as we try to figure out what comes next. So specifically, how confident are you that you have a solid understanding of why Waters has performed the way it has relative to the peer group over the last couple of years? Maybe more importantly, why does it seem like the challenges with visibility that used to be characteristic of Waters the better part of a decade ago, have resurfaced? And most importantly, are you confident based on your diagnosis and your visibility with the business and frankly the efforts that you put in place over the last three years as CEO that Waters can return to historical norms in 2019?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. Hey, Doug, thanks for the question. Appreciate it. And certainly we are not at this point forecasting or giving guidance for 2019, but when we do step back and look at the big picture and look at the natural product cycles that occur in a business like this and really compounded by a lot of Waters specific mix in terms of end markets and geographies and product lines, I think when we step back and look at it, we feel very, very good about the work we are putting in to really build the type of R&D engine that can produce regular consistent cadence of new products that can drive the growth of the business and really a lot. That\u2019s why you see a lot of the commentary that I make and we make coming back to that core innovation story. We certainly believe, we understand the market very, very well. We try to break out various segments to the market, to you and to the investment community in its level of granularity, we think that is wanted. And certainly, if you look at the overall visibility question, when you\u2019re in certain product cycles, you obviously continue to plan for success. You try to fight through various parts of the cycle and obviously, when you get closer to some of the catalysts that you\u2019re looking for to drive the business, then your confidence increases and I think that's sort of where we sit right now. So, yes, I see the same number as you do. And what we are focused on as a management team is just continuing to make the right decisions, the right investments in both the core innovation process and in our ability to deliver that into the marketplace and certainly on a forward looking basis, I feel very confident in what we're doing.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you very much. And Sherry, just a quick one, just to make sure I\u2019m doing the math right. Based on your new guidance of a net debt to EBITDA target of 2.5x, I think that translates into having $4 billion to $4.5 billion of capital to deploy. Am I doing the math right and did you say that you expect this net debt to EBITDA target to be achieved during 2019? Thank you.","Sherry Buck","Yes. Doug, to clarify that our intent is to near-term have a 2.5x net debt to EBITDA and we would plan to achieve that during the course of 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will be from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey thanks. Thanks for taking us. This is Mike on for Derik. I want to follow-up on an earlier question, but just sort of ask it in a fairly bigger picture view. Given some of the issues that we've talked about in 2018, some of the U.S pharma earlier in the year and 2017 as well, and now pharma in Europe and India GST and the political issues there. You've talked through the 4Q expectations pretty thoroughly and how you see those markets in the near-term, but longer term, do you see a return to growth more tied to just broader improvement in those markets and sorting through those issues? Is it tied more to getting over the tough comps over the last couple of years, particularly Europe this quarter, or is it tied to innovation? Is there something in the pipeline, like the BioTOF that\u2019s really needed to get that growth back to that mid single-digit range?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. Mike, thanks for the question. I think it's -- I think our outlook is looking at a bunch of those factors, certainly stabilization of key geographies like India and Europe, continued improvement in the U.S as we've noted today that kind of we're encouraged by what's happened more recently in the United States and looking for that to continue. But no question that a number of the new product launches should play a really important role. Like I said on the call and referred to in some earlier comments, we\u2019re in the early stages of a multiyear innovation cycle. Like I said, the launches we\u2019ve seen in 2018 have been more numerous than the two prior years combined. We are only beginning to see the positive impacts on those and some of those are more incremental. But as we move into next year and beyond, we see evermore significant launches as we continue to progress some of the core building blocks of next generation technology sets, and that's really the heart of our transformational engineering initiative and so much of the heavy lifting that we've been doing in our R&D efforts. And I have a lot of confidence in that pipeline and I'm looking forward to it making a bigger and bigger difference.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. And on the capital deployment front, a follow-up. Historically, was obviously been a very organic growth story and you talked about 2.5x net leverage even with the share buybacks that leaves the room for relatively sizable deal. What gives you confidence that you will be able to execute that and integrate that, have the bench for it? And then also how should we think about potential targets? You are relatively focused in a few very specific products and markets. Are you thinking about complementary deal to something in the technology space, or are you looking outside of your core -- sort of core areas?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, Mike that's a fair question on M&A and I would just continue to reiterate that our core corporate strategy is really around specialty focus and innovation leadership and we do -- we are taking probably a broader look at how we can emphasize the strength of our core products and enhance the strength of our core products with some tuck-in type M&A. Certainly, if we go down that path, we would do so in a very selective manner, in a very purposeful way that reinforces our core strategy. And like you say, while we have the -- we certainly have the financial wherewithal to stay flexible, to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves and at the same time we are building capability within the Company through our new corporate development department, and how we\u2019d look to operationalize that, but until there was something specific to talk about, I would just leave it at that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thanks. Good morning. Chris, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the chemistry results in the quarter and as it pertains to that small molecule. I\u2019m curious if you're seeing any change in the market, whether it would be related to price or volume and just what -- if you could elaborate a little bit more on the chemistry result in the quarter?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Thanks, Jack. From an overall chemistry standpoint where we grew mid single digits, we were up against a double-digit comp in prior year. So while the chemistry number tends to bounce around a little bit, based on prior year and prior quarter, we feel very solid in our chemistry business. We were quite strong in Pharma, which we think is a good indicator of underlying health of that market. We had strength in our application kits in our UPLC columns and I mentioned some new Bioseparations columns, such as the BioResolve reversed-phase that was partially offset by a little softness in consumables for clinical diagnostics and then just the vagaries of customer ordering. So really it's [indiscernible] goes in the chemistry consumables area and it's a really important part of our business.","Jack Meehan","Great. Thanks. Just one follow-up on China. It sounds like the growth was good in the quarter, but curious if you're seeing anything on the ground related to trading tariffs and what would your expectation for the fourth quarter growth be?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, I think it's fair question on China. We\u2019ve seen a very balanced contribution of China all year long and we continue to expect China to perform at a high level. We have a lot of balance in our Chinese business between end markets, we are actually more diversified in China, if you will, than other major geographies. From a tariff standpoint, because the vast majority of our products trade in tariffs really, vast majority of our products come in from places other than the United States, we've seen less of a direct effect. I did mention earlier that the TA Instruments product line, which is the one product line for us that comes in from the United States has seen some delays between the order and sales cycle or elongated sales cycle. Whether or not that\u2019s tied to the trade type activities, we are watching that closely. But when we step back and look at the big picture of China, when it all comes together, it's been a very solid story all year long and our current assumptions call for the continuation of that trend.","Jack Meehan","Great. Thanks, Chris.","Christopher O'Connell","So it is a little bit after the top of the hour, so maybe we will conclude the call here in a few minutes. And as I do that, I do want to thank everybody for your great questions. In conclusion, after our third quarter, we are focused on delivering on our growth objectives for the fourth quarter, headlined by the continued improvement within our U.S pharmaceutical category, resumption of growth in TA Instruments and broad based growth in China. We are at the beginning of an exciting new product cycle across the business and believe that market conditions and our strong competitive position support continuing success. So on behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2018 call, which we currently anticipate holding on January 23, 2019. Thank you all and have a great day.","Operator","We thank you all for your participation in today\u2019s conference. That will conclude the call. You may now disconnect.

This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","I\u2019d like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter 2014 financial results conference call. With me on today\u2019s call is Gene Cassis, the Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations.","And as is our normal practice, I\u2019ll start with an overview of the quarter\u2019s business, and then Gene will follow with details of our financial results and then update you with our outlook for the fourth quarter. But before we get going, I\u2019d like Gene to cover the cautionary language.","Gene Cassis","Thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the Company, this time for the fourth quarter and full-year 2014. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, please see our Form 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the Company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 2015.","During this call, we\u2019ll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly compatible GAAP measures is attached with the Company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results and operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which include the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials also included in this morning\u2019s press release. Doug?","Douglas Berthiaume","Thanks, Gene. Well, I am pleased to tell you that our third quarter results exceeded our expectations. Continued strong demand from our global pharmaceutical customers contributed to faster sales growth rates in most regions of the world. Margins in the quarter benefited from higher sales volume and favorable product mix dynamics. In all operating leverage in the quarter in combination with steady share repurchases, resulted in mid teens adjusted EPS growth.","When you look at the third quarter, our constant currency sales were up 8% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 16%. That's clearly an improvement over the strong results we delivered in the second quarter. For the Waters Division, organic sales growth was 9% and benefited from stronger shipment volume to pharmaceutical end markets.","Overall sales were broadly defined pharmaceutical segment were up 12% in the quarter and 7% through the first nine months of 2014. Global government and academic business also picked up nicely in the quarter with growth in the U.S and Europe leading the way.","We anticipate the government funded instrument sales in the U.S and Europe will remain strong in the fourth quarter and see some opportunity for improved demand from government and academic labs and our larger Asian markets, especially for our more advanced mass spectrometry based instruments.","Our Waters Division industrial chemical and chemical analysis businesses declined at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, due primarily to weaker demand in Asia and weaker cyclical demand for food safety applications.","Coming into the quarter, we remain focused on monitoring business conditions in China. Earlier in the year, delays in placing orders at governmentally funded institutions, contributed to overall declines in China sales. In the third quarter, we saw a continuation of this business trend and finished the quarter with a mid single-digit decline in sales, although a modest increase in orders. Though customer interest continues to be strong, we do not expect to see a dramatic change in the fourth quarter and will incorporate a conservative short-term outlook in our guidance.","Sales growth in the U.S was encouraging in the third quarter. For the Waters Division, sales were up 9%, the same growth rate as we delivered in the second quarter. Growth was strongest in our pharmaceutical and governmentally funded segments and elsewhere in the Americas business trends continued to be very positive across most customer segments.","Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan increased slightly in the quarter, with strong growth in pharmaceutical and solid growth in industrial chemical accounts somewhat tempered by declines in public sector spending, and that's a trend that we saw also in the second quarter.","In India, we saw a continuation of healthy double-digit sales growth as generic drug firms resumed adding new instruments and replacing old ones. In addition, our service business in India benefited from strong demand for validation services as drug firms there are actively taking steps to ensure regulatory compliance.","Our European Waters Division sales at constant currency were up 9% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid single-digits while our government and academic business accelerated and grew with a strong double-digit rate.","Looking at our TA Instruments Division, global sales were up 3% in the quarter. The slower sales growth can be explained by a strong mid-teens growth this division delivered in the prior year\u2019s quarter making the comparisons difficult. Geographically sales in Europe and Japan was stronger this quarter, while more challenging business conditions in China and in smaller developing countries slowed TA\u2019s overall growth. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect constant currency growth at a stronger mid single-digit rate for TA.","Now, I'll talk some of our Waters Division product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew 9% in the third quarter. Waters\u2019 service business was generally strong across all major regions and the trend towards higher penetration for service contracts was apparent in the quarter\u2019s results.","On the chemistry front, our Column business benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Our new line of CORTECS columns has been very well received and we've recently expanded our high-performance column offerings for biotherapeutics.","Waters Division instrument systems sales grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter. Demand improved across most regions and especially for pharmaceutical applications, and for governmentally funded and academic labs. Overall, demand for research-focused UPLC MS systems was up double digits and particularly for proteomics and phenomics applications. Our new UPLC QTof system, the Xevo G2-XS introduced earlier this year at ASMS has been very well received across a wide range of lifescience applications.","On the tandem quadrupole front, we\u2019ve just began shipping our recently introduced Xevo TQ-S micro late in the third quarter. This new instrument delivers a unique combination of performance in value and a compact benchtop design and shipments in the fourth quarter expected to contribute nicely to our overall instrument systems growth.","In addition, third quarter sales of our highest performance tandem quadrupole system, the Xevo TQ-S, significantly benefited from our new ionKey source technology. As you may recall, this technology integrates high-performance tile-based UPLC separations technology with our StepWave ion source to effect dramatic improvements in analytical sensitivity. Sales for this technology have been particularly strong at select international drug firms for early to mid stage drug development applications, and we believe that successes at these accounts will drive wider adoption.","Speaking about mass spec technology, I'm pleased to tell you that we acquired the assets of MediMass in July. This acquisition provides us with an ion source technology called Rapid Evaporation Ionization Mass Spectrometry or REIMS for short. Though this new technology has value across a wide array of research applications and is complimentary to other atmospheric pressure ionization techniques that we offer, we are very excited about the longer-term benefits of REIMS to our recently announced health science initiative. This initiative which we formally organized earlier this year recognizes an important transition in medical research that demands a suite of usable advanced technologies, including research grade mass spectrometry to attain a more comprehensive understanding of disease.","This molecular based understanding will result in more effective predictive diagnostic and therapeutic dose to cost-effectively manage human health. For example, leading oncology researchers in North America, Europe, and Asia are envisioning technologies such as REIMS not only for research and diagnostic workflows, but also for surgical procedures wherein careful extraction of cancerous tissue can be more effectively accomplished with a specialized REIMS probe integrated with a surgeon\u2019s scalpel. This [ph] [ionized] concept currently underdevelopment, exemplifies the long-term potential for innovations in mass spectrometry in improving medical outcomes.","More broadly, our health science initiative is recasting Waters as a key player in next-generation medical research. Working with leading researchers across the globe, we\u2019re developing new workflows to more effectively cross reference proteomic, metabolomic and phenomic data to better predict characterize and diagnose disease. Going forward, we believe we established a strong basis and differentiated position to achieve market leadership and a rapidly growing and profitable business opportunity.","Return now to the recent quarter, on the chromatography front, all major system offerings performed well in the quarter. ACQUITY instrument system sales benefited from yet another strong quarter for ACQUITY QDa mass detector shipments. And the primary application area for this new detection technology is in the area of small molecule drug research, and in the third quarter, we saw drug research customers purchase the QDa as a detection module for existing UPLC or HPLC systems as well as within new system orders. The sales ramp up of the ACQUITY QDa is on track to generate about $20 million in sales in its first calendar year on the market.","Now I\u2019d like to briefly discuss the outlook for the fourth quarter. Against a strong prior year comparison, we expect constant currency sales growth in the mid single-digit range. This level of growth will allow the Company to finish the year with a top line performance that's consistent with our original guidance, which as you may recall did not anticipate slower growth in China.","For the Waters Division, we believe that the strength of pharmaceutical demand that we\u2019ve witnessed for the past two quarters is sustainable and that our recurring revenue will continue to deliver predictable growth through the fourth quarter. We are also encouraged by the success of our new product launches, including the ACQUITY QDa, and our new Xevo mass spectrometry platforms. In addition, there are near-term and significant opportunities associated with the health science initiative that I discussed earlier.","On the M&A front and for the Waters Division, we continue to see opportunities to benefit our long-term initiatives in applications such as food safety testing, microbiology, and clinical diagnostics by licensing and acquiring innovative technologies. For our TA Division, we will likely continue a consistent and focused business acquisition plan. However, given our primary focus on driving organic growth, we plan to continue to deploy the lion\u2019s share of our strong cash generation on our share repurchase program.","Finally on the leadership transition front, we continue to actively progress in the search for my successor. Our primary focus is to ensure a smooth transition and I look forward to sharing information on developments on this topic, probably during the next few earnings calls.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Gene for a review of our financials and an update on our outlook.","Gene Cassis","Thank you, Doug, and good morning all. In the third quarter, our sales came in at $493 million, an increase of 8% over last year\u2019s with currency translation neutral to sales. On a non-GAAP basis, our earnings per diluted share were up 16% to $1.38. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $1.34 versus $1.14 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that we issued this morning.","Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency exchange effects, U.S. sales were up 8%, Europe was up 9%, Japan was up 4%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 5%. Strong sales growth in India helped offset a 5% decline in China. Rest of World sales notably including Latin America were up 15%.","On the product front, and again in constant currency terms and within the Waters Division, instrument system sales increased by 8% and our recurring revenues grew by 9%. In all of the Waters Division, sales were up 9%. For our TA instruments Division, constant currency sales including instruments and services increased 3% again off of a tough base of comparison.","Now, I\u2019d like to comment on our third quarter\u2019s non-GAAP financial performance versus the third quarter of the prior year. Gross margins came in at 59% versus 58.1% in the third quarter last year as mix dynamics and continued manufacturing productivity gains offset some currency headwinds.","SG&A expenses were up about 3% on a constant currency basis with the impact of currency translation being about neutral. R&D expenses increased by 13% before foreign currency translation, and a stronger British pound, in particular, added another 3%.","On the tax front, we now expect our full-year operating tax rate to be around 14%. Applying this tax rate to our cumulative earnings, pushes our effective operating tax rate for the third quarter to 13.1%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $7 million and share account came in at 84.4 million shares or approximately 2 million shares lower than in our third quarter last year, a net result of our share repurchase programs.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.95 billion, and debt totaled $1.4 billion bringing us to a net cash position of $516 million. As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 735,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $76 million. In all, we have approximately $843 million in repurchases remaining on previously authorized programs.","We define cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the third quarter, free cash flow came in at $106 million after funding $17 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is $2 million of investments associated with facility expansion.","Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, down 1 day from the third quarter of last year. In the quarter, inventories decreased by $4 million in comparison to the second quarter so sequentially.","As we think about our expectations, for the fourth quarter of 2014, and considering the strong quarterly comparison, we anticipate constant currency sales growth to moderate from the third quarter\u2019s rate and come in at the 4% to 5% range. Currency translation at today's rate would reduce sales by about 2%.","Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the fourth quarter are expected to sequentially improve from the third quarter of 2014. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled. Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $8 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at about 14%.","Rolling all these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within the range of $1.83 to $1.93 in the fourth quarter. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first nine months of this year, we anticipate full-year 2014 constant currency sales growth of about 5% and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. These results assume the following: a modest full-year currency translation headwind to sales of less than 1%, a negative currency impact of full-year EPS of about 3%, a full-year operating tax rate of around 14%, and finally a full-year share count of about 85 -- an average share count of 85 million shares outstanding.","That\u2019s it from me. Doug?","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you, Gene. Carolyn, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ross Muken from ISI Group. Your line is open.","Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC","Good morning and congrats guys.","Douglas Berthiaume","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC","So maybe let\u2019s start on the pharma side, this was obviously a really strong print and the year-to-date numbers are obviously quite good as well. As we think about through the components terms of the pharma sub sector is [ph] [zero], biotech pharma, small pharma et cetera, where are you seeing the biggest upside surprise and to what do you sort of attitude, I guess, that magnitude change as we have kind of progressed through the year, which it seems like it\u2019s kind of gotten better?","Douglas Berthiaume","Yes, Ross it has gotten a little bit better. I think it\u2019s fair to say. I'd say clearly this quarter India's return in the generic drug marketplace has certainly been strong. So that's a segment that we certainly saw here. Our biggest pharmaceutical accounts are up mid single-digit to little bit better. So that\u2019s an encouraging outcome for big pharma who are of course relying on specialty pharma more. Biotech and specialty would probably in the mid line area of our market, the strongest performers over and above the large integrated traditional pharma accounts. So generics and then specialty and bio and then big pharma as we\u2019d characterize it probably in that order.","Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC","Thanks. And then, maybe just turning to China, which has obviously been a huge focus and I think disappointing for many other than yourself. I mean, as you look at that market, what are you keyed in on -- in any of the end markets in terms of giving you any signs of hope maybe of a stabilization or improvement or where would you expect to see I guess the inflection first that may give you a better signal that at least some parts of that market may heal and improve versus other parts that are probably more structurally challenged going forward?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, in our business the piece that\u2019s most challenged is the one that's directly government funded and supported. The piece of the China business that's expat, the large integrated companies is doing just fine. So it's clearly a government dynamic that's affecting China. And it\u2019s pretty broad; it's not like a segment that is happening in research pharmaceuticals versus food safety or versus environmental. I'd say they're all being affected and I don't think one is being disproportionately singled out where it's a cut back in healthcare spending or I think it\u2019s just this general concern that is capsulized in this crack down on corruption that I think its generally resulted in almost everybody in the approval chain taking longer to make sure all i\u2019s are dotted, t\u2019s are crossed and even when they\u2019re they go back for a second and third check. So I think the encouraging thing is that our orders rate grew in the quarter. We are certainly still seeing the underlying demand there and it\u2019s hard to believe that this whole condition can stay in the current condition too much longer. And as we said, we\u2019re not anticipating a rapid turnaround in the fourth quarter, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some let up come soon.","Ross Muken - ISI Group LLC","Great. Thanks, Doug for the commentary.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Leerink. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann & Company","Thank you. As you think about your forecast for 2014 in China is coming in weaker, what is the primary offset that offsets that versus your view which enables you to make up for the weakness in China?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, I\u2019d say generally in terms of trade classes its pharma that has continued to be a little bit stronger. We were probably always more optimistic than the analyst community, but it's probably even a few points stronger than that. I also think this broadly define healthcare initiative that we\u2019ve talked about paying real premiums in a -- as the world continues to invest in genomics technology clearly, but also recognizing that proteomics, metabolomics, phenomics is going to be an important part of delivering meaningful diagnostics in therapeutics. They\u2019re really ramping up the investment in mass spectrometry, particularly in the large-scale academic medical centers where we\u2019ve had, boy, a huge amount of interest, significant order rate, and a drop sheet or interest level that\u2019s very significant. So I think that piece of the healthcare marketplace is very strong and you see that reflected in our results and in our expectations going forward.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann & Company","That's helpful. Thanks. And for my follow-up, Doug, you made some comments in your prepared remarks about a cyclical downturn or cyclical weakness in the food safety market. I was just hoping you could elaborate. Is that wrapped up in the China phenomenon as well, or is there something different going on there?","Douglas Berthiaume","It's definitely significantly affected by China, and that we see in our orders in the quarter. But we\u2019ve seen that food safety can be lumpy. If you look at it for the year, we clearly have a good year in the broadly described food market, but quarterly, you can find that Thailand booked $2 million order last year and won\u2019t book again for another year or something like that. So we find these lumps of business, some of which we anticipate and some of which kind of slip from one quarter to another Dan. So, but calling it cyclical is probably a broad term that -- probably fair to call it more lumpy quarter-to-quarter.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Swann & Company","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one is on the healthcare and the clinical end market, which I think you just talked about, Doug, and it did come up in the prepared remarks. This is something we\u2019re hearing a lot more about from Waters. It\u2019s not apparent that there is a lot of incremental investment at the R&D line or SG&A line related to that focus, although I\u2019m sure there is some embedded in the numbers. I\u2019m just curious, can growth in this end market occur at a meaningful and sustained rate without a whole lot of incremental investment in product development and\/or channel? Just trying to think about how we model this really promising growth opportunity not just at the top line, but also at the operating line and, I guess, while we are on this topic, could you just provide an update on what percentage of sales this accounts for right now?","Douglas Berthiaume","Sure, Doug. I think in terms of the strategic approach to this market, you're seeing two things. One of which is something that we\u2019ve traditionally done and you\u2019ve seen us do for 25 years is we reallocate the resources at both the R&D level and at the marketing level to focus, we can move it as we think we\u2019ve matured in one area and we can move resources into this clinical initiative. You can see from our growth in R&D, we have begun to increase R&D somewhat, but that's always been a hallmark of ours that we can redirect and then squeeze more out of our R&D spending than you might otherwise suspect. The other thing, you\u2019ve heard of me talk about the acquisition of MediMass and the REIMS technology and the iKnife. So we\u2019ve not dipped our toes dramatically into the acquisition for product or for acquisition sake. That\u2019s something that others are pretty good at and we kind of focus our acquisition on technology or specific missing elements of our product portfolio. So we\u2019ve done it with REIMS and MediMass, we did it with the TransOmics acquisition about 14 months ago. And we do it with partnerships, particularly with thought leaders in academia or in academic medical centers. That's been a particularly rich source with cancer centers here in the United States, with thought leaders in China, some of the biggest thought leaders in the world there, and in Europe. So, we\u2019ve had very close relationships in those institutions and we can therefore leverage their brains and their willingness to work as partners in development of many of these technologies. So, yes, we might find ourselves on the margin having to allocate more resources, but we think we can do it within our P&L models without dramatically affecting our results.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, I guess, my second question is on the succession plans. When you initially announced the plan to find a successor, you were clear in providing a window of about two years. So, there is still a decent amount of time left in that window and you've been clear it possibly could stretch. That said, I think it is fair to assert that many are surprised this is taking as long as it has, especially when you said in your prepared remarks you expect to have an update over the next few quarters. Could you just provide a bit more clarity on how this process is proceeding? And then, I guess secondly, I would think the longer this goes on the greater the risk that organizational uncertainty could become more of an operational concern. Do you agree? And if so, how are you managing this? Thank you.","Douglas Berthiaume","Okay. I think it\u2019s a very fair question and I\u2019m sure, you are probably the only one interested in this question Doug, but I\u2019ll focus on it. The process is one where the Board of Directors is assigned a subcommittee of the Board who is principally responsible for the process. I participated with that committee as well as three other members of the Board including our lead Director. We have hired executive recruiters, and we have been proceeding through that kind of normal phase of going through phase one with candidates, getting names, betting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, having initial interviews, then having second interviews. I would say that the process is not particularly troublesome from our perspective. Yes, we\u2019ve had some candidates that we thought were going to be very good and might have proceeded very quickly, and then either they dropped out of the process for their own internal reasons or towards the end of a process we got cold feet and have moved on. I\u2019d say, the process is kind of either on or off, and until we\u2019re ready to announce a transition either internal and as the process goes along the opportunity for an internal candidate to step up becomes somewhat higher in probability or an external candidate. And you know every day as these mergers happen in our space and people don\u2019t want to work for a bigger company, the population of potential becomes richer. And so we\u2019re examining new candidates on that front kind of people who have more proven r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and so I think the committee is very comfortable with the state of the process, with the richness of the shortlist that we\u2019re working. We\u2019re interviewing candidates on a weakly basis. But to some extent, I have always been comfortable with this window. I have always thought that it was going to take longer probably rather than shorter. As you can see it doesn\u2019t seem to be hurting our results and we\u2019re -- the organization listens to that story, is comfortable with it. And I think the evidence is that it continues to deliver excellent results across the Board. So, yes, maybe as the process winds along, you worry about continued performance, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sign that, that performance is eroding. It\u2019s quite the opposite. The performance is improving. And there\u2019s no indication that we will be bereft senior leadership as this process goes along. We\u2019ll continue to run it the way we\u2019ve run it for 20 plus years and sooner or later we\u2019ll have a good quality successor in place and we\u2019re not uncomfortable with the particular level of uncertainty that exists today.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company","All right, thanks Doug. That\u2019s really helpful and congrats on the quarter.","Douglas Berthiaume","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Good morning. Thanks Doug. A question for you just on long-term product design. You guys had it done in franchise for many years. As you pointed out the results continue to be strong. What is your philosophy around where the HPLC market is going from here and specifically what can you do to add value both in your pharmaceutical customers and in the research markets? We\u2019ve had UPLC as a great technology for a while. What do you think -- how do you think about adding value from here forward?","Douglas Berthiaume","Isaac, I think, maybe unlike some others in the industry we always believe that this is a very dynamic technology. Others thought 15, 20 years ago that you had to focus on cost reduction and the cost of ownership that the technology couldn\u2019t deliver more bank for the buck in terms of speed, sensitivity or resolution. I think the most clear example that that was wrongheaded was ACQUITY and UPLC that brought substantial new benefits to the user of chromatography. You look at our introduction of ionKey technology, the separation device particularly for use in the mass spec arena and early on the drug company users are astonished by the kind of user friendliness and benefits in terms of chromatographic results that result from that. I think you\u2019ll continue to see benefits in that kind of technology, as well as just improved speed, improved separation products. One of the benefits that Waters brings here is our substantial capabilities in separations technology in the column technology. And that\u2019s resulted in these things like ionKey and being able to configure chemistry in more novel delivery packages that prove useful for the consumer. You look at UPC2 technology, the use of supercritical fluids for bringing an additional tool to the benchtop and to be fair, we thought the UPLC2 was going to earlier on play a more dominant role, but I\u2019ll tell you this past quarters UPC2 grow at a substantial rate, and we think that the future for UPC2 in any number of applications is going to significantly improve the toolkit for analytical chemists and will contribute to our growth rate substantially. And I haven\u2019t even talked about data and the ability of novel new software and application protocols to bring the kind of benefit particularly in this healthcare initiative as we look at diagnostics and the research market place. So, no one has invested the kind of resources that we have in providing novel both chromatography and mass spec analysis capabilities into the healthcare marketplace and you\u2019ll see that continue to push the market place forward. I\u2019m sure if I\u2019ve forgotten two or three important things that we\u2019re also working on, principally in the hardware and the core pumping, injecting, detecting arena. So, I mean, I\u2019m very excited about it and I think you can tell that we think we\u2019re still perched on a future that\u2019s very strong growth because of all these initiatives.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","It\u2019s very helpful, Doug. Just as a follow-up to that, the reason I asked the question is, obviously with the transition in management coming up there is I think some curiosity about long-term innovation in the business. So, if we total up all the things that you talked about between ionKey and UPC2 and software and diagnostics, I mean, if we look three and five years down the road, do you think those initiatives will combine to be let's say more than 20% of your business? Or just trying to think about where it\u2019s going over the long-term? Are these initiatives together going to be critical mass such that you have a whole new leg to the business or at least a new complexion to the total exposure of your product line?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well I think what you\u2019re going to see is this melding of pharmaceutical and clinical care. Right now kind of the pharmaceutical business is to take care of drug development kind of and then hand it over to clinical care specialists and that kind of discreet markets more and more the combination of genetics and phenomics in drug discovery and drug development and clinical care are merging together. And I think the combination of those things is something that works in our favor because we are important players in certainly all elements of that in particularly a growing presence with our healthcare initiative. So, I think it will be a little bit tough to discern how much is kind of in a more traditional Waters modality and how much is kind of new work with cancer centers and diagnostic initiatives. But clearly we think a disproportionate amount of growth over the next five years is going to come out of these new partnerships and clinical care initiatives that result from phenomics and treatment modalities that are going to emerge.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","All right. We\u2019ll look for those. Thanks a bunch.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Paul Knight from Janney Capital. Your line is open.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets","Hi, guys, this is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Paul. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess to start, I was a little surprised on the strength in European academic. I expected you coming off of a soft comp, but I expected some incremental acceleration here, but the strong I think you guys said double-digit growth was ahead of my expectations. So I just want to get some color there. And what are you guys hearing from customers on the ground in that government academic sector in Europe? Because I've also heard some budget numbers were released that weren't adhering to the EU restriction regulations on GDP ratios for next year. So just thoughts on whether it was flushing as well or commentary would be very helpful.","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, I\u2019ll ask Gene to handle some more color, but I think the -- its interesting that in Europe you\u2019ll hear us talk about broad base throughout this discussion. But clearly it was broad based in Europe. I mean almost every geography in Europe delivered good results this quarter. So it wasn\u2019t just a U.K. initiative or German initiative. It was kind of throughout Europe we saw this kind of response and it was -- some of it was pent up, some of it was clearly as a result of the new products that we\u2019re bringing into the market. And our sense is that, this is not a one quarter dynamic. Gene, you want to go into the details.","Gene Cassis","Yes. I think you did a pretty good job, Doug. But I would just add some color that, a lot of the strength that we saw in our European markets centered around our new QTof mass spec commentary offerings, and I think its somewhat of a product specific or a system specific strength that we had in that business. So, a combination of funding levels and a very competitive position based on new product launches primarily in high end mass spec commentary will grow the European government in academic growth.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets","Okay. And just a couple follow-ups to that. Would you say sentiment is still pretty strong then on outward looking for your customers? And then, I guess the other kind of two quick ones I have, follow-up is -- your orders were strong in China at the end of 2Q, you\u2019re citing strength in orders again 3Q, maybe a modest improvement in 4Q on revenues from China. When do think those orders will be pulled through? Is it more of a 6 to 9 tail? And I guess, I\u2019ll leave it at that, there is plenty of other people in the queue.","Douglas Berthiaume","I think it\u2019s hard to tell given the strength of the concern on the product customers with this whole corruption crackdown and concern. I think its good sign that we\u2019re able to actually book these orders, but it\u2019s still tough to get through the payment processes and the bank clearances in order to get revenue recognition. So, that\u2019s where the Nitty hits the Gritty I\u2019d say in this process. And until we see a more broad based sign of that, again this is largely in the Beijing area in the government controlled segment, but we haven\u2019t seen that loosen up yet.","Gene Cassis","The color that I\u2019d add to that is that we probably saw the biggest change in trajectory in the first quarter, and for the last two quarters we have seen a level of stability in demand. I\u2019ll bite at a lower level than traditionally we\u2019ve seen in that marketplace, but we have a backlog build and so I think there is some reason for some cautious optimism as we go into the fourth quarter that we\u2019ll see some of these shipments in revenues be recognized.","Douglas Berthiaume","Okay.","Bryan Kipp - Janney Capital Markets","Thank you.","Gene Cassis","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Hi, thanks, good morning. Just a question on the LC business also. Obviously you built a very strong franchise and the results clearly reflect that. I'm just curious, I know there have been some new competitive entries there. So perhaps you could talk about kind of the competitive landscape and maybe pricing as well, just given obviously the market is becoming or has been quite attractive. Have you seen any changes either on the competitive or pricing front? And then going forward how do you kind of view Waters' position from a competitive standpoint?","Douglas Berthiaume","Sure Amanda. I think to be fair, we face competitive offerings regularly in this industry. And I do think it\u2019s fair to say that many in the industry have been playing catch up to come up to par with our kind of offerings. So it\u2019s not surprising that people make a fanfare about their latest product offering. It\u2019s a little unusual to have such a fanfare post pick on where most people plan to deliver their new products. But it\u2019s a normal occurrence to us. I think you can see from our results that pricing is not suffering. Our margins, we\u2019re strong in the quarter. We don\u2019t see and frankly we -- we\u2019ve been asked this question year-in and year-out about price sensitivity. We have to compete, but very rarely do we see our overall price strategy suffering as a result of new product introductions by anyone. There have been low cost competitors, low priced competitors out there from time and memorial. They will always exist, but they don\u2019t typically have a significant impact on us. And I don\u2019t know, if they\u2019re having significant inroads in the LC market place then God bless them, then market must be even stronger than we think it is for us to be delivering almost 10% growth than them taking share. So, I\u2019ll leave that to you to decide whether that\u2019s happening.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Got it, okay. And then just on the bench -- you've obviously -- well, you talked a little bit about getting some traction with the new benchtop mass spec platform that you launched recently. Maybe you could talk about that particular opportunity. Have you thought about how to frame that in terms of size? What it could add ultimately for Waters\u2019 over time?","Gene Cassis","Yes, I\u2019ll take a stab at that Amanda. We did talk about strength on the sales line for our new QTof offering, but we just began shipping the tandem quadrupole offering late in the third quarter. I think you can appreciate that within mass spec commentary tandem quadrupole sometimes called triple quadrupole mass spec commentary represents the largest market segment. And our new Xevo TQ-S micro really hits the heart of that market place. And we expect that in the fourth quarter you\u2019ll see us ship against a backlog that we\u2019ve built and show some nice strength in applications ranging from DMPK applications through the applied market. So, all through this year we\u2019ve had nice strength based on systems with the QDa. We\u2019ve had very good strength on QTof offerings at the high end, and now I think as we enter the fourth quarter we\u2019re going to be looking at the largest segment of the UPLC MS market and I think have a very strong offering.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Okay. Thanks very much.","Gene Cassis","You are welcome, Amanda.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Miroslava Minkova from Stifel. Your line is open.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Hi, Doug. Hi, Gene. Congrats on a very strong quarter. I wanted to go back to the pharmaceutical rebound. It seems like it is two quarters in a row now. And I was wondering if you could help us understand the drivers behind the rebound. Is it a replacement cycle that\u2019s occurring after several years of subdued demand? Is it the new instruments that you have launched? How would you characterize it and how sustainable do you think it is looking out?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well Miroslava, I think its all of those. I think that\u2019s the interesting part about the strength in the pharma market for Waters\u2019. Clearly in the India piece which is largely aimed at generic drug manufactures you\u2019ve had a multiple quarter period of slow growth going back prior to this year due to regulatory concerns, due to macroeconomic and political concerns. So that\u2019s a pent up replacement demand, its regulatory that\u2019s driving that market. When you look at the launch of the QDa detector clearly is a new product, new capability initiative that\u2019s -- but really mostly aimed at small molecule analysis and mostly in more traditional drug applications. You look at the introduction of our ionKey again aimed at drug development applications be both in biotech and in large pharma. You\u2019ll look at the strong service requirement which cuts across all of those and our service business in spite of companies that want to service all instruments in a company and those initiatives come and go. Our service business continues to be very strong as these companies continue to value the constant uptime of their instruments and what Waters\u2019 brings in that. So, I\u2019ll start getting redundant, so it\u2019s everything, it\u2019s really across the board.","Gene Cassis","I\u2019d just like to add one thing, that if you look at the change in trajectory for pharmaceutical demand, one to look at it and say it really started in the fourth quarter of last year. Even the first quarter of this year if I looked at pharmaceutical demand in North America and Europe that was at a mid single-digit rate, but the other, three of the last four quarters we have had results that are pretty similar to what we delivered in this most recent quarter.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay. Thanks for the comment. For Gene, sorry if I missed it, but could you please -- could you quantify the impact of currency on 4Q, EPS? And I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some insight into how you think at current rates it might play down into 2015 again on your bottom line?","Gene Cassis","Well, I\u2019m not going to speculate on 2015 at this point, but -- and looking at the third quarter just the way currency moved through the quarter afforded us pretty neutral impact of currency on the quarter that we just reported. As we look at the fourth quarter we\u2019re estimating that the effective foreign currency primarily based on what's outputting with the yen is going to result in some place between $0.02 and $0.03 worth of pain in the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s about the extent of it, Miroslava.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Gene Cassis","You are welcome.","Douglas Berthiaume","And Carolina, I think we\u2019re approaching the bottom of the hour. So, maybe we can take one more question.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Our final question or comment comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Hi, thanks guys. A question on REIMS, I know you highlighted this at ASMS. Can you talk a little bit, now that you own the technology about regulatory plans for the iKnife, anything on pricing? Does this add any sort of consumable stream? And then going back to Doug's question earlier, do you need to make any sort of channel investments here?","Douglas Berthiaume","Sure, I\u2019ll handle that. Gene wants to interject something here.","Gene Cassis","Yes. On the last question that we got on FX, when I talked about $0.02 or $0.03 that was versus prior guidance. If I look at the full year impact of currency on the fourth quarter its close to $0.06. So, I just wanted to make sure that that was clear.","Douglas Berthiaume","Okay. So, Tycho as it relates to the iKnife, this is a very intriguing technology. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working with Imperial College and the original developers who actually came out of Hungary but has been working together for a number of years now where our Manchester mass spec operation has had a close relationship with Imperial College and have developed this technology that\u2019s we think proprietary that enabled a surgeon to while he\u2019s working on cancerous tissue to send that molecular sample immediately to a mass spec to be told whether he is in good tissue or in cancerous tissue. That\u2019s the theory and particularly in cases like breast cancer and then neuro cancers where the importance of taking all tumor but not more than tumor is clinically imperative. The initial research results are very interesting shall I say. It\u2019s important to note that this is a research initiative now. Its being developed principally in London but the amount of interest that\u2019s coming out of all of our academic cancer centers I must say is compelling where almost every one who has looked as this is interested in pursuing it. I want to emphasize that this is a future initiative. This is not available for sale today. It\u2019s going to take development. We\u2019ve got to make some decisions over a multi-year period of how this thing comes to market? How it gets sold? What the relationships are? That\u2019s going to come subsequent to this year. But this technology not only useful for surgical applications but this REINS technology could be very useful and we\u2019re working with some large food companies on food safety of being able to tell adulterants in milk or whether a particular meat sample is horse meat or hamburger. Very interesting user friendly capabilities that we think could well be enabling. Those less regulated applications could come to market soon, probably in 2015 while the most clinical applications are likely to come later. So was that enough, Tycho?","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Yes, now that\u2019s helpful. And then for the follow-up, maybe for Gene. I know you don't really want to comment on 2015, but if I looked at Street's modeling about 90 bps of operating margin expansion. Given I guess, Doug what you just talked about in terms of development for iKnife, is that a reasonable assessment on the operating side for 2015? I'm just trying to understand how much we need to think about next year being a year of reinvestment, if you will.","Gene Cassis","Well, I think we typically talked about \u201915 on my January call. But when we talk about the Waters\u2019 model in general, we always try to talk about the opportunity to get a little bit of operating leverage and a top line growth of mid single-digit typically as the point where we start to be able to see some operating leverage. So, at this point I wouldn\u2019t suggest that you think about the year 2015 much differently than you have previously.","Douglas Berthiaume","Agreed. We don\u2019t think that this iKnife initiative maybe we\u2019ll have to reallocate some resources to support it. But we don\u2019t think it dramatically affects the traditional Waters\u2019 P&L model.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay, great. We\u2019ll leave it at that. Thank you.","Douglas Berthiaume","All right. Well thank you all for putting up with us this long. Before concluding the call I\u2019d just like to reiterate. I think why we\u2019re so excited. You clearly saw in this quarter us focus on the broad-basedness of our capabilities, broad based geographically. So almost everywhere except for China we saw our businesses produce very strong results. If you looked at our product lines, chemistry, service, instruments, LC instruments, mass spec instruments we saw our business perform well. And finally just look at the phase of our P&L, you\u2019ll see the sales growth, margins improving at a faster rate than sales, you\u2019d see SG&A held under control, but its not stifling the growth of the business. We\u2019re clearly investing more in R&D than anywhere else in the P&L. The buyback continues on the margin to affect better EPS growth. So, manifested very simply in that going back to the breadth of our business capabilities, I think the outlook is very promising. So, whether it\u2019s this management that will be with you for a while longer or the next one, I think the stewardship is in good hands. So thanks a lot. We\u2019ll update you on our next call.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Lynch","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter earnings conference call.","Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the third quarter and full year 2017. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2017.","During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the mostly directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro-forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Along with John Lynch, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, I will provide an overview of our Q2 and year-to-date operating results, as well as some broader commentary on our business.","Sherry will then review financial details for our reported results and provide an update on our full-year 2017 financial outlook. We will then open the lines for Q&A to take your questions.","Jumping right in, I am pleased with our second quarter results where we delivered growth in all three of our major customer defined end markets of pharmaceutical, industrial and governmental and academic.","In addition, product sales were balanced with steady growth in our recurring revenue and our core LC, LC\/MS, and thermal analysis systems. Geographically we continued to see strength in Asia and Europe with slower demand in the Americas, though with improving trends in the United States.","Overall second quarter revenues grew at 5% against a strong base of comparison in the second quarter last year. Year-to-date, our sales were up 6% also against a strong comparison led by solid growth in our pharmaceutical markets and a continued improving demand from our industrial end markets.","Looking at our P&L, disciplined operating spending and operating efficiencies resulted in operating leverage, and therefore adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Additionally, we delivered another record quarter of free cash flow.","Taking a closer look and starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 4% in the quarter against double-digit growth comparisons in the prior year.","Pharmaceutical demand continues to be driven by macro trends of rising global regulatory standards, increasing worldwide patient access to medical therapy, and growing volume of more demanding biologic drug testing.","For the first half of the year, overall sales for our pharmaceutical markets were up 6% against a strong prior year performance with balanced growth from small molecule quality control testing applications and large molecule research workflows.","Sales to our worldwide industrial category, which includes the materials characterization, food, environmental, and fine chemical markets were strong and balanced in the second quarter, growing at 7% against a strong performance in the prior year.","This result continues the positive momentum we saw in the closing months of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. Year-to-date sales in our industrial category were up 8%, representing a strong first half to the year. As we see continued evidence of a cyclical recovery in global industrial demand, we believe we are well positioned in our chosen markets.","Looking at our governmental and academic category, we saw sales grow by 5% in Q2, driven primarily by an improvement in Asian and European markets related to environmental and medical research applications.","As we've discussed before, the governmental and academic category is a small percentage of our overall business and quarter-to-quarter growth can be highly variable given the nature of purchasing activity and our product mix, particularly in the United States. That said, we are starting to see signs of increased activity with US government funded accounts.","Now I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instrument sales grew 3% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. We continued to see strong growth from our ACQUITY Arc, a system that scientists \u2013 a system for scientist working with established methods who are looking for the versatility and robustness required to bridge the gap between HPLC and UPLC, while continuing to support validated assays.","Benchtop LC Tandem mass spec systems, including our recently introduced higher end Xevo TQ-XS, as well as the popular Xevo TQ-S micro continued to grow solidly in the quarter and year-to-date, primarily in food safety and biopharmaceutical applications.","Overall, we continue to see mass detection adopted for broader uses, such as routine pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical applications, including strong utilization of both ACQUITY QDa and the TQ-S micro.","These market trends are driving our strategy to integrate LC and M-S technologies, along with advanced informatics and chemistries into true system solutions.","While not a new theme for Waters, enhancements to our LC\/MS workflows in improving the characterization of biologic drugs was an emphasis at this year's American Society of Mass Spectrometry Conference in Indianapolis, which I personally attended.","As you are aware, recurring revenues, the combination of service and precision chemistry now represent approximately 50% of our business. During the second quarter, we saw 7% growth in recurring revenues, driven by global strength from both service and chemistry offerings. Year-to-date, our chemistry and service businesses have grown at 6%, indicating continued high utilization rates for the installed base of Waters instruments.","Turning to our TA product line, we are encouraged by the 6% growth for TA products and services in both the quarter and year-to-date. Instrument systems for TA grew 8% in the quarter, led by our new discovery line of thermal analyzers that we began to introduce in 2016.","Material scientists rely on TA for the highest performing instrumentation and the new discovery line embodies the most advanced thermal analysis technology for superior measurement outcomes.","Finally, I will review our performance by geography at the corporate level. As you know, we have a globally balanced portfolio. And Asia now represents our largest region in terms of revenue. In the quarter, Asia grew 14%, again, led by China which grew even faster and also included double-digit sales increases for both India and Japan.","Our China operation saw solid growth across all core markets. Within the pharmaceutical category, growth drivers continued to include new regulatory requirements from China\u2019s Food and Drug Administration.","In the industrial category, China experienced strong growth across our materials characterization, food testing, and environmental customers. Japan benefited from balanced sales growth from pharmaceutical, industrial, governmental, and academic markets.","Turning to the Americas. Sales declined by 3% in the quarter with our US sales down 2%. Macroeconomic and government policy uncertainties appear to be affecting general business activity in the United States.","While we are off to a slower than anticipated start, we did see improved trends in the US in Q2 versus Q1. We anticipate that our sales growth will continue to improve throughout 2017, based on an outlook for more normalized customer spending and as year-over-year comparisons become more favourable.","Europe was a strong contributor again with second quarter sales growth of 5% overall. Europe growth was led by pharmaceutical and government and in academic customers with product sales generally balanced across our instruments and recurring product lines.","Summarizing the state of our business through the first half of 2017, I am pleased that we are delivering strong mid-single digit revenue growth with operating leverage. Additionally, our double-digit earnings per share growth is tracking above our historical average.","Our key growth drivers of global pharma demand, Asia markets generally and the consistency of our recurring revenues remain intact. And I am especially encouraged with the robust balance of our growth combination, including the improvement of our overall industrial end markets.","Stepping back and looking at the bigger picture. I believe our strong and consistent results validate and reinforce the 5 elements of the Water's value creation model that we outlined in our Investor Day held in March of this year.","We hold a unique leadership position in structurally attractive markets. We have a clear growth strategy driven by organic innovation. We see opportunity for continuous operational improvement. We are a disciplined capital allocator and we operate with a performance oriented culture and management team.","Finally, I would like to update you on a few key changes within the Waters organization. First, in support of our ongoing efforts to leave the industry in innovation, we have integrated our Waters branded product groups into a single R&D organization under the leadership of Ian King. This important change combines our technology centers, including LC, mass spec, precision chemistries and informatics.","This move is driven by our transformational engineering vision that Ian introduced at our Investor Day, as well as our strategic plan that emphasizes integrated workflow solutions for our key customer defined business segments.","Ian is an experienced, broad based technical and business leader with particular expertise in chemistry and in instrumentation. Furthermore, this combined Waters Global Products Group provides a strong complement to the existing Waters Global Markets Group under the leadership of Mike Harrington, further emphasizing our focus on high value workflows and delivering on the needs of our increasingly global customers.","At the board level, we recently introduced and welcomed our newest Director Flemming Ornskov, Chief Executive Officer of Shire plc, a leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on serving people with rare diseases and other highly specialized conditions.","Dr. Lawrence Krauss [ph] broad global experience in the biopharmaceutical industry combined with his passion for improving human health positions him to make significant contributions to our growth strategy and makes him a great addition to our diverse and experienced board of directors.","With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of the second quarter financials. Sherry?","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. We recorded net sales in the second quarter of $558 million, an increase of about 5% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 1%. This resulted in 4% reported sales growth.","In the quarter, pharmaceutical markets grew 4%. Our industrial markets grew 7% and sales to academic and governmental customers were up 5%. Product line growth was strongest in our recurring revenue with a combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue growing 7%, while instrument sales grew 4% in the quarter.","Breaking that down further, sales relating to Water\u2019s branded products and services were up 5%, while TAs grew 6%. Combined LC and LC\/MS instrument platform sales increased by 3% and TAs instrumentation system sales grew 8%. As we continue to see the benefits of new product introductions. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7%.","Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and before currency translation, sales in Americas were down 3%, with sales in the US declining 2%. European sales were up 5%, sales in Asia were up 14% led by double-digit sales growth in China, India and Japan.","Now I'd like to comment on our second quarter\u2019s non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter were solid coming in at 58.9% consistent with the second quarter of 2016. Positive mix dynamics and product manufacturing efficiencies were offset by approximately 80 basis points of currency headwind.","Moving down the second quarters P&L, operating expenses were up 3% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency translation reduced operating expense growth by about 2% on a reported basis.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate before the effects of the new stock compensation rule for the quarter was 14.7%. This is the result of the mix of our legal entity profits in the quarter. Including a $0.05 benefit from new stock option accounting rules, the non-GAAP effective operating tax rate was 11.9%.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, down slightly from prior year. Our average share count came in at 80.8 million shares or approximately 700,000 shares lower than in the second quarter last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.","During the second quarter, we bought 430,000 shares of our common stock for $77 million. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the second quarter were up 11% to a $1.76, in comparison to earnings of a $1.58 last year.","On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.63 versus a $1.57 last year. Both our non-GAAP and GAAP earnings include a benefit of $0.05 resulting from the new stock compensation accounting rules.","The impact to foreign currency translation in the quarter on earnings per share was a negative $0.02, bringing the full year impact to neutral. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short term investments totalled $3.1 billion in debt totalled 1.9 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $1.2 billion. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items.","In the second quarter of 2017, cash flow was drawn and came in at $159 million after funding $17 million of capital expenditures. Modest improvements in working capital efficiency and disciplined capital spending contributed to our cash generation. This represents both a strong quarterly performance and year-to-date growth of approximately 14%.","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 75 days this quarter, which was down one day compared to Q2 of last year. In the quarter inventories were approximately flat in comparison to the prior year quarter, which was in line with our expectations.","As we look forward to the balance of the year, I'd like to share our full year and third quarter 2017 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes continued global growth and demand from our pharmaceutical and industrial end markets and consistent growth in our recurring revenue. Bringing this all together, we continue to expect a strong mid-single digit constant currency sales increase for the full year, which we consider to be in the range of 5% to 6%.","At current rates currency translation is assumed to reduce full year 2017 sales growth by about 1%. Our outlook for gross margins for the year is consistent with our previous guidance in the range of 58.5% to 59%.","Higher volume and manufacturing efficiency gains are expected to continue to be offset by negative effects from foreign currency translation. Our plan for the full year is to continue managing operating expense growth at a rate that is less than our sales growth.","Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $23 million. We estimate our full year tax rate, including an expected benefit to EPS of $0.18 due to stock option accounting rules to be about 12%.","This is comprised of the $0.14 benefit realized year-to-date, plus an assumed amount of $0.02 in each of the remaining two quarters of this year. Quarter-to-quarter variation is a result of the timing of actual stock option exercises and our stock price. We will continue to provide a reconciliation of this item for the remainder of 2017.","Our guidance regarding capital allocation assumes continuation of our share repurchase program through 2017 at a rate that will result in an average diluted share count of about 80 million shares outstanding.","Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2017 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $7.30 to $7.45. At current rate, foreign currency is assumed to negatively affect full year earnings per share growth by approximately 2%.","Looking at the third quarter of 2017, we expect constant currency sales growth of strong mid-single digits. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce third quarter sales growth by about 1%.","Combining these top line factors with a moderate increase in expenses and assume $0.02 of tax benefit due to the new accounting standard and an estimated 4% to 5% negative impact to adjusted EPS from currency translation at current rates, we estimate the third quarter earnings per diluted share in the range of a $1.68 to a $1.78.","Now I'd like to turn the call back to Chris. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Great. Thank you, Sherry. As we move through 2017 we will continue to emphasize execution in our core businesses and delivering on our operating performance objectives. As always we will strive for balance in our results and we will seek to cover unexpected changes in our assumptions with the breadth of our growth opportunities. Additionally, as we have stated consistently, we will seek to balance growth, operating leverage and investment in the business.","With that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions. So please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. And if you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes. Our first question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. [Operator Instructions] Steve, your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Can you hear me, okay?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. Hi, Steve.","Steve Willoughby","Hey, there guys. A couple of questions for you. First Chris, if you could just explain a little bit more about what you're seeing in I guess both the US, as well as with your pharma business. You know, I heard your comments you know, you're seeing some incremental positive signs in the US and expect better trends in the back half of the year.","Can you just talk a little bit about what you think is holding things up so far in the first half of the year and how you think that might be changing in the back of the year, and if that's related to your growth with pharma? And then I just have one follow up.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Yes, happy to address those and those are two related but different questions. So I'll just start with the US question and really the broad US market and the patterns we saw in the first half. Clearly, I think when we look at the US, we are looking at both the broader and business environment, but also our comps, which were strong in the second quarter here.","The US business environment is clearly seen across multiple markets, not just pharma, and you know, we do believe there is some holding back due to the uncertainties with government policy et cetera. Some companies are holding back and some companies are investing elsewhere. Clearly, the US is a little slower right now and Europe is a little faster.","As you pointed out, US was actually better in Q2 than Q1, not exactly where we wanted to be, but clearly heading in the right direction. And I think you know, it's looking at broad trends and the order book and demand, I would say that I'm cautiously optimistic that the US will normalize.","We think the demand is still there and are assuming some improvement in the back half of the year in the US, but certainly not assuming a strong big bounce. But we are assuming some improvement.","You know, as it relates to pharma and I think the best way to look at this picture is globally and is with the rolling trends. The quarter that we had in pharma I think reflects timing in comps. Recall that a year ago in the second quarter our pharma business worldwide grew 12% with strong comps in particular in Asia, and I think that if you look the slightly bigger picture of say a rolling six month or a rolling 12 month, our year-to-date pharma is up 6% in our last 12 months and pharma is up 8%.","And so you know, I think when I look at pharma, I think pharma is healthy and I think it's balanced on strong comps. So you know, looking at the back half, I think it's on track and expect at or above historical trend lines on a strong base from 2016. So that's how I\u2019d characterize the pharma picture overall.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. That's very helpful. Chris, thank you. The quick follow up I had is, just going back to comps. You know, I know you're going against I believe negative comps in your TA business in the back of the year.","And so you know, given the stronger instrument trends here in the second quarter, how are you thinking about the TA business overall and for the TA instruments going into the back half the year based on what you're seeing out there in the comps you have?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, thanks. You know, TA, I'm pleased with the TA in the year they're having. They've been solid in the first couple of quarters and as we've talked about in the event of a cyclical recovery in industrial demand. TA is very well positioned with their new product family, the Discovery Series.","And so you know, I was actually just out of TA a week ago with their worldwide management team, and I think the team is looking at the back half of the year with those factors and hopeful we'll continue to see good end markets and good -- you know contribution to the growth of the company.","Steve Willoughby","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Derik de Bruin. Hey, just to clarify, Sherry, can you just clarify one accounting question, and then I\u2019ll ask a more broader question. On the accounting question, so if the stock based comps tracked tax treatment for the second quarter, your prior guidance was $0.02, and when you updated last time it was $0.05, this quarter it was an incremental $0.03 is that how I'm looking at that?","Sherry Buck","That's correct.","Derik de Bruin","Okay. Just want to clarify that. All right. And then you know, you called out strong Japan, which is the first time I've actually heard anybody say strong Japan, those words in a long time. Can you sort of elaborate that and just also talk a little bit more about India. I know you - you're facing some tougher comps in that market as well. Can you sort of elaborate on that as well?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, Derik. You know, put both India and Japan in the broad category of Asia and as I pointed out, you know we really - feel good about Asia. It's our largest geography in terms of revenue contribution. It's been growing very steadily.","You know, Japan as we talked about last quarter had a little bit of a soft Q1, but that was as we talked about somewhat timing related in the later stages of what typically can be fiscal years in Japan and our tough comps, and is that - as some of those factors normalized in Q2, we saw a good solid performance actually in each of the end markets in Japan.","And so you know, Japan historically has been a relatively consistent and very reliable generator of modest growth and profitability. You know, we still expect that modest growth going forward, but are glad to see them post a solid quarter.","You know, as it relates to India, I think we're continuing to see consistency out of India really on the on the backs of the generic drug industry. We have a strong competitive position as you know in India, and the growth rates we're seeing though they are in the double digits really in the mid-teens continue to validate the economic engine that India is.","And in terms of providing the generic pharmaceutical base for many markets, and you know, there it's just a consistent performance on instruments, on service, on chemistry and we've got a very strong team there and expect to continue to see good things out of India.","Derik de Bruin","Is that India market most - still mostly alliance or is it shipped to ACQUITY Arc?","Christopher O'Connell","It's mostly alliance. It's mostly well established HPLC methods there in India. But you know, we are beginning to try to see you know some opportunity for ACQUITY Arc, but also keep in mind in India the Empower Chromatography Data System backbone for regulated methods is really the key factor.","As you know, regulatory standards in India have been rising. FDA has been taking a more active interest over the years in factories in India for the exporters into the US market and the Empower business has really solidified our leadership position there.","Derik de Bruin","Thank you very much.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug [Schenkel] from Cowen Company. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good morning. First, in Q1 US biopharma revenue growth was weak. You attributed this to slow budget releases, but at that point noted that trends had improved at the end of Q1 and in early Q2.","Based on your US growth performance for the quarter and pharma growth performance, it's not obvious that the trend of improvement that you described carried through the quarter.","So the question is did revenue tail off at the end of the quarter in the US relative to what you would have expected given the early momentum you described. And if so was this just pharma?","Christopher O'Connell","So to answer your first question Doug about Pharma, you know, I think when we're in the first quarter keep in mind it's our smallest quarter and we're hyper focused on early trends out of the gate. And so we do in the first quarter tend to look a little more that balanced to the quarter.","But you know with the benefit of looking at the first half you know, I think we tried to point out in my commentary that you know, the trends in the US are probably more reflective of the broad economic backdrop and questions and uncertainties in the US that many companies are facing.","And so you know, I don't want to get into too many details around the shape of revenue in the middle of a second quarter. But it is true that our second quarter was definitely better in the US in pharma and in other markets than in Q1. And so you know, we are hopeful and cautiously optimistic that there is a normalization pattern emerging. We're watching it very, very carefully.","And to the last part of your question, the US phenomenon and in terms of a market backdrop did affect all markets not just pharma.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Yeah, I know that's helpful, because I'm just trying to reconcile what you described in an encouraging way about your trends improving. But also the fact that you are highlighting the uncertainty related to Washington having an impact at the end of the quarter or are seemingly over the course of the quarter, maybe more so than maybe you would have expected coming out of Q1. So I'm not sure there is more to say there, but that's why I'm drilling in here.","Christopher O'Connell","I know that, and it's a good question and I think it's fair to say that this \u2013 there is a clearer picture as we said halfway through the year of that you know, broader governmental policy backdrop and the good news is that we have a lot of levers to pull to continue to deliver numbers. And even with relatively modest contribution from the US.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. One more quick one. Sherry, you bumped up EPF guidance by I think at $0.075 at the midpoint for the year. How much of this was the Q2 to be, how much of its FX. I guess I'm just looking for a bridge between old guidance and new guidance?. Thank you.","Sherry Buck","Yes. So it is about an 8% difference between our last guidance and I would characterize it at $0.08 FX and on the stock option capability we had in Q2 and then FX capability we're looking at.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open.","Paul Knight","Good morning. I know you guys have been doing a great job on the operating margin improvement, but you\u2019ve been really not manufacturing in the Chinese market, are you thinking about footprint or is there more margin according to how and where you manufacture I\u2019d love some color on that?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, Paul Yeah, I know we're very pleased with the P&L and think that the strong P&L that we showed for the quarter and for the year to date demonstrates you know, that consistency and resiliency of our model.","And you know, I'd further note that we're able to deliver that P&L, while you know, for the year-to-date, so far we're actually growing our R&D 9% on a constant currency basis. So we're investing for the future, while continuing to get the operating leverage through good efficiencies, operating wise and G&A.","In terms of the manufacturing base, as we've noted before Paul, we have a very balanced geographic footprint on manufacturing with our biggest centers in the United States, the UK, Ireland and Singapore. We do not have any manufacturing in China, but we certainly have a very global supply chain. And you know, continue to work that to gain ongoing efficiencies and continuous improvement in our costs.","Paul Knight","And could you talk to China a little bit more in depth. Like was that the manufacturing for biologics, was the government academic or industrial, what was - what was within those three areas stand out? Chris, thanks.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Yes, China was very balanced. In fact, you know, it's important to note about China, that China is probably a more balanced market than almost any of our major markets in terms of its contribution. Where our worldwide mix is maybe 60% pharma or just under 60% pharma, in China it's 10 points less than that. Furthermore, we've got our strongest concentration of our food testing business in China versus any major market.","If I look at the quarter the growth was very balanced. In fact, perhaps the highlight of the quarter in China was the industrial business. We had a huge comp in pharma for a year ago in China. And I don't want to quantify that too much, but we had good growth in pharma in China off an enormous comp. But really in the quarter the star of the quarter in China was our broad based industrial business.","Paul Knight","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citi. Your line is now open.","Dan Arias","Yes, hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks. Chris I just wanted to touch on the competitive dynamic inside TA if I could, just sort of curious about on the new end product introductions whether the team feels like it's taking part in a broader portfolio refresh across the industry or whether you're sort of more off cycle so to speak?","I don't mean if do you have a left field [ph] with a question here - I'm just - I'm trying to understand how much the new Discovery line-up is kind of poised to stand out in a market that's clearly improving?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah, it's a good question. I'd rather not comment on the competitive launches because I just don't have the insight as to how people stage those and so forth. What I can talk about is Discovery, which you know is a pretty significant leap forward in both performance, but also cost.","It's a wide ranging portfolio across different modalities of thermal analysis. And like any launch in the analytical instruments field it does take time to get traction. And so even though we had launched the DSE and the TGA last year, I think we're only beginning to find our sea legs [ph] in those products and still have additional modules to go.","And as we do that, we really define as we say winning the measurement in the field and are confident in products superiority. And furthermore with a platform that\u2019s been engineered with great attention to tiering, but also scaling technology and platforms, so that we can get profitability enhancements. And so our TA business with that additional growth is just a terrific profit generator for the corporation.","Dan Arias","Got it. Okay. And then maybe Sherry on the gross margin outlook, you noted the effect of currencies. I'm wondering if you can just touch on the impact that you think new products are having on the gross margins as those ramp? I think that was something that you touched on a little bit at the Analyst Day, just curious how you're thinking about that as an offset?","Sherry Buck","Yes. So as we look at our gross margins, you look at FX impact, as I mentioned in the quarter it was about 80 basis points. I would say, we're going to continue to see some impact of FX for the year as a headwind probably in the range of 80 to 100 basis points. And I'd say as far as new products when you look at our overall Water\u2019s results and the portfolio, I wouldn't say it was a big contributor to the gross margin.","Dan Arias","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Of course, you've talked about the government uncertainty here is being a bit of an overhang in the US, but you know, to Doug\u2019s question earlier, US pharma got a bit better, it seems like academics improving a bit.","So that overhang mainly on the industrial side and then as we think about you know where US is improving in the back half of the year. How much of that is more you know academic versus an industrial pickup?","Christopher O'Connell","Tycho, it\u2019s a important question and certainly the - you know I think our results at least looking at our different categories show that this overall backdrop and environment is affecting most businesses. My comment on better than Q1 reflected the US business overall, but specifically pharma, which was as you know not quite positive, but definitely better than Q1.","And so you know, I think what I look at is the underlying tone of demand in the market I talked to a lot of customers as you know and try to get into this dialogue and you know when I look at the combination of the demand which I still think is there, certainly in some cases global companies can move some of that demand to other parts of the world, which we do see a little bit of.","But you know, there is probably some holding back and the combination of that and in our order book gives me I'd say some cautious optimism that we should see a continuing pattern of improvement. And you know, hopefully in the back half of the year see US in positive territory.","Tycho Peterson","And can you touch on the demand in Europe, the results were solid there, can you just talk on where they are in terms of the replacement cycle versus maybe some of the US pharma counterparts?","Christopher O'Connell","You know, I don't want to - the question replacement cycle, as we talked about at our Investor Day you know, is you know, not really a major factor in the business. And it's not clear that there's any evidence that a replacement cycle demand affected demand in Europe in Japan or any of these markets, really owing to the very broad diversity of today's biopharmaceutical market.","So I think the trends we saw in Europe and Asia were evidence of you know, solid growth out of the developed markets and that growth does tend to move around a little bit between the US and Europe and Japan and I think that reflects the global nature of our business. We have plenty of examples where multinational companies ordered in the year - in Europe, but not in the US or ordered in Japan, but not the US.","And so you know the way I look at the business is more broadly at those developed markets. And if you look at trends for pharma in the developed markets they've been pretty steady quarter-to-date, year-to-date in that kind of low single digit way, while the emerging markets is a strong double-digit, solid double-digit type growth picture. You know, that's a slightly different way of cutting the business, but probably gives you a little more flavour as to know what the global picture looks like.","Tycho Peterson","And then just if I could ask one last one. You know, there's been a lot of changes on the CRO side in terms of consolidation in that space. Any change in demand from out of the CROs?","And then also you know, we've heard about a bit of a slowdown in \u2013 on the bio process side from third parties [ph] and others. Is that something you've seen from your biotech customers as well? Any change if events?","Christopher O'Connell","No, I I'd say it's probably too hard to piece out any particular CRO or CDMO trend. As you allude to there is clearly a robust contract business out there. It's one we're well aware of. We've been a leader in and continue to prioritize.","And yes, there is some consolidation, but really the underlying volumes in those type of operations continues to be you know, as they were and we don't see consolidation necessarily affecting that in the near term.","In terms of bio processing. You know, I would say that - I wouldn't accentuate any unusual trends in our bio area. Keep in mind, most of our business in biotech is in the development stage and you know, we're excited about that because that portends greater volumes, as some of that type of testing moves into the more routine operational workflows later in the cycle. So our perspective is probably a little more narrow there in the development phase.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Tim Evans","Thank you. So Chris, I hear you on the comp, on the pharma, but even on the stock comp basis it did decelerate off of Q1. And I think we're all trying to just get a sense for like what was driving that deceleration?","And then another way to think about it is just, you said that you felt comfortable that that was going to kind of maintain trend line. The trend line really in pharma has been high single digit. So what should we be thinking about in terms of growth for that market going forward?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Fair question. You're right, a recent trend line has been up in the high single digits, you know, in \u201816 pharma was 10. Like I said rolling 12 month pharma is 8. We did head into - we are heading into a period here of Q2 and even Q3 with very strong global pharma comps.","But when I say trend line Tim, recall I'm referring to more of the long-term trend line of the pharma market, which for us has been in that 6% range. And so as we talked about at the beginning of the year, as we look at the year we always you know, kind of revert back to our broad historical trend lines that maybe not the near-term trends, but the broad long-term trends.","And in pharma you know, that's more than that in that 6% range. Certainly as it relates to stacked comps. You know, in Q1 the last two Q1s the stack comp is 9, in the last two Q2s stat comp is 8. So that's been more of a near term phenomenon.","But you know, as you know, we don't always assume everything goes right and we forecast more of a long-term trend line for that and that I would say is where we're looking at it for the year we're in now.","Tim Evans","Okay. That's great. That's really where I wanted to get at. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan","Thanks. Good morning. Chris, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little on the comments related to the industrial demand, what you're seeing in order trends and what's embedded for growth in the end market through the end of the year?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. You know, just to, Jack to reiterate on the industrial side, we again had a really solid 7% quarter. Just to give you a sense on the broader picture, now year-to-date we're growing industrial at 8% and the 8% is also the growth of the industrial business for the last 12 months.","And so you know, recall we had come into the year after some lesser consistency we'll call it in the industrial markets in \u201815 and \u201816. You know, hopeful that some of the backdrop would improve. We have a very diversified industrial business as you know, between materials, characterization, food, fine chemicals, et cetera.","And so far the way the years played out is you know, we're very much benefiting from that - that industrial picture and that's a real positive for Waters. You know, again, as I've said a few times, one of the things that I really like about our model and the resiliency and consistency of our model is the fact that we have multiple levers to pull and you know, not every quarter plays out exactly like you think it's going to play out. But the fact that we're getting such good balance from our industrial end markets is a real positive for the company right now.","Jack Meehan","Great. And just to follow up maybe within Europe with the growth there you know, outside of the biopharma customer class you know, is there any commentary around Western versus Eastern Europe, any pickup in the Eastern side of the continent?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah, I mean, I would say the Europe business we're very pleased with in terms of its consistency and balance. And I would say to your question that we are seeing some encouraging signs in Eastern Europe, albeit Eastern Europe is much smaller than Western Europe. We definitely saw a nice pickup in the Eastern Europe business to create a picture in Europe that's pretty well balanced across most markets there.","Jack Meehan","Great. Thanks, Chris.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro","Good morning, guys. Thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of long-term questions, as it relates to where you\u2019re going to expand your end market opportunities. First off, I was just curious if you had an update on the Health Sciences initiative to extent that you can take some of your technology into more critical diagnostic settings, kind of curious how you're thinking about that?","And then secondly, on large molecule drug production to the extent that that\u2019s a growing part of the drug pipeline, I'm interested in your latest thoughts on how to monetize your technology for QA\/QC in those markets?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Thanks, Isaac. Appreciate the question. You know, as it relates Health Sciences and in particular clinical diagnostics because there is a couple of different pieces of what's been traditionally referred to as Health Science.","You know, I as you know in the strategic process tried to separate some of the more medical research applications around Olmecs [ph] and some of the really leading edge technology from the clinical diagnostics question which is a different one in a regulated market.","You know, those markets are smaller for us as we pointed out. You know, our top priorities are of course pharma materials and food. I think we continue to see intriguing long-term upside and another growth engine to light at some point. But we've not disproportionately shifted investment in that area. We think technology is going to take some time to evolve in those markets. And we're being patient with that I'd say.","We do have as you know, some very differentiated technology in that space around direct ionization mass spectrometry and we're very committed to leading the science in that area, at some point that could turn into a big business opportunity. But it's not in the near term, but that's how I'm thinking about it.","Meanwhile, we're beginning to build capability. We've made some strong hires in the area of quality and trying to make sure that we do all the right things in the near term to position for a longer term opportunity.","As it relates to the manufacturing in large molecule and really the production side, I guess what I\u2019d say Isaac there, our focus is really on you know, all phases about pharma. I think the opportunity we see to move routine mass spectrometry measurement into more routine workflows is a huge opportunity.","And that's why you've seen us really lead the market in technologies like the QDa and the Xevo TQ-S micro where we can you know, achieve a great balance of sensitivity size and value in reproducibility, so that companies can introduce SAs [ph] for multi attribute monitoring and more sophisticated measurement in routine operational workflows.","And I think that's really where our focus is. At the investor conference you heard us talk about the bio TARP [ph] program as an example of that, which is really our first signature move in our transformational engineering program, which is now backed up by really a bold organizational move to pull that off. So I think we're doing all the things we can do to make sure we're delivering technology to that segment over time.","Isaac Ro","Okay. Well, maybe to follow up you know, on both of those initiatives, as we think about like the long-term kind of cadence of news [ph] flow, is this something where we might expect a more meaningful update in 2018 or is it more of a three to five year things, just of kind of curious about how you're thinking about manifesting some of these opportunities with investors?","Christopher O'Connell","I'd say you know, starting where I ended the previous comment with, I think we hopefully were helpful to investors in talking about this vision for transformational engineering at our investor conference and backing that up with an example of a product system.","There's obviously more where that's coming from and those type of product milestones and system milestones coming out of that philosophy and that R&D strategy you know, will certainly be visible. You know as we roll into \u201818 and beyond.","In terms of meaningful changes or updates on the clinical diagnostics or as you call the Health Science side you know, I think that's an area that we'll just certainly share information when we have it. But just assume for the foreseeable future we're plugging away to service that business and trying to position for future opportunity without distracting from our number one priority, which is investing to grow in our core businesses.","Isaac Ro","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Isaac.","Operator","We still have a question here from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. This is Mike Circo [ph] on for Dan Leonard. Just had a quick question, I know you had said growth in India has been really strong and you expect it to continue. Are you seeing any effect even if it's a modest one from the implementation of the goods and service tax?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Mike. Thanks for dialling in. You talked about the GST tax?","Unidentified Analyst","Correct.","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. I mean, this is a \u2013 as you know, this is a harmonization of state and national transaction taxes into a national system long-term goal of creating a single market in India and to hopefully facilitate trade across their states. You know, we think in the long run it should be positive, in the short run there's not a material impact to Waters.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have a question here from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Luke Sergott","Hey, guys. This is Luke [Sergott ] on for us. Sorry about that. I had the mute button on. Can you just talk about how the underlying core business guide on profitability has changed from your prior forecasts and where the biggest swing factors for the second half aside from tax and FX?","Christopher O'Connell","The guide for the core business, I think Sherry, Luke had been pretty detailed in terms of how some of the numbers stack up, but let me just - I'll just offer a general comment on second half guide, which is you know, we're solid through the first half of course in that strong mid single digit range on revenue and that's the type of guide that we're expecting in the second half of the year, and again all this is on strong comps from a year ago.","So we're you know, really believe that we're tracking to another really solid year consistent with our historical pattern and a lot of the key drivers in the core businesses you ask are in place. The global pharma market, the Asia market, the recurring revenues and as number of people have asked with the added benefit of a really solid industrial business.","So as it relates to some of the questions people had on US, we've been relatively conservative on the US recovery. And so we're cautiously optimistic that we see some normalization not assuming any big bounce. And you know, we think that all adds up to a solid outlook with no material changes in margin assumptions. And you know, consistent modest leverage in the P&L outside of FX and tax.","So you know hopefully that summarizes the big picture. I'm not sure if you want to add anything to that.","Sherry Buck","No, I think Chris, that you\u2019ve covered it. I think our outlook for the year reinforces our overall model with strong mid single digits and double-digit earnings per share growth.","Luke Sergott","Okay.","Christopher O'Connell","Good, done. We have maybe one more or we all done with questions?","Operator","We show no questions in queue at this time. Again reminding\u2026","Christopher O'Connell","Great. Well, thank you all for your great questions. And just in conclusion, we are very pleased with our results through the first half of 2017, headlined by our ability to deliver strong organic top line growth, operating leverage and double-digit earnings per share growth. As we move into the back half of 2017, we remain focused on delivering results and feel that market conditions and our strong competitive position support continued success.","So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3, 2017 call, which we currently anticipate holding on October 24th 2017.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference call today. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Bryan Brokmeier, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Bryan Brokmeier","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results for the company for the third quarter and full year 2019.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 29, 2019.","During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning.","In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.","Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris O\u2019Connell, Waters' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Chris?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer.","During today's call, I will provide an overview of our second quarter operating results as well as some broader commentary on our business. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our third quarter and full year 2019 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.","Briefly reviewing our financial highlights for the second quarter, revenues grew 2% and adjusted earnings per share grew 10%. While sales in the quarter came in at the low end of our guidance range, we are encouraged by our progress in key areas of the business during the quarter, including achieving high-single digit growth in the U.S., growth in China and broad-based pharmaceutical strength across all major geographies.","With these positives and the stabilization in market trends that we saw during Q2 as well as the increasing impact of our new product launches, we are looking forward to continued improvement in the second half of 2019.","On our income statement, we demonstrated disciplined operating expense management during the quarter while protecting investment in key growth initiatives, particularly organic R&D. This operating control combined with our share repurchase program enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in Q2.","Before I review our end market, geographic and product line performance, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the three factors we cited in last quarter\u2019s call that led to a slower start to 2019 than we expected; China, Europe and TA Instruments.","First, on China. As a reminder, China represents 18% of our global revenue and has reliably delivered strong double-digit growth for an extended period of time. Our business mix in China is unique within our global portfolio as well as within the industry with more concentration in generic pharma and food testing.","In the second quarter, our business in China grew 3% overall. Our pharmaceutical business in China grew nicely in the quarter with growth in both large and small molecule applications. We continue to watch the 4+7 program closely, especially given the likely expansion of this pilot program later this year.","That said, some generic customers that have withheld purchasing in Q1 resumed their purchasing of instruments in Q2, particularly those that were awarded tenders as part of the 4+7 pilot program. And we have a strong market position with this customer base.","As we mentioned last quarter, we believe that over the long term, 4+7 will result in rising generic prescription volumes in China leading to attractive growth in demand for our instruments. On the large molecule side of the business in China, we continue to see solid growth affirming the ongoing strength of innovation in China and our strong market position.","We were also pleased to see our food business in China stabilize somewhat during the quarter, driven by stronger instrument demand from independent food labs. While this development is encouraging, it is not yet sufficient to offset the continued soft demand we are experiencing from the governmental food labs in China.","As we have discussed before, the food safety testing market in China is in transition which will lead to strong, long-term growth opportunities even if we experience some bumps during the process. Finally, in China, the progress we made in generic pharma and third party food testing was somewhat offset by weaker demand in academic and governmental markets.","Second, with respect to Europe, sales declined 2% during the quarter as modest growth in Western Europe was insufficient to offset a double-digit decline in Eastern Europe. Looking at Western Europe, we are encouraged by the solid pharmaceutical growth we experienced in Q2 as our large customers that had been more cautious in the first quarter increased their budget releases. However, that pharma growth was mostly offset by a decline in industrial and applied markets in Europe.","Third, our TA Instrument product line stabilized during the quarter with flat year-over-year revenue growth and all key product lines experiencing sequential improvement in year-over-year growth. Though we remain appropriately cautious given industrial market headwinds, particularly in Europe, we are confident that our strong global TA team, our leading market position and our robust product pipeline position us very well competitively through these market cycles.","Taking a closer look at the business, starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category increased 6% during the quarter with all major geographies growing. In China, we delivered solid growth in both small and large molecule applications.","Additionally, after a sluggish start to the year, our largest pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. and Europe began to release their 2019 budgets purchasing both LC and LC-MS instruments as well as our precision chemistries.","Year-to-date, overall sales to our pharmaceutical category grew 3% including double-digit growth in large molecule pharma. We remain excited about our market position and expanding product portfolio in large molecule pharma where we have seen consistent double-digit growth.","Sales to our worldwide industrial category, which include material science, food and environmental markets, declined 3% in the quarter due to weakness in industrial, chemicals and materials and soft demand in food testing markets, particularly in Europe.","Year-to-date, our worldwide industrial category sales were down 3%. We remain confident in our portfolio of growth opportunities in the industrial markets, particularly with our newly launched Tandem Quad Mass Spec products and strong TA product line.","Sales to our academic and governmental category were flat in Q2 as strong growth in biomedical research applications in the U.S., Europe and Korea were offset by softness in China. Year-to-date, our governmental and academic category was up 2%.","In general, we are seeing stable government funding patterns in most markets with the current exception of China. For the second half of the year, we are looking forward to the benefits of the recently launched Cyclic IMS and SYNAPT XS high resolution mass spec systems to serve the strong demand in biomedical research applications.","Next, I will review our sales performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest region in terms of revenue, grew 3% in the second quarter. As I noted earlier, China\u2019s 3% growth performance was driven by solid pharmaceutical growth partially offset by weaker demand in academic and governmental markets.","In India, demand continued to stabilize with the completion of national elections and we anticipate solid growth in the back half of the year. Elsewhere in Asia Pacific, we were particularly pleased with our business in Japan and Korea where we expect continued stable trends.","Turning to the U.S., we are very pleased by our 8% growth in the second quarter. U.S. pharma grew mid-single digits as our largest pharmaceutical customers increased spending across both LC and LC-MS instruments.","U.S. pharma was led by strong growth in large molecule applications although it\u2019s important to note that small molecule pharma returned to growth in the quarter driven by a healthier generic environment. Overall, the Americas grew 5% in the second quarter as declines in Latin America resulting from political instability in Mexico and Brazil partially offset our strong U.S. growth.","In Western Europe, as noted before, sales growth was positive in the quarter behind strong pharmaceutical growth mostly offset by broad industrial weakness. Eastern Europe declined double digits leading to an overall decline of Europe sales of 2%. Eastern Europe was affected by very difficult comps and we expect growth will normalize over the course of the year.","Finally, I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instrument sales stabilized in the quarter and increased 1% as strong instrument sales to pharmaceutical customers were mostly offset by general industrial softness as noted before.","LC instruments grew modestly driven by demand in large molecule pharma, partially offset by soft industrial markets. In mass spectrometry, our Q2 business grew modestly driven by strong pharmaceutical demand particularly for the QDa and high resolution mass spec systems.","In particular, our QTof mass spec portfolio sold well in the quarter setting the stage for even better high resolution mass spec sales in the second half when we expect to begin shipping our Cyclic IMS and SYNAPT XS systems and also see increasing contribution of BioAccord.","Waters branded recurring revenues, which reflect the combination of service and precision chemistries, grew 4% during the quarter. Pharmaceutical strength in chemistry was partially offset by softness in our academic and governmental category.","In particular, growth was strong within our application kits, UPLC columns and bioseparation columns including our recently launched BioResolve Reversed Phase Monoclonal Antibody columns.","I provided some color on TA earlier in the call, but to quickly recap, sales were flat in the second quarter with TA instrument sales down 2% and service sales up 5%. We are encouraged that our thermal, rheology and microcalorimetry product lines improved their growth rates sequentially.","Returning to the big picture, we remain steadfastly focused on executing on our five-point value-creating model. As we have consistently communicated, we aim to create shareholder value by first, holding a leading specialty position in structurally attractive markets; two, executing a focused growth strategy driven by organic innovation.","Three, seeking opportunities to continuous operational improvement in innovation, channel and our operations; four, maintaining capital discipline as we shift from being a capital accumulator to a capital deployer; and five, operating with a performance-oriented culture and management team.","We are truly excited about our significant new product cycle which is the result of our purposeful increases in R&D spending over the past three years. Halfway through the year, we have introduced a meaningful number of new products across a range of technology, market and application categories.","While we\u2019ve launched a number of critical new platform extensions and product enhancements in LC and TA, I\u2019d like to focus my comments here on several of our exciting new mass spec system launches.","In Q1, we launched a groundbreaking BioAccord system, a fit-for-purpose, a high-performance LC-MS system for routine monitoring of biomolecule attributes in regulated laboratories. Customer feedback has been very positive and we are seeing an expanding pipeline of leads, opportunities and quotes which position us for a meaningful ramp over the next several years.","At ASMS in June, we launched two new high resolution mass spec systems. The first, the Select Series Cyclic IMS is a revolutionary next generation mass spectrometry instrument designed in collaboration with leading researchers with the aim of advancing their cutting-edge research.","It combines novel cyclic IM mobility separation with variable higher performance time-of-flight mass spectrometry to enable previously unattainable ion selection in fragmentation for advanced mass spec users across a very broad range of molecules.","The second high resolution mass spectrometer we launched at ASMS was the SYNAPT XS, a new high resolution instrument for research scientists with unprecedented flexibility of inlets and acquisition modes.","The system incorporates the StepWave XS ion guide from the Cyclic IMS providing the first example of Waters\u2019 transferring leading-edge technology from our advanced mass spec program into the broader mass spec portfolio. Customer interest in both systems has been very high and we\u2019ve already received multiple orders for both the Cyclic IMS and SYNAPT XS.","Most recently, we were pleased yesterday to announce the launch of two new mid-ranged Tandem Quad mass spec systems. First is the Xevo TQ-S cronos, a new tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer that is purpose-built for routine quantitation of large numbers of small-molecule organic compounds over a wide concentration range.","The TQ-S cronos system is paired with a next generation version of the popular Xevo TQ-S micro bolstering our Tandem Quad line of mass spectrometers that is perfectly suited for the applied markets, including pesticide residue analysis, contaminants monitoring in processed foods, identifying drugs of abuse and performing impurity profiling of pharmaceuticals.","To recap where we stand midway through 2019, while we started the year facing a number of unanticipated headwinds, particularly in China and Europe, we have focused on managing through these challenges to sequentially improve our growth.","During Q2, key areas of our business improved, including achieving high-single digit growth in the U.S., growth in China and pharmaceutical strength across all major geographies. This progress is encouraging.","Stabilizing end markets as well as our accelerating cadence of new product introductions provide us with the confidence that we will be able to achieve continued improvement over the course of the year.","With that, I\u2019d like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of the second quarter financials. Sherry?","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we recorded net sales of $599 million, an increase of approximately 2% in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 2% resulting in flat sales as reported. In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical market grew 6%. Sales into our industrial market declined 3%, while academic and governmental markets were flat.","Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistries products and service revenue, grew 4% in the quarter, while instrument sales were flat. As we noted last quarter, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters, but there is one additional calendar day in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2018.","Breaking second quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services grew 3%, while sales of TA-branded products and services were flat. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument platform sales were up 1% and TA's instrumentation system sales decreased by 2%.","Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 3% with China growing at 3%. Sales in the Americas were up 5% driven by 8% growth in U.S. and European sales were down 2%.","Now, I\u2019d like to comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.4% compared to 59.2% in the second quarter of 2018. The lower gross margin relative to the prior-year quarter was primarily the result of FX.","Moving down the second quarter P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 1% on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation decreased operating expense growth by approximately 3% on a reported basis.","In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was about 16%. Year-to-date, the tax rate is approximately 14%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net interest expense was $6 million, an increase of about 3 million from the prior year as anticipated as we shifted to a net debt position during the quarter.","Our average share count came in at 69.5 million shares, a share count reduction of approximately 11% or about 9 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased to $2.14 in comparison to $1.95 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.08 compared to $1.98 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning.","Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our second quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items.","In the second quarter of 2019, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $20 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow were $29 million for U.S. tax reform-related payments and $20 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the second quarter, this resulted in $0.23 of each dollar sales converted into free cash flow and $0.26 year-to-date.","Now, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our second quarter activities related to capital deployment, which we categorize into three areas; investing for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility, and the return of capital to shareholders.","During the quarter, R&D grew 6% on a constant currency basis as we continue to invest in bringing innovative new products to market. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $577 million in the second quarter.","These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow, resulted in cash and short-term investments of $676 million and debt of $1.1 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, resulting in a shift to a net debt position of $473 million.","Looking ahead, we remain committed to deploying capital against these three priorities and continue working towards a near-term capital structure of up to 2.5x net debt to EBITDA ratio.","Our current plans are to repurchase approximately $600 million in shares during the third quarter and consistent with our previous communications, about $2.5 billion for the full year. These assumptions are reflected in our 2019 guidance. We will continue to evaluate our share repurchase plans over the remainder of the year and provide quarterly updates.","Turning to working capital. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 79 days this quarter, up slightly compared to the second quarter of last year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $52 million in comparison to the prior-year quarter, driven by planned inventory build related to Brexit contingency planning, quarterly sales volumes and inventory build for new product launches.","As we look forward to the balance of the year, I\u2019d like to comment on our full year 2019 guidance. As Chris previously mentioned, we continue to expect improved second half revenue performance versus the first half.","That said, when factoring in our actual results for the first half, we are updating our full year 2019 constant currency sales growth guidance to a range of 1% to 3% from our prior guidance range of 2% to 4% constant currency sales growth. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to decrease 2019 sales growth by 1 to 2 percentage point.","Net interest expense guidance for the full year is now expected to be in a range of $30 million to $32 million which is lower than our prior guidance of $30 million to $35 million. ","Our other key assumptions for the full year guidance are unchanged. Gross margin of 58.5% to 59%, operating expense growth at a rate that is below our sales growth rate, full year effective tax rate of 14% to 15% and lastly an average diluted share count of 68.5 million to 69 million shares outstanding.","Rolling all of this together, and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2019 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $8.95 to $9.10, a decrease from our prior range of $9.05 to $9.25. At current rates, the negative currency impact on full year earnings per share growth is expected to be 2 to 3 percentage points.","Looking at the third quarter of 2019, we expect 2% to 4% constant currency sales growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to decrease third quarter sales growth by approximately 1 percentage point.","Combining these top line factors with a moderate increase in expenses, we estimate third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share in the range of $2.05 to $2.15. At current rates, the negative currency impact on third quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be 2 to 3 percentage points.","Chris will now make a few summary comments. Chris?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Great. Thank you, Sherry. In summary, while our first half of 2019 was slower than we expected, we did see improvement in the second quarter, particularly in key growth drivers of our business, namely our two largest geographies; U.S. and China, and in our largest market category, pharmaceuticals.","In total, we expect a better second half than our first half based on the improving end market conditions we saw in the second quarter as well as our accelerating cadence of new product introductions.","With that, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not always able to get to everyone's questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Waters Investor Relations team after the call. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik De Bruin","Hi. Good morning.","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Good morning, Derik.","Derik De Bruin","Hi. Can you just clarify on the margins for a little bit? How did FX help? I know the pound obviously has been tanking. So how does that flow through? I know that benefits you. Can you just talk about the impact on the margin?","Sherry Buck","Yes. Hi, Derik. This is Sherry. In the quarter, our FX on the top line kind of came in as expected and on gross margin it was unfavorable, about 60 basis points \u2013 impacted about 60 basis points. And then we \u2013 as it flowed through to EPS, it was a little bit more unfavorable than what we had expected. And basically it\u2019s due to the weaker euro and the pound and yen movement wasn\u2019t able to be offset.","Derik De Bruin","Got it. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of questions on China and one of your competitors in the tool space flagged some incremental headwinds in that market yesterday with some government tender commentary there. Can you just talk about a little bit more about the situation there and what you\u2019re seeing in 4+7? And also just anything in terms of unusual activity from either a pricing perspective or potentially orders going to more local vendors there? Thanks.","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Sure, Derik. Let me jump into that and start with the 4+7 as you began. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see really a loosening of some of the spending that had been so constricted in the first quarter, particularly in the month of March. And as I mentioned, we saw some of the winners come forward with instrument purchasing from the first round. And just as a reminder, Phase 1 of the 4+7 involved a target of 31 drugs, 25 were actually completed through the tendering process. And now we do have some expectation as Phase 2 is upon us. I think there is still some lack of clarity in the market as it relates to how it all plays out, but I would characterize the tone of our customers as being a little bit more balanced than we saw them in Q1. Q1, the news was so new, the process was so new that it really had a freeze effect in the market and we did see some chilling of that freeze and some better underlying demand. As I mentioned many times, we see the overall objectives of the 4+7 program being positive for the consumer in China and ultimately for instrument purchases. And so we\u2019re just managing our way through it. ","As it relates to the rest of the market in China, we didn\u2019t see any unusual activity to your question on pricing or any local bias. As you know, a lot of our business in China is in highly regulated categories and therefore there is less of a local competition dynamic than perhaps other companies. But China obviously is a dynamic market right now. We\u2019re just staying very, very focused on what we do well there which is to serve our customers and deliver technology to them. And our overall expectations for China over the rest of the year are what I\u2019d say cautious and balanced where we\u2019re seeing some great strength in areas like large molecule, biomedical research, clinical diagnostics with ongoing questions on 4+7, so we\u2019re in a little bit of a wait and see mode there. Our exposure in government food labs has been under pressure while we also see some good development on the independent side. So, overall, kind of a balanced view but certainly not any expectations that China comes all the way back to historical levels. We see more of a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hi. Good morning. Chris, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk on the pharma recovery. Last quarter, you talked about some delays on the budget release. How much of this quarter was just catch up versus what could be a sustainable recovery from pharma?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Sure. Thanks. Good morning, Tycho. Yes, we did see \u2013 we definitely saw better pharma tone really across the portfolio in Q2 and that had been a welcome sign after Q1. I don\u2019t know that I would characterize it as a catch up from Q1 per se, but just an overall health and strength of the pharmaceutical market. As I mentioned, we grew in all key geographies. We continue to see robust large molecule trends. And despite some of the hits on the small molecule side we\u2019ve taken in recent years in India and China, we do believe in the ongoing health of that market driven by expanding patient access to therapies. I guess one other comment there is in particular what we call our top pharma, which is our top 15 pharma accounts, we are very encouraged by them. They had a better quarter in Q2 than we\u2019ve seen in a while. And while we\u2019re not assuming any unusual flush activities in the back half of the year, we expect what I\u2019d characterize as normal second half improvement in a pattern that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. So it was nice to have pharma overall for us at the historical growth rates in that 6% growth range and as long as that continues on that pattern, which we do expect, we gain confidence in our numbers in the back half of the year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then for the follow up, can you just address the guidance reduction? It sounds like pharma is stabilizing a bit. China is maybe going to be consistent with what you saw in 2Q. So it is really just the industrial outlook that you\u2019re factoring in the back half of the year for the guidance reduction?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Yes, I\u2019ll make a quick comment and let Sherry go a little deeper on the guide. Obviously, halfway through the year it\u2019s just math on the first half. And so you take the actual for the first half and then you take our outlook for the second half which we\u2019ve tried to be clear we do expect to be better than the first half and have some of these market trends continue plus the incremental benefit of our new products. And so what ends up in forming the overall range for the year is simply the first half actuals, because we came in a little bit in the lower end of our range in Q2 that had the effect of taking down the first half actual a little bit. But looking at the second half, I think you\u2019ve characterized it correctly which is we expect a solid and healthy pharma, solid and healthy U.S. environment that was a real nice part of the quarter with a balanced view in China and I\u2019d say probably more caution on the European environment overall.","Sherry Buck","And just adding to that a little bit, when you think about the markets, Chris had talked about pharma, also probably a little bit cautious on the industrial given what we\u2019ve seen so far in the year. When you look at our EPS guide range, we lowered it from the midpoint. There\u2019s really two factors that drove that. One would be our FX guidance update. That\u2019s about half of the change, 1 point we\u2019re seeing as FX, and then the volume changing kind of our midpoint growth volume for the full year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Thanks, Tycho.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","Good morning, guys. So I appreciate some of the color on the cyclical end markets and some of the industrial noise. I guess as you\u2019re thinking about second half, the CapEx line in general in terms of instruments has been sort of a source of weakness now for I don\u2019t know, maybe 12, 18 months. I think probably the weakest periods were instruments since maybe '08, '09. Obviously, you\u2019ve got a lot of new products coming in that you can control. But on the stuff you can\u2019t, I guess how are you thinking about the degree of risk from just general macro slowdown, so PMIs continue to decelerate, some of the challenges in China, we know of Europe obviously the threat of hard Brexit there that\u2019s tough to figure out but it seems like a risk? And then layering in what we know about 4+7, obviously we were there in China not long ago. It seems certainly like there was going to be an expansion. And so, again, that\u2019s something not in your control and may end up positive but still causes some lack of visibility. So I guess how are you thinking about the cadence of the product rollouts, what you can control versus the risk of what you can\u2019t control, because it seems like the key to getting Waters back to its more normalized growth rate is obviously going to be getting that CapEx line back to a more \u2013 the instrument line back to a more normal level. Like, how do you put that whole pie together as you think about getting back to, I don\u2019t know, 3%, 4%, 5% instrument growth by next year which you need to kind of get back to your long-term growth rates?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Yes, thank you, Ross, and good morning. And that\u2019s exactly the goal here is to get that instrument line moving and you correctly pointed out that there is a lot in the new cadence that we do control, and we\u2019re really excited about that. Like I said on the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve invested assertively. We\u2019ve really put our heads down to improve our overall product portfolio and we\u2019re really I think going to be able to see the positive benefits of that and it\u2019s certainly been something that\u2019s energized our customers and our field organization as we look into the back half of the year. And so we definitely try to focus on what we can control there. In terms of a lot of the macro pieces that you identified, we\u2019ve tried to put together a guide that really bakes in a lot of that question, if you will, and there are different points that you mentioned. The general industrial slowdown is certainly something that\u2019s affected our business and that\u2019s primarily a European question as our industrial business in the U.S. was actually quite positive in the quarter and has been positive. The European environment is really characterized by a lot of uncertainty particularly as you point out around Brexit. There\u2019s no question that the northern part of Europe has in particular been impacted by that. We\u2019ve seen more pressure in the northern part of Europe than we have in the southern part of Europe, but obviously that\u2019s going to work its way towards a resolution point one way or another here by the end of the year. And of course, in China, it\u2019s a variety of factors there and most prominent to us has been 4+7 in the food question. But like I mentioned earlier, I think there\u2019s a little more moderation around 4+7 expectations as participants in the market come to grips with the new process but also see the growth that\u2019s inherent in this marketplace. We don\u2019t know exactly what Phase 2 is going to look like there. We do understand that unlike Phase 1, there may be multiple winners per tender accepted which could moderate the dynamic overall. So some uncertainty but we believe all those factors are baked into our near-term guide here.","Ross Muken","Chris, maybe on a strategic level, one of the things that sort of differentiated growth this quarter and last quarter or sometimes when the group is kind of exposure to bio production, you guys have some presence there but certainly not the same scale you do in small molecule. I guess as you think about strategically how you\u2019ve deployed your capital, with some of the bumps you\u2019ve had, the stock has hung in there given all the buyback that\u2019s happened. I guess has there been any thought maybe to getting a little bit more aggressive on the sort of strategic tuck-in M&A side to maybe get the bias particularly on pharma where you\u2019ve got some a dominant presence a little bit more skewed towards the biotech side versus maybe where you are today?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Yes. I think that\u2019s an important topic and as you know from our capital allocation priorities which we have really refined since U.S. tax reform which was a real game changer for us, we do have as our first priority for capital deployment growing the business and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve allocated more capital to internal R&D. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve allocated more capital to CapEx. And we\u2019ve over the past several years built a corporate development function within the company to be more active outside the company looking for opportunities to deploy capital to highly purposeful selective M&A. And so we are definitely more active on that front, but with a high degree of both strategic and financial discipline. In the overall bio production world there\u2019s obviously a lot of analytical technologies in that space where we\u2019ve been forward leaning for some time. We\u2019ve had some market leading technology in areas like process analytical and other related areas in terms of more participation in some of those spaces. Some of that would be logical. We\u2019re always going to stay within a framework of our specialty focus as a company, but we do see that to provide incremental growth opportunity. And obviously a lot of specifics we can put around that until you see us more active.","Ross Muken","Okay. Thanks, Chris.","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good morning. Chris, I want to come back to the China generics market in 2Q specifically. Are you seeing sequential growth in that part of the business? Was it ahead of plan? And kind of what are you embedding for the second half outlook? And sort of do you feel like kind of the worst is behind you there at this point?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Yes, I think I\u2019d probably stop short of saying the worst is behind us. I think it\u2019s just generally a cautious environment. But we definitely saw better dynamic in Q2 than Q1. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw growth in both small and large molecule applications within China. In the case of large mol, that\u2019s been a consistent trend for some time reflecting the underlying innovation that\u2019s going on in the biomolecule space. And in small molecule we\u2019re weighted towards generics there and we did see some of our customers kind of perk up during the quarter. And those that are feeling confident in these bidding processes are looking to spend their capital budgets over the course of the year. So, yes, we did see sequential improvement on the generics side. But until we gain more clarity on how everything plays out, we\u2019re making sure we had relatively moderate type expectations.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. I\u2019d love to get your perspective on how you think the order book is kind of building for some of the newer products, like BioAccord, Cyclic and the new SYNAPT system, how the order funnels are building the areas of most interest and what you think the impact might be to instrument revenues from some of those new systems in the back half?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Yes, we\u2019re definitely focused a lot on that. And I\u2019d also want to mention the two new tandem quad launches that we announced yesterday, which really delighted our field organization to improve our core kind of midrange tandem quad line with Xevo TQ-S cronos and the Xevo TQ-S micro refresh. So when we look at that, we do have an expectation for improving mass spec performance in the back half of the year. In terms of the order book activities, since ASMS we\u2019ve been out with the high end, high resolution systems and as I mentioned we\u2019ve received some orders already for both Cyclic as well as SYNAPT XS even though those are back half launches, if you will. And BioAccord because it\u2019s really a new to market technology targeting an emerging space, it\u2019s more of a market development activity and we\u2019ve been really focused on a tremendous amount of demonstration type activity working with customers to evolve their own \u2013 support their own budgetary processes to free up money within the year and to develop that overall lead opportunity and quoting pipeline. And we monitor and manage those statistics rigorously and are pleased with that, and so we do expect to see a more visible impact on BioAccord in the back half of the year and really something that as I said in the prepared remarks is really a multiyear phenomenon. So, again, I don\u2019t want to put specific numbers on any one of those categories or the portfolio overall other than to say in our efforts to really get the instrument line moving, these product launches are critical and we\u2019re excited about them.","Brandon Couillard","Super. Thanks.","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","All right. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I want to start by talking about chemistry and then I want to come back and talk about the revised growth outlook for the year. So starting on chemistry, just to unpack results in the second quarter and the outlook from here, you\u2019ve generated better than corporate average growth this quarter. But the last couple of quarters have been a bit below historical trend. You\u2019ve called out timing headwinds in the first quarter that were supposed to benefit Q2. Did these tailwinds materialize in the quarter? And can you comment generally on recurring revenue growth? Is the slight deceleration in the first half just due to weaker installed base growth over the past few quarters? And if so, is the expectation that over time as instrument placements improve that chemistry and broader recurring will improve?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Yes, thanks, Doug, and good morning. On the chemistry line and unpacking that a little bit, there was in our portfolio strength on the chemistry side in the biopharm area and pharmaceuticals evolved really at historic-type level with some softness on the industrial side given the overall end market dynamics there. Chemistry sales in part move with installed base and in part move with overall volume of testing activity. And so the extent a segment like industrial is a little bit soft, you\u2019re going to see some effect to that on chemistries. And so really what I\u2019d say is a little bit of a tale of two cities on positive chemistry results on the pharma side and slightly below normal on the industrial side. In terms of the overall recurring revenues as well as service, we continue to sell a wide range of service programs into the market and to some degree it does reflect underlying instrument activity. But sometimes we also see dynamics in certain product lines where there\u2019s been slower instrument growth take on a little bit more of a service burden and so we get some benefit from that. So overall, we expect to see continued solid recurring revenue growth over the course of the rest of the year. And certainly as instrument growth picks up with our new product cycle, we think there\u2019s opportunity in both those lines.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you for that, Chris. And on the growth outlook, just to go back to this at least one more time. It seems like the key driver to the full year of growth guidance reduction and I think your words were first half results coming up a little bit light and then a change in the industrial outlook. If I\u2019m doing the math right, it seems like it has to be largely the latter because mathematically if we adjust for how Q2 came together, it still seems like you\u2019re essentially cutting the second half growth expectations by almost 100 basis points. So with that in mind, I would have thought your expectations on industrial were already pretty muted at this point. So could you first quantify exactly what the changes in industrial expectations, confirm that there isn\u2019t another dynamic here because mathematically it suggest something else is possibly going on here? And I guess lastly, TA was flat year-over-year against a really tough comp overall in instruments. I\u2019m just wondering if you still expect TA to grow at least low single digits in the second half of the year or even coming off of a tough comp and a strong quarter, relatively speaking is this a bit optimistic given your comments on industrial in Europe? Thank you.","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Thanks, Doug. I guess the way I would describe maybe the difference between what we expected and what we saw in Q2, which plays through to the rest of the year, certainly we were very pleased with the U.S., we\u2019re very pleased with pharma, we were pleased to see China come back a bit. Really Europe was probably the main swing factor there that probably put us in the lower part of the range versus the middle or upper part of the range and Europe, as I mentioned, is primarily an industrial headwind there because we did see better pharmaceutical performance in Europe in the quarter. And so I think it\u2019s fair to say that if there\u2019s any kind of conservatism built into our overall second half outlook, it\u2019s really around the challenging European environment, particularly in the industrial category. That\u2019s really where we saw the difference in terms of our own expectations in the quarter and obviously play that through for the rest of the year. But that being said, we\u2019re really looking to pharma on the U.S. to lead the way and a more balanced outlook on China. To answer your TA question, you\u2019re right. TA kind of came back from negative to flat on tough comps and we do expect some modest continuing progress on the TA side and certainly something in the low-single digits for the second half is what we\u2019re looking at. TA product line is great. The team is very focused doing a good job. And yes, some of those markets are challenging but there\u2019s also some bright spots within the TA portfolio. The U.S. was actually quite strong in TA. And decent in China, in Japan with pressure in Europe and some other parts of Asia. And interestingly enough, we do sell some products in TA into the pharma sector, particularly in the microcalorimetry line for sort of biomolecule characterization and that pharma business for TA is doing really well. Anyway, maybe I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan of UBS. Your line is open.","Daniel Brennan","Great. Thanks for the questions. Chris, not to belabor, but I was hoping to go back to China one more time, if you don\u2019t mind. Could you just flush out and just remind us specifically how large is your China generics and China food business, specifically what did they grow in the quarter, if you could share that? And then, well, I can appreciate the visibility is limited given the government hasn\u2019t really enacted the next step on the generics presumably. You\u2019re in a better position than we are to kind of assess kind of what\u2019s a reasonable kind of rate of outlook for growth for your businesses and I think it\u2019s important for us to get some sense on what the potential parameters around that business growing going forward as these programs rollout. So if you can help us with that that would be terrific?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Sure. Let me see if I can add some incremental thoughts there, Dan. Thank you. As it relates to kind of mix where you started on generics and food, just some broad parameters. Small mol versus last mol in China last year was in the sort of 80-20 range; 80 small, 20 large. And if you look at our overall mix of generics, it\u2019s higher in China than it is around the world. Globally, generics is maybe 30% of pharma and you can call it a little bit more than that in China, so China is more weighted there. On the food side, food testing not including environment, it\u2019s about 15% of our China business which again is a little bit over indexed compared to the overall global mix. And we still see in the backdrop of China a robust pharma environment. Clearly 4+7 was a shock to the system in the first quarter. And like I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve gained some incremental insights just on what happened in that first wave around the 25 drugs that actually went through versus the 31 targeted with Phase 2 and coming probably in the fall timeframe, but maybe a different dynamic as the market broadens to multiple winners. We also know that expectations on hospitals and other purchasers of these drugs is for a majority of the listed drugs to come from winning bidders, but not all of them. So there is some belief in the marketplace that there\u2019s still room for a number of players. And as this program expands over the next two to three years that there will be room to play for a variety of different types of companies, and because of that we did see some back-to-business attitude in the part of our customers. Because there is some continued uncertainty there, we haven\u2019t assumed a spring back to what I call a normal pharma purchasing environment this year, but hopefully we\u2019ll gain continued visibility of that over the course of the year. So I think our outlook in China of kind of that balanced and somewhat cautious view is appropriate and continuing to look at the type of trends that we saw in the second quarter.","Daniel Brennan","Great. Thanks, Chris, for that. And then just back to the small mol with U.S. and Europe, so can you just give us some flavor specifically like how your businesses did for pharma in U.S. and Europe? I think you might have said that already, but maybe just clarify that? And then secondly is whatever concerns that were there on the first quarter for this small mol-related spending slowdown, are those removed and it was just normal budget timing or are there any lingering issues to point to related to small molecule? Thank you.","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Yes. Thanks, Dan. As I mentioned, we did see better tone in the market in small mol in Q2 than Q1. In Q1 we\u2019ve seen this pattern in previous years which is kind of a wait and see caution kind of attitude in the earlier parts of the year, particularly among our larger customers. But like I said, we saw our larger customers really come back and actually have about as good of a quarter as they\u2019ve had in a while. In terms of the European and the U.S. kind of overall pharma growth in the quarter, it was in that solid mid-single digit range. And so we were encouraged by that. And like I said earlier encouraged at our overall pharma business was operating in the quarter at historical kind of rolling trend rates. And so we think that stability is something we expect for the second half of the year.","Daniel Brennan","Great. Thank you, Chris.","Bryan Brokmeier","We have time for about one more question, operator.","Operator","And that question comes from Sung Ji Nam of BTIG. Your line is open.","Sung Ji Nam","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of quick ones, one on China again. For the academic, government segment there, some of your peers are seeing some strong growth. And so curious as to \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to reconcile what maybe your product mix there? Is it largely food testing environmental versus biomedical research, if you could provide some color on that?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Sure, no problem. Thanks, Sung Ji. In China, there\u2019s a pretty wide range of activity in government and academic categories and so mix really matters there. When you look at our academic and government sector, we have a really strong concentration in the food safety testing which as we\u2019ve commented for a few quarters now has been very, very soft. We made up for that a little bit through the independent testing labs, but the government and academic part of that has been overall weak. And there is a lot of reorganization going on in the government right now that has worked its way through the national level and now working into the provisional and city level. And so we are cautious about the overall government market and the academic market which is sometimes related to that. So, it can be pretty lumpy as well though. So I think we\u2019re not drawing any real conclusions based on what we\u2019ve seen this year so far, particularly with our mix and other parts of government and academic beside food. But at this point it\u2019s something that held us back in the quarter.","Sung Ji Nam","Great. And then just \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019re seeing some decent momentum for the newly launched products this year. Wondering if I might be able to extract some more color based on kind of the quoting activity, the early market development activities as well as customer feedback in terms of how the order growth is kind of trending? Is it pretty much in line with your expectations ahead of launch or I\u2019m just trying to figure out \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too early to tell, but maybe is there some better than expected outlook for some of the newly launched products?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","It\u2019s a good question. You never know the exact timing of how the order book builds per se, but all the leading indicators for that are something we\u2019re putting quite a bit of effort into understanding in more detail. We\u2019ve build a sales operations function that is more closely linking the commercialization activities to all the different activities in the field and giving us the data points we need to gain comfort that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. But it starts all the way back with customer introduction with the demoing process for which we\u2019re doing some new things this year, and then translating into an overall lead and opportunity which is a highly qualified lead book and then into quoting activity and all those trends seem to be moving in the right direction. We\u2019re thrilled that we have some orders already for the SYNAPT and the Cyclic systems, the BioAccord pipeline is strong and to throw on top of that yesterday we launched the new tandem quad which is exciting for our field organization. Anyway I don\u2019t want to put too much specificity on forecasting orders or sales other than to say the overall portfolio effect is something that we really believe is going to help us in the back half of the year. So it\u2019s really an outcome of all the good work we\u2019ve been doing in R&D.","So, anyway I know we\u2019re out of time and sorry we couldn\u2019t get to more questions, but really enjoyed the questions and look forward to further discussions with all of you.","In conclusion, we are focused on delivering a stronger second half of 2019 headlined by continued pharmaceutical strength, improving stability in key geographic markets and the increasing impact of our exciting new product cycle.","Furthermore, we remain confident in the long-term health of our end markets, our very strong competitive position within our priority categories, our focused growth strategies and our talented people around the world.","So on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3 2019 call, which we currently anticipate holding on October 29, 2019.","Thanks and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Bryan Brokmeier, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Bryan Brokmeier","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full year 2018. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for July 24, 2018.","During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financials included in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges, given on today's call are given on a comparable constant-currency basis.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Chris O'Connell","Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer. During today's call I will provide an overview of our Q1 operating results as well as some broader commentary on our business. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and provide an update on our Q2 and full year 2018 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.","Briefly reviewing our financial highlights for the first quarter revenues grew 2% and adjusted earnings per share grew 9%. We were disappointed with our first quarter revenue results which were weaker than we had expected due to two main factors, under performance within our mass spectrometry product line and a very soft market in India as we close the quarter. The weak performance of the mass spec product line was attributable to an unusually sluggish start in biomedical research, particularly high resolution mass spec in the OMEX area. Combined with temporary disruption from territory realignment within our U.S. mass spec sales team made as part of an ongoing growth initiative.","As a reminder our sales of high end mass spec products in the biomedical research market is a small part of our business and prone to variability quarter-to-quarter. Furthermore, the sales force realignment is now complete, new positions have been filled by high quality professionals and we have begun to establish a strong order pipeline giving us confidence in a mass spec reacceleration.","In India, our customers delayed purchases in Q1 as they focused on protecting their balance sheets and P&Ls in their final fiscal quarter of what turned out to be a difficult year for them, particularly caused by the GST implementation. As a reminder the vast majority of Indian multinationals complete their fiscal years in March. Based on order visibility and the overall positive tone of our Indian pharmaceutical customers, we anticipate that India will improve in the current quarter and normalize in the second half of 2018.","On the positive side, sales to our pharmaceutical customers outside of India saw continued strength. As did sales of our TA product line and China had a solid start. Furthermore, we ended the quarter with a strong pipeline and remain confident in our business outlook. I'll provide more color on that in a moment.","Looking briefly in the P&L, we were pleased with the solid earnings results despite the weaker than expected top line growth. While investing in growth through organic innovation we demonstrated disciplined operating expense control that drove margin expansion and enabled us to exceed our planned earnings per share.","Now taking a closer look at the business starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 3% in the quarter. Excluding India, sales to the pharmaceutical market were up 6% with double digit growth in China and mid-single-digit growth in the developed markets, indicating the continued health of our core business.","Sales to our worldwide industrial category, which includes the materials characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, were down 3% in the quarter. The decline was most notable in mass spec sales to chemical food environmental customers due in part to territory realignments mentioned before. Sales growth within TA continued the strong momentum seen last year growing at 6% and giving us confidence in the positive outlook for our industrial category as volume in our thermal and reality product lines has been our best proxy for industrial end market demand. We continue to be excited about our product positions and pipeline, as well as the breadth of opportunity across materials characterization, food safety and environmental applications.","Looking at our governmental and academic category, we saw sales grew by 7% in Q1, with strong growth in China, driven by food research applications, partly offset by weakness from biomedical research customers in the developed markets.","Next I will review our sales performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest region in terms of revenue, was flat in the first quarter as weakness in India offset high-single-digit growth in China, despite a greater than 20% comp in the prior year\u2019s quarter. China is off to a solid start this year and met our expectations during the quarter.","Turning to the Americas, overall sales grew 4% in the quarter. While sales within the U.S. grew 5%. Sales growth trends in the U.S. continue to improve with strength in TA Instruments, as well as solid growth in pharma, partially offset by weakness in biomedical research markets.","In Europe, sales were up 2% in the quarter. Industrial, as well as academic and government were a drag on the region while European pharmaceutical demand remained robust. We saw strength in large molecule applications where we are well positioned with our targeted LCMS and biopharmaceutical analytical solutions. We also saw a strong service revenue from our large and growing base of installed systems.","Finally, I\u2019ll review product line dynamics within our waters and TA brands. Waters branded instrument sales were down 4% in the quarter, driven by the previously mentioned mass spec weakness. On the other hand, we were pleased with our sales of chromatography instruments. Within LC I would like to highlight two meaningful recent product launches that give us confidence in ongoing strength. Early in the quarter we introduced the ACQUITY Arc Bio System, a versatile LC system that is specifically geared to GLP\/GMP laboratories for routine use with large molecule drugs. The ACQUITY Arc Bio allows customers to experience true plug-and-play HPLC and UHPLC bio separations and modernize existing legacy methods. Early response to the system has been very positive.","Additionally, earlier this month, Waters introduced ACQUITY UPLC PLUS series, a series of three new ACQUITY systems with unparalleled, flexibility, performance and ease of use ideal for complex sample characterization in research and development through roofing product release testing these systems offer a two-fold to four-fold improvement in carry over performance resulting in improved sensitivity and characterization of samples.","Waters branded recurring revenues, which reflect the combination of service and precision chemistries and represent approximately 50% of the business\u2019 total sales grew 6% in the quarter. Recurring revenues were driven by global strengthen in our service sample prep and application kits and various other complete chemistry offerings.","Turning to our TA product line, sales increased 6% in the quarter. Instrument sales for TA increased 6% as well and service sales increased 5%. There was broad based sales growth across our key thermal, microcalorimeter and electroforce product lines. In particular, growth within our Discovery line of thermal analyzers has been very strong. Our new DMA 850, the newest product in the Discovery series is easier to use and raises the bar in performance, offering a 100-fold improvement in displacement resolution. Looking ahead we continue to see opportunities to capitalize on the market trend of rising innovation in highly engineered, high performance materials.","In summary, we delivered on the EPS line in Q1, but clearly had a weaker start to 2018, than we expected on the revenue line. We fully understand the factors that led to the Q1 shortfall in revenue versus our expectations, believe they were transients in nature and maintain a positive growth outlook for the remainder of the year. Our key growth drivers remain intact, including global pharma demand, China market strength and an overall robust business model that include consistent recurring revenues. We expect these factors to support solid growth in 2018.","As always we remain steadfast we focus on executing our five point value creation model. As we have previously communicated we aim to create shareholder value by first, holding a focused and highly differentiated leadership position in structurally attractive markets; second, executing a clear growth strategy, driven by organic innovation; three, seeking opportunity for continuous operational improvement; fourth being a disciplined capital allocator; and fifth, operating with a performance-oriented culture and management team.","I would like to make a few incremental comments related to capital allocation. We prioritize our capital allocation in three buckets, number one, invest in the business; number two, maintain our balance sheet, strength and flexibility; and number three, return capital to shareholders. Now with access to our global cash and substantially increased financial capacity following U.S. tax reform, we see opportunities in all three of these capital allocation buckets. In line with our first priority of investing in the business, we had another quarter of robust R&D investment. And we recently announced a $215 million capital investment to transform our strategically differentiated precision chemistry operation in Taunton, Massachusetts. This investment will create even more impactful precision chemistry center of excellence that will enable us to serve the strong growth in customer demand that we expect, enhance our chemistry innovation capability and support ongoing operational efficiency gains.","With respect to returning capital to shareholders, as communicated in our earnings press release today, our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $3 billion share repurchase program targeted to be completed over a three-year period. As previously noted, this is incremental to the remaining $526 million in our prior program authorization. As you are well aware we have a long-term, well-established, share repurchase program in place which has created significant value for our shareholders. We believe this new authorization underscores our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders in a disciplined fashion, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. Sherry will provide further details relating to capital allocation in her comments.","And with that I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of our first quarter financials. Sherry?","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris. And good morning everyone. In the first quarter we recorded net sales at $531 million, an increase of approximately 2% before currency translation. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 5% resulting in 7% sales growth as reported. In the quarter sales into our pharmaceutical markets grew 3%, sales into our industrial markets declined 3% and sales to academic and governmental customers grew 7%. Looking at our product line growth our recurring revenue which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue grew 6% in the quarter and was partially offset by a 2% decline in instrument sales.","As we noted last quarter, recurring sales were impacted by one last calendar day in the quarter which resulted in a slight reduction in service revenue sales. Looking ahead there's no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters, but there is one additional calendar day in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2017. Breaking products sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services grew 1%, while sales of TA branded products grew 6%. Combined LC and LCMS instrument platform sales decreased by 4%. And TA\u2019s instrumentation system sales grew 6%.","As Chris already shared we are encouraged by the strong start in TA instruments as we saw the benefits of new product introductions and positive industry dynamics. Our total recurring revenues associated with both waters and TA products grew by 6%. Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and before currency translation, sales in the Americas were up 4%, with sales in the U.S. up 5%. European sales were up 2% and sales in Asia were flat with sales in China up 7%.","Now I'd like to comment on a first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.3% versus 57.6% and the first quarter of 2017, in line with our expectations. Moving down the first quarter P&L, operating expenses were up approximately 1% on a constant currency basis. And foreign currency translation increased operating expense growth by approximately 7% on a reported basis. In the quarter our effective operating tax rate was 11%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, which was better than expected, due to the timing of discrete items in the quarter.","Net interest expense was $4.2 million, down $1.2 million from the prior year as a result of debt repayments in the quarter as part of our capital allocation framework. Our average share count came in at 79.7 million shares or approximately 1.1 million shares lower than in the first quarter of last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter were up to 9% to a $1.59 in comparison to earnings of a $1.46 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were a $1.40 versus a $1.31 last year. A reconciliation at our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning.","Turning to free cash flow, capital allocation and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our Q1 results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the first quarter of 2018 free cash flow came in at $160 million after funding $16 million of capital expenditures. This represents a strong start to the year as we were able to convert $0.30 of free cash flow from each dollar of sales. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, beginning with investing for growth, we announced a significant $215 million investment in our precision chemistry operation in Taunton. The cash outflows will be spread over the five-year project with approximately $30 million of capital expenditures expected in 2018.","We remain focused on a strong and flexible balance sheet as part of our capital allocation framework. As a result of U.S. tax reform we now have access to our cash outside of the U.S. which was $3.4 million at December 31, 2017. We've utilized a portion of that balance to pay down our bank revolver and a maturing note by $750 million which drove the reduction in our interest expense in Q1 versus the prior year.","In terms of returns to shareholders in the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $275 million. These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow resulted in cash and short term investment of $2.6 billion and debt of $1.3 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter resulting in net and a net cash position of $1.3 billion. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 85 days this quarter which was comparable to the first quarter of last year. In the quarter inventories increased by $30 million in comparison to the prior quarter but just in line with typical seasonal patterns.","As we look forward to the balance of the year, I'd like to comment on our full year 2018 guidance. Our outlook assumes continued global growth and demand from a pharmaceutical end markets, year-over-year growth in our industrial markets and consistent growth in our recurring revenue. These dynamics, along with our first quarter performance support full year 2018 guidance for constant currency sales growth in the mid-single-digit range, which we define as 4% to 6% unchanged from our previous guidance. At current rates currency translation is assumed increase 2018 sales growth by approximately 2% to 3%. Gross margin guidance for the year is unchanged at 58.5% to 59%. Our plan for the full year is to continue managing operating expense growth at a rate that is below our sales growth rate.","Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million. This assumes that the debt repaid in the first quarter is not re-borrowed during the course of the year. Our full year tax rate guidance is unchanged and an effective tax rate of 13% to 15%.","Regarding capital allocation, we plan to allocate approximately $800 million to share repurchases during 2018 reflecting a significant increase in share repurchases versus the prior year of approximately 50% of adjusted free cash flow to greater than 100%. This will result in an average diluted share count of about 78.5 million shares outstanding, which is consistent with our January 2018 guidance. The additional $3 billion authorization and the remaining $526 million, which Chris discussed earlier is to be completed over a three-year period. Use of the additional $3 billion authorization is not contemplated in our full year EPS guidance.","Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP full year 2018 earnings per fully diluted share projected in the range of $8.10 to $8.30, revised from a previous range of $8 to $8.25. At current rates the favorable foreign currency impact on full year earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 1%.","Looking at the second quarter of 2018, we expect 4% to 6% sales growth. At today's rates currency translation is expected to increase second quarter sales growth by approximately 2% to 3%. Combining these top line factors with our moderate increase in expenses, we estimate second quarter earnings per fully diluted share in the range of a $1.85 to a $1.95 with an approximately 1% positive impact from foreign currency translation at current rate.","Now I'd like to turn the call back to Chris. Chris?","Chris O'Connell","Great, thank you Sherry. As we move through 2018 we will continue to emphasize execution across our businesses. As I stated before, while we delivered on the earnings line, we did not meet our top line expectations in Q1. We understand the causes are addressing them now and our key business drivers provide us with confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year and for the long-term.","With that we will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not able to always get everyone\u2019s questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact the Waters Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, can we have the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we are ready to being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for our first question. Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Tycho Peterson","Hey thanks. Chris, I wanted to start, as you might not be surprised with mass spec weakness. I assume will be people kind of honing on that. I guess can, you get us comfortable that this was really due the territory realignment and not a competitive issue or demand side issue? And maybe can you just talk to what drove the salesforce alignment in the first place?","Chris O'Connell","Sure yes, I know. Tycho thanks for the question. As you know the mass spec business is traditionally lumpy for us and particularly in the first quarter of the year. So let's keep the context of the first quarter. And speaking directly to the territory realignment we have done a lot of interesting work on enhancing our growth strategies. And in the U.S. and in Western Europe as well we've made some very important changes that will help the business, we've added positions. And I honestly say that some of that process took a little longer through the quarter and impacted the quarter a little bit more than we expected. It's behind us now and we do expect improvement. We are not assuming an immediate bounce back, but we're certainly assuming an improvement.","As it relates to our position in mass spec, we feel really good about our product position in the core tandem quad area. As you know the Xevo TQ-XS is a relatively new product in the market that's making a lot of progress across different research applications including bio analysis. We've got strength with our TQ-S micro with a very accessible simple tandem quad and the TQD, we have strength of the single quad categories well with the QDa.","I think in the area of high resolution mass spec, we have a good solid platform, but we also have a lot of exciting new technology coming to that field. So we feel good about our pipeline, as well. And again I think we just saw in the quarter a little more accentuated lumpiness particularly in a couple of key end markets like biomedical research and we saw that primarily in the U.S. market. And that combined with some of the earlier disruption on territory realignment kind of compounded to create that difference.","So again we're looking at the rest of the year, we're looking at the core demand that we see really in all markets in a good product portfolio and are confident that we'll see recovery there.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, and then for the follow-up industrial obviously TA did well. Industrial overall still got a bit here. Can you maybe just talk about where you're feeling better exiting the quarter and any commentary on how things have trended in April on the industrial side?","Chris O'Connell","Yes I mean industrial was a little slow off to start as you pointed out a small decline. Keep in mind we had a 9% comp in prior year industrial. I'd say interestingly in industrial one of the main culprits was China. Industrial was a little bit lumpy there we had a very strong quarter in China Pharma which is really our core. But as we looked at a couple of geographies in particular partially affected by some of that mass spec commentary, some of the miscellaneous areas were a little weak in industrial. But as you sort of point out TA Instruments it\u2019s really our best proxy for the industrial market category and TA was rock solid across the board really every geography in a broad participation of product lines from thermal, to reality, to microcalorimeter and even electroforce. And really give us that confidence that the industrial end markets are promising for the year. That's certainly backed up by a lot of the macro economic data that we see. And so we have high expectations for our industrial category over the balance of the year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay, thank you.","Chris O'Connell","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open you may ask your question.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. So first off given the Q2 guide, it looks like you're expecting about a 6% organic revenue growth rate in the back half of the year to hit the low end of the 40% range for the total year. So curious if you could elaborate on the visibility towards that, especially given that some of the back half comps are rather challenging in some of your markets?","Chris O'Connell","Yes maybe I'll make a quick comment Dan and then Sherry can certainly add to comment on guidance. But as traditionally we see early in the year we do plan for balance across our markets, our geographies and our product lines. At this point in the year we still see a decent balance between pharma and industrial and some of the research categories. Certainly from a geography standpoint we feel the U.S. is in better shape heading into the year than it was a year ago with continued positive outlook for big geographies like China and Europe. Obviously we've talked about India. I think the India \u2013 the last year in India is easier to see in retrospect especially the dynamic at the end of the March fiscal year. And so we're confident in the India situation recovering. So I think we're looking at pretty decent conditions from an assumption standpoint.","But as always I'll also comment that we don't assume that everything goes right in making our assumptions. We try to put a plan together that seeks to balance the changes and assumptions that inevitably occur over the course of the year. And so our models for the year do not indicate a best case scenario, it really is a balanced scenario like we always try to do coming into a year. Sherry, you want to add to that? ","Sherry Buck","Yes so just building off of that our revenue guidance is the 46% and the FX is expected to be positive about 2% to 3%, might take an opportunity to talk about the EPS. We\u2019ve raised it at the midpoint, the factors going into that were upbeat Q1, some improvement in FX and interest and remaining constant on our full year tax rate guidance. We had some favorability from discrete items in the quarter but expect that to normalize. So those are the factors that go into the EPS guidance.","Dan Leonard","Yes I appreciate that. And then for my follow-up, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on India. How much of the year end dynamic here do you think was related to GST, versus maybe some price declines in the generics markets or any other factors that you could flag?","Chris O'Connell","Sure happy to comment further on India. I would say that we didn't fully anticipate the kind of end of year buying behavior of these companies after the year they've been through. We did mention GST, we talked a lot about that last year. I think we really felt that the bulk of that hit in our third quarter last year which would have been India\u2019s second quarter. And we did see some improvement in Q4. There were also other things going on in the Indian economy such as demonetization and other regulation changes. And really at the end of the year a lot of the multinational Indian customers which represent the vast majority of our customer base were cautious and they pushed business into the year we just started. They were cautious because they were protecting their balance sheets and P&Ls like you might expect.","I was actually in India about three or four weeks ago, personally. And what I can tell you from my visit is that the order pipeline was solid. We did have a little bit of a backlog build in India as a result of this dynamic which gives me some confidence. And I think the overall tone of the customers was positive. I spent a full day in Hyderabad visiting pharmaceutical customers of all types. I met with three CEOs of Indian pharmaceutical customers. And I can tell you that market continues to invest, that market continues to compete for the largest share of the worldwide generic drug market. And as you know India historically has not always been on a straight line and sometimes there were fits and starts. And I think that\u2019s what we've seen with a little bigger accentuation given that the end of year dynamics.","So overall our outlook for India is positive. We're confident in our team. Like with the mass spec point earlier we're not actually assuming it all bounces back immediately. We expect improvement in the current quarter and then continuing improvement upon that. So I think we've taken a balanced outlook, but I think have a very good handle on the Indian dynamic, but it definitely was a pothole in the quarter.","Dan Leonard","Appreciate all that color. Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Ross Muken","I just want to pulling in again just on Q2. So if we just do the walk from Q1 to Q2 obviously it seems like on the capital equipment side is still being priorities [ph] declining. Can you kind of confirm that because that\u2019s the only way I could see you guys getting to sort of 2% to 3% growth? And then is there a way you can size kind of the level of disruption of the mass spec just because it feels like relevant to the size of that business overall and sort of first half growth we're going to see from this business which is kind of below, yes well below the mid singles we\u2019re used to. It's got to be a pretty decent up the delta versus just India or some of the other parts that seem a bit maybe off from what was originally anticipated?","And because we imply again to Dan\u2019s question the implied back half around has to that on the instrument side just given the comps. And so I'm just trying to figure out all of that math.","Chris O'Connell","Yes Ross maybe I'll make a \u2013 try to make a general comment. Again we don't want to really break out everything in excruciating detail because very well that this business is hard to look at on a one quarter basis and I wouldn't want to over extrapolate one quarter. You really have to look at it over a rolling basis. But if you look at it the midst to our expectations and I won't perfectly quantify it, but I look at \u2013 what the way I look at it is we have a certain expectation for our business. And what I'm focused on is where the delta was relative to our expectations and that's why I highlighted mass spec in India.","About three quarters of the miss in our expectations related to the mass spec category just to give you a little bit a feel. And we think the reasons within that category are very explainable, very understandable, very addressable. As you know also that Q1 is our smallest quarter and tends to be more variable. On the mass spec side we have 80% of the year remaining. And we typically see investments particular in mass spec really balanced over the course of the year that's the dynamic we saw last year and what we're planning on for the rest of this year.","Ross Muken","And in terms of just the ordering dynamic over the balance of the quarter into Q2, can you give us a little bit of color there because again it just \u2013 I think I'm just getting a good sense as I\u2019m not the only one a little bit confused on sort of the cadence. I mean how much conservatism is built into that sort of Q2 number because it doesn't feel like there's much implied that comes back versus the back half where you've certainly got more of a ramp. So \u2013 is it the order rate you're seeing that's not coming through yet and so you're being more conservative, or is it just given what happened in Q1 you\u2019d prefer not to sort of set expectations for Q2 that are overly aggressive just given you still have some uncertainty on India and few of the other part?","Chris O'Connell","I don't know there might be a little bit of \u2013 that interpretation might be a little bit conservative. And the way I'd say it is if we had a gap in Q1, we're expecting kind of an equal part recovery of that gap over the course of the year. We've not assumed to your point an immediate snap back, but we're also not pushing it all to the back half of the year either. We do expect improvement and to make up some of our gap from Q1 in Q2 and we expect kind of a relatively equal proportion of that make up over the course of the year. We \u2013 giving us confidence in making that statement include some of the things I've said around these specific issues that held us back in Q1, as well as a reasonable order pipeline heading into the quarter. We don't want to quantify our backlog per our usual practice, but we do a good about our order pipeline heading into the quarter.","Ross Muken","And just to be clear, just to triple check, the 2Q organic guide is 2% to 3%, correct, not 4% to 6%? Because I think what Sherry said that it was sort of not obvious to us, a number of us if that was reported organic.","Sherry Buck","Yes just to clarify that our guidance is 4% to 6% constant currency growth and we expect FX to have an impact of 2% to 3%.","Ross Muken","Okay, well that changes things. So that's a huge clarification. I'm glad I checked, then done the ramp in the back half makes more sense, because I think a number of us were assuming it was 4% to 6% reported and then less the FX, so that makes it a lot more helpful. Alright, thank you so much for that clarification.","Chris O'Connell","Yes and I hope and that makes the comments about how we expect to build over the year to be pretty steady how that will\u2026","Ross Muken","Yes because you could see without that otherwise it looks like a hockey stick, right. Thank you.","Chris O'Connell","Yes it\u2019s sort of a hockey stick.","Ross Muken","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Amanda your line is open go ahead with your question.","Amanda Murphy","My apologies, can you hear me now? Sorry about that. I just had a quick question on the recurring side of the business. So obviously it's still a pretty good number with the 6%, I think, you said. And if you look historically that number has reached kind of high-single-digits at some point and obviously you\u2019ve talked about demand between transitioning to UPLC and attach rates there. So just hoping to get some clarity around how you expect recurring sales fuel trend over time and is there anything specific in this quarter to keep in mind that's related to the 6% growth rate number?","Chris O'Connell","No Amanda I think to be recurring revenues by a large met our expectations. Sherry did mention, there was one fewer selling day in the quarter which is a small matter but some service plans are booked by selling day, that you has a tiny effect. Really we feel very good about our service business in terms of the rising attach rates of service plan contracts continued contribution of our professional services line. And then from a consumable standpoint does to your point as we continue to see UPLC find its way into more and more applications. We do operate with higher margin chemistries and higher attach rates.","So we feel that that like we've seen in history that the recurring side of the business should grow at or slightly ahead of the rate of the corporate average.","Amanda Murphy","Okay, and just one more on this sales force realignment I know you said about this earlier a bit but, I still need to get a little more clarity there in terms of kind of what drove that you talked about that is that sort of is that \u2013 are you kind of complete with that process and thinking about doing that in other areas of the business?","Chris O'Connell","I don\u2019t know that I have a lot more to add it's very much a routine process in building our sales force in terms of both expanding it as well as giving us more end customer specific capabilities. We were really excited about some of the evolutions we're making, most of that was in the U.S. and some in Western Europe in the quarter although as you know we continue to add significantly in Asia. But we ended up with more open territories over the course of the quarter than originally planned. And good news is that that hiring process has gone well. It affected us a little more than we thought, but just wanted to give you some flavor for that type of transition and its contribution to what we saw in the quarter. But we feel good about our team and we're excited about these evolutions which are very natural as a company scales and builds out the channel.","Amanda Murphy","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question your line it's open.","Puneet Souda","Yes hi. Thanks Chris. I hate to bring this up on an mass spec again, but just trying to understand specifically is this associated with the Q tough [ph] and any sense of increasing competition from high resolution mass specs there? Or is this just broadly across the triples and the Q toughs [ph]? And do you \u2013 how do you think about the longer term position here for Waters as bio molecules will increasingly become a larger part of the mix here? And at least in the developmental phase of pharma you are going to require high res and OMEX focused to mass specs? Hoping to just understand the longer term picture and maybe in the near-term just dynamics on the Q tough [ph] and the triples. Thank you.","Chris O'Connell","Yes thanks Puneet. I appreciate the question. In the quarter I mentioned some of the higher resolution mass spec and clearly a little lumpier in that higher end category I did also mention our product position in tandem quads in the market now being very strong and our pipeline being very, very strong at the higher-end. I agree with you. I think the evolution of mass spec technology in the biomolecules, particularly in development and ultimately in the later-stage operational regulated workflows is a big trend.","I think we're investing towards that. We're very excited about the progress of our bio tough system in product development \u2013 in the later stages of product development. We also have a number of other very significant advances in the highest resolution mass spectrometry area that we don't want to talk too much about right now, but you know over the coming year we will.","And so we feel good about the future of this particular product line and the innovations that we're bringing forward, and expect that over the course of the year some of the things that held us back in Q1 to correct themselves.","Puneet Souda","Okay, thanks. And on India specifically. Just wanted to understand, in terms of the product mix itself, has that changed a bit? I know traditionally it was all largely alliance and lately has that product mix changed or is it evolving more towards the UPLCs? Thanks for taking my questions.","Chris O'Connell","Yes India is by and large an HPLC market but it's also a very strong informatics market as well. And really it's in that core pharma area that we saw the weakness in the quarter. We have a small bright spot in India in more of the government sectors or relates to mass spec for food applications, but that's a pretty small part of the business. So I think the Indian market is going to continue to be dominated by the pharma world particularly the generic pharma world. And beyond that probably the area that that we see the most potential in is the food testing area.","Puneet Souda","Okay, great thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your may ask your question, your line is open.","Derik De Bruin","Hi Puneet has actually asked part of my question. I was going to talk about the \u2013 on the LC side about the mix in India. But I'm just curious on the sort of the new acuity product launches that you just put out, I mean can you maybe just talk about where we are in the developed markets in terms of upgrade replacement cycles and just or like where the underlying demand is for new ACQUITYs. I mean you\u2019ve come off a couple of very strong years of your developed pharma customers buying products. I'm just curious in terms of where you sort of see underlying demand for the new products?","Chris O'Connell","Sure. So the two new products are the ACQUITY PLUS, which is an enhancement of the overall ACQUITY platform it\u2019s outlined in then the ACUITY ARC bio, which is taking the arc platform, which as you know is a transitional technology between HPLC and UHPLC methods. And making it more directly compatible with bio molecules just like we have an UPLC already the ACQUITY bio now we have the ACQUITY ACR bio. Interesting enough the ACQUITY ACR historically has been a little more of an emerging markets product is strongest start off the launch was really in China. But as we see the trend of product development on a large molecule we see this ACQUITY ACR bio being much more broadly adopted product and we\u2019re excited about that.","On the ACQUITY PLUS, I think, that just adds to the breadth and strength of the family and again the key driver for UPLC methods has been in some of the more \u2013 in really biotech end of the market and new drugs that are being developed. There we've talked about before there's really not an upgrade cycle as it relates to people migrating a particular molecule from HPLC to UPLC it's really when new molecules are being developed. And certainly as we look at some of the bigger opportunities in developing QA\/QC in biotech, UPLC is really going to be the standard we believe and that's why we continue to invest in that platform.","Derik De Bruin","Just a quick follow-up financial question for Sherry. Sherry when you look at that tax rate I mean it's going to a lot of variability over the last couple years I know some of that is just because the tax law changes. Is that I mean should we just \u2013 given that you typically tend to come in the lower end of the ranges I mean should we just model 13% for the full year just as a way to look at it, or \u2013 I guess basically what drives at the tax rate up to the 15% range when you just sort of look at historically the company always seems to manage to squeeze out a couple of percent of lower taxes once you guide to?","Sherry Buck","Derik this is Sherry. So on our tax rate I'd say the impact of tax reform is really what is driving our full year guidance to the 13% to 15% versus last year. It's about 2% higher. I say there's still a lot of moving parts and really seeing all the regulations coming out supporting the U.S. tax reform Q1 I can say was one more favorable than what we were expecting because of some very discrete items. Our expectation is, is that will normalize throughout the remaining quarters. And so our full guidance still remains at 13% to 15%. And I wouldn't necessarily assume that it would be at the lower end.","Derik De Bruin","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Doug Schenkel","Good morning. You usually tell us to model to the midpoint of the guidance range. That said coming off a weaker than expected Q1 and recognizing that Q1 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry Q2 guidance does not seem to embed much of a catch up. Is it fair to say you're more comfortable at the lower end of the 4% to 6% full year core revenue growth range, at least relative to where we were back in early January when you initially provided guidance?","Chris O'Connell","No I don't think so. I think we've tried to provide a balanced outlook. And maybe it's oversimplifying but at the lower end of the range that would assume a slower recovery of some of the factors we've talked about and at the higher end of the range that would assume a higher and faster recovery. And both scenarios are possible. And that\u2019s why we try to give a range that incorporates a reasonable probability of anything in the range which would kind of land us towards that midpoint.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. North America was one of the geographic regions where you performed relatively well. That said it was against a pretty favorable comparison especially in the United States. With that in mind how much of Q1 performance in the region would you ascribe to improving demand and execution versus the favorable comp in a more normalized budget release this year relative to what you described in Q1 of 2017?","Chris O'Connell"," Yes I would agree that the U.S. was better, but we're not fully satisfied with the U.S. And you know Canada was a little bit down which impacted North America but Canada tends to be quite lumpy given that it's driven more by tenders. I think the U.S. is still a work in process and some of the territory realignment I outlined earlier was a factor in the U.S. So I'm watching the U.S. very closely I have high hopes for the U.S. I think the U.S. is a solid market and certainly feels better as a market towards the end of last year and heading into this year than it did a year ago because I recall a year ago there were so many questions about tax reform and other government policy that it was a sluggish start to the year.","So we saw improvement in the U.S. over the course of the year, it's okay right now starting off in this year but I actually expect better from the U.S. as well.","Doug Schenkel","Okay thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Dan Arias with Citi Research. Your line is open, you may ask your question.","Dan Arias","Hey good morning. Thank you. Chris just given how tied they are to one another does the mass spec softness impact the healthy forecast for the year? And I guess have you seen any or do you expect any decoupling so to speak in terms of the percentage of water is healthy systems that go out the door with one of your mass spec devices on the back?","Chris O'Connell","No I don't there's a direct tie, I think the mass spec factors that hit us in the quarter were somewhat isolated to some of the dynamics I described earlier. And then like I implied in the call if you look at the core LC instrumentation we did we did just fine we met our expectations and we feel good about our portfolio and the outlook for the year. So we like our strategic position in having a strong LC and mass spec combination. And we expect to leverage that advantage throughout the future in particular bringing more and more LC plus MS type workflows together. So I think I wouldn't read too much into the LC business on that score.","Dan Arias","Okay. And then maybe on the industrial side how would you sort of rank the application areas in terms of strength of demand right now for materials, food, environmental and chemicals? Are you able to sort of touch on what your expectations are on at least a relative basis there out of those buckets for the year?","Chris O'Connell","Yes I'd say in general the part of the materials our industrial franchise that we feel best about right now is really in the core TA thermal reality type business. And that had a good year last year, a good finish, a good start to this year. As we've talked about we feel good about the industrial end markets overall, we feel great about our product position in that category. And really besides that I'd say the food category is one that's garnered a lot of attention. I think there's a lot of interest in a broad range of players in food safety and food testing. In fact I was personally invited last week and participated in a IMF World Bank panel in Washington D.C. with a variety of health ministers talking about capacity building and investments in countries of all types, including lesser developed countries in food safety testing methods.","And our organization has done a great job over time really developing a presence of mind in that market in thought leadership. And so I think in the short and long term we expect that market to be a priority for us and for the world. Really if you look at all the categories you described, I think, outlook for us is more balanced and that's certainly what we're expecting out of those end markets and we'll continue to provide color as that develops.","Dan Arias","Okay, I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. You may ask your question. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thanks, good morning. So I just want to be clear, do you think there are any changes in the competitive environment in the quarter and some of the loft [ph] mass spec sales did those go to competitors or can you elaborate on just why you think they'll come back in over the next few quarters?","Chris O'Connell","Yes Jack I think I've covered the specific dynamics in terms of what we think happened in the quarter again a smaller lumpier quarter for us some things accentuated that. And no I don't think there was any change in competitive dynamic in the quarter. If you take a look back at last year, we had a really solid mass spec year in 2017, we grew in the upper single digits in mass spec for the year last year. And it's not like we come into Q1 and all of that changes. We like our competitive position in mass spec. There's some areas that we have a stronger position in the market and others where we have a strong product development pipeline.","So I think our view is that those factors that I described fully earlier explain the quarter. We're watching it closely, we\u2019re intent upon demonstrating improvement and continue to give you color on it. But the overall competitive dynamic, I think, doesn't change in one quarter like that.","Jack Meehan","Great, thank you Chris. And then the new share repurchase authorization, do you think the rate you're running in 2018 is going to be sustainable over the next few years? Can you just put in the context of the long-term guidance that you laid out at the previous Analyst Day?","Chris O'Connell","Yes, so I'll make a quick comment and have Sherry go further. We're really excited about this share repurchase authorization and obviously with all the newness of tax reform and the need to get an understanding as to how the flows worked we've been intently working on this over the quarter. And clearly we announced at the beginning of this year a bigger share repurchase program for the year. We're really sticking to that, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance on our 2018 share repurchase program. But clearly we are looking to enhance that as we move from there and keep a strong range of cash return to shareholders in the coming years.","So in terms of in terms of guidance on our share repurchase program I would focus on what we said today, what we said at the outset of the year and then we'll continue to update that as we move through the year in terms of what 2019, 2020, 2021 will look like. But Sherry you want to say more?","Sherry Buck","Sure, yes, so just that jumping into that, so for of the current year 2018 our plan is $800 million worth of share repurchases. With the new authorization, with what we have remaining from first quarter on that and the new one so a total of $3.5 billion to be spread over three years. So we feel really good about the sustainability over the next three years to be able to return, really greater than one hundred percent of our free cash flow to share repurchases. And that's up from 50% last year. So we have $800 million baked into our guidance. And we\u2019ll evaluate opportunities as we go, but I think it's just reinforcing our sustained share buyback program over the next several years.","Jack Meehan","Great. Thank you, Sherry.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Jeremy Rosenberg with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. You may ask your question.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi this is Steve Beuchaw on for Jeremy Rosenberg. First I just want to unpack China a little bit. Chris you made a couple of really helpful comments about China. Number one, spiking out that the industrial piece of it was maybe a little slower. And two, spiking out that the pharma piece of China was really healthy. I wonder if we could just unpack that a little bit more. Have you seen any improvement in the China industrial trend? How do you expect that to play over the balance of the year? And on the pharma front when you say China was good I mean is China on the pharma side of it holding up one hundred percent, or is it may be moderated just a little?","Chris O'Connell","Yes I know I think Steve your read of it is very accurate, the themes are correct and I don't want to overly quantify it. But there's also a tale of the comparison as well China had a fantastic quarter a year ago and a very significant quarter in both pharma and industrial. So about half of the business in China is pharma and we were pleased with our China pharma growth on a very big comp. Industrial was off a little bit again due to some of the traditional lumpiness of those end markets, but again off a very, very large comp. The research sequitur was strong in China. As I mentioned particularly in the governmental food research areas. And I contrast that with the independent lab food testing which was more in the industrial category, but the research end of that was very strong and drove growth in China with a little easier of a comparison.","So overall we expected the type of performance that we saw in China. And all of our assumptions in terms of what we're expecting for the year in China are still out there for us and we're confident our team there.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, really helpful. I wonder though taking a step up toward 10,000 feet as we look at the model if it's possible that we're all just parsing this too finally. When I look at the variation over the trends in growth in the last few quarters, couple of quarters, what stands out of course is the variation on instrument growth. In the fourth quarter it was a good quarter on top of an extremely difficult comp and here we are with instruments weaker on a comp that\u2019s a little bit more normal. Could the explanation for all this be something very, very simple? Did we just have budget flush in the fourth quarter and here in the first quarter there are some labs out there that are still hard at work, digesting all the stuff that they bought in the fourth quarter. Just that, thanks.","Chris O'Connell","Yes I guess if I go back to your first point there Steve, I think, sometimes the temptation is to parse things pretty finally on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But what we've seen in this business is that trends look \u2013 are a little more so explainable if you will over kind of a rolling period. So again we look at the quarter and the dynamics and we think a lot of the things that happened in the quarter are very specific and explainable at least from our standpoint to some dynamics in a couple of key products segments and geographies. And then we take a look at that and step back and look at trends that to your point come from prior year and extend out into this year and try to make a forecast as best we can on some of the broader macro trends. But at the end of the day the worldwide pharma market looks solid, this sector continues to invest, and produce and grow.","The industrial market by many measurements including some of our internal ones appears to be stable and robust and we see a good balance as we go over the course of the year. I can\u2019t explain questions of year end, or beginning of your budget flush and things like that, there are too many nuances in that equation and I wouldn't over interpret any of that. I would just take on its face some of the things that we've talked about in Q1. But also our read of the end markets will continue to lean into that. We\u2019ll continue to try to better understand these trends, and explain them best we can and make sure we're focused on executing against a variety of different assumptions in our plan.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay, thanks so much.","Chris O'Connell","I think we have time for one more if that's possible.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question then comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open you may ask your question.","Patrick Donnelly","Great, thanks. Chris maybe on the margin side if growth does remain a bit lower than anticipated where the real levers you could pull to drive expansion? And then does one quarter of low growth leads you to be more aggressive on the cost side or do you try to find balance of patients and then also still being nimble if things do slowdown for a bit here?","Chris O'Connell","Well again to your point on the margins, despite the softness on the top line in Q1, which is our smallest quarter of the year, we were very pleased with our operating performance and we delivered some modest operating leverage, while actually growing our R&D expense faster than our top line. So we continue to invest for growth. And of course we're anticipating an improvement in the revenue line. But we feel we have sufficient operating control to feel good about protecting our earnings although for us growth is the key.","We\u2019re investing for growth, we're expecting growth and we're expecting to work through some of the things that held us back in Q1. And deliver in that range of our guidance that we've given. ","Patrick Donnelly","Right, thanks.","Chris O'Connell","Okay I think we're out of time here. So I do want to thank everybody for your great questions.","In conclusion, we remain focused on delivering our growth plans for 2018, headlined by strength in our core pharmaceutical market, continued growth in TA and broad based growth in China. We believe that market conditions in our strong competitive position support continuing success. So on behalf of our entire management team I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters.","We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q2 2018 call which we currently anticipate holding on July 24, 2018. Thank you very much and have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Lynch","Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 23, 2018.","During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro-forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, John, good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Along with John Lynch, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, I will provide an overview of our Q3 and year-to-date operating results as well as some broader commentary on the business. Sherry will then review financial details for our reported results and provide an update on our Q4 and full-year 2017 financial outlook. We will then open up the lines for Q&A.","In summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, where we delivered solid revenue growth from each of our major customer defined end markets, as well as across all of our major product lines, well balanced between instrumentations and recurring revenue. Geographic strength continued in Asia and Europe, and importantly we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in the United States. ","Third quarter revenue has been totaled were up 6% compared to the same period in 2016, which built nicely upon our consistent quarterly results in the previous two quarters of 2017. This Q3 performance led to year-to-date revenue growth of 6% and a very strong P&L featuring operating leverage and consistent double-digit earnings per share growth of 13% for the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Additionally, we delivered another quarter of strong free cash flow bringing our year-to-date growth in free cash flow to 11%.","Taking a closer look and starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 5% in the quarter which is encouraging against a strong low teen base of comparison in the prior year. Our pharmaceutical growth was led by strength in large molecule and biomedical research applications. Geographic growth was balanced between our developed and emerging markets and we also absorbed some headwinds from the natural disasters in the Americas and meaningful timing delays in India caused by our customers' implementation of systems to accommodate the new goods and services tax protocols or GST. ","Year-to-date overall sales for our pharmaceutical markets were up 6% against the strong prior year performance. Our ongoing strategy work continues to emphasize the vast opportunities in our core pharmaceutical business where we believe we are very well positioned to benefit from rising global regulatory standards, increasing patient access to medical therapies and growing volumes of biologic therapies that require more demanding analytical testing methods. ","Sales to our worldwide industrial category which includes the materials characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets grew 5% in the quarter led by strength in material characterization. Overall, we have seen encouraging growth across applications within our industrial markets where year-to-date sales are growing 7%.","Looking at our governmental and academic category, we saw sales grow by 13% in Q3 with broad based performance across all major geographies. In the quarter, we experienced strength in spending from academic institutions focused on biomedical and Omex research. ","Now I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instruments sales grew 4% in the third quarter and are growing 4% year-to-date. Within instruments, I would like to particularly highlight our bench top LC tandem mass specs systems led by our higher-end GVO TQXS as well as the workflow GVO TQX Micro. Mass spec continues overall to grow solidly in the quarter and consistently year-to-date.","As we have commented on the past, we continue to see the expansion of mass spec technology into routine use quantification workflows primarily in food safety and biopharmaceutical applications. The development of our tandem, Quad [zero] platform has enabled us to meet evolving demand for reproducible quantification capabilities for both small and large molecules. ","Waters branded recurring revenues the combination of service and precision chemistries grew 8% in the quarter and now represent approximately 50% of our Waters business. Recurring revenues were driven by global strength of our service, HPLC and UPLC application kits and our complete chemistry offerings. Year-to-date our chemistry and service revenues have grown at 7% indicative of high utilization rates for our installed base of Waters instruments. ","Turning to our TA product lines, sales grew by 9% in the quarter bringing our year-to-date growth to 7%. Instrument sales for TA grew 12% in the quarter and continue to be led by our new discovery line of thermal analyzers introduced in 2016. This strong quarterly result also benefitted from the growth of rheology and high temperature thermal systems. We are well positioned to capitalize on market trends of rising innovation in highly engineered, high performance materials. ","Finally, I will review our performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest reach in terms of revenue grew by 8% again led by China which grew faster as well as Japan. ","Our China operation saw a solid growth from all of our core markets. Within the pharmaceutical category growth drivers continue to include new regulatory requirements for China\u2019s Food and Drug Administration. In the industrial category, China experienced strong growth across our materials characterization, food testing and environmental customers. Japan continue to benefit from strengthened governmental and academic customers and steady growth from pharmaceutical customers. ","As mentioned previously, disruptions associated with customers, implementations of the new GST reporting system impacted our results in India in the quarter, we expect this situation to smooth out over the next couple of quarters, with continued solid overall performance of our Indian business. ","Turning to the Americas. Sales were flat in the quarter, with our U.S. sales up 1% despite headwinds from recent natural disasters in the broader region. Macroeconomic and governmental policy uncertainties that we talked about last quarter, still persist, affecting general business activity in the United States, but we are seeing steady sequential improvement in line with our expectations. We are looking for continued improvement in the U.S. growth trends based on our strong product and market position. ","Europe was a strong contributor to the third quarter, with sales growing 13%, highlighted by broad-based growth from our pharmaceutical customers, across product categories and throughout the region. ","We saw strength in bio-pharma applications where we are well positioned with our targeted LCMS and a bio-molecule separation solution. We also saw strong service revenue from our large and growing base of installed systems. ","Commenting further on Europe, I was able to spend to sometime in the region this quarter with customers and employees. In addition to a deep dive into our high potential Eastern European operations, a highlight of this trip was my visit to the Water separation in Brasov Romania. The Brasov team has grown steadily over the years, into one of our top operational sites worldwide, recently this site became Waters Informatics Center of Excellence, supporting development of our Empower Chromatography Data Systems, Unified Software Technology and New Genesis Lab Management System as well as the development of LCMS and TA instrument drivers. During my visit we dedicated a modern new facility designed to enable collaboration and innovation. Our informatics offering is a key differentiator for Waters and Brasov is a significant contributor to this strength. ","So, as we head into the home stretch of 2017, I am pleased with the consistent top line and bottom line results the company has delivered for the first three quarters of the year. ","We also remain steadfastly focused on our five-point value creation model. As I have constituently communicated, we aim to create shareholder value by first holding a unique and highly differentiated position in structurally attractive markets. Second, executing a clear growth strategy driven by organic innovation. Third, seeking opportunity for continuous operational improvement. Fourth, being a disciplined capital allocator and fifth operating with a performance oriented culture and management team. ","Finally, I\u2019d like to comment on last week's announcement regarding the retirement of Doug Berthiaume as Chairman of the Board of Directors and my election as the new Chairman effective January 1, 2018. You all know Doug, as a visionary leader, who built the modern Water\u2019s and created significant value for shareholders. His achievements as Chairman and CEO have profoundly impacted our customers, employees, shareholders and the broader community. During the past two years in his role as Non-Executive Chairman, Doug has been invaluable mentor for me and orchestrated a smooth and productive transition. On a personal level, I am grateful for his example and his support and we\u2019ll continue to utilize him for advice and counsel. ","More broadly in my view, Waters has always been a model for good corporate governance with a rigorous cadence to Board meetings, robust transparency practices and a strong lead independent director. As part of this, I am pleased that Tom Salice will continue in his position as lead Director working very closely with to sustain and continuously enhance our governance practices. ","Furthermore, I will continue our efforts underway to ensure the optimal mix of backgrounds and capabilities for our Directors to our ongoing board development program. This initiative has already resulted in the recruitment of Dr. Flemming Ornskov, CEO of Shire Pharmaceuticals as a new Director of Waters. Flemming has now participated in two board meetings and has added valuable new insights to the Board and management team. I look forward to continuing to develop our Board, to ensure the highest possible quality and effectiveness of our governance practices. ","With that, I\u2019d like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of our third quarter financials. Sherry?","Sherry Buck ","Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. We recorded net sales in the third quarter of $566 million, an increase of about 6% before currency translation which increased sales growth in the quarter by about 1% and results again 7% reported sales growth. In the quarter, pharmaceutical markets grew 5%, our industrial markets also grew 5% and sales to academic and governmental customers were up 13%. Product line growth was strongest in our recurring revenue with the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue growing 7% while instrument sales grew 5% in the quarter. ","Breaking that down further, sales relating to Waters' branded products and services were up 6% while TA's grew 9%. Combined LC and LCMS instrument platform sales increased by 4% and TA\u2019s instrumentation system sales grew 12% as we continue to see the benefits of new product introduction. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 7%. ","Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter geographically, and before currency translation, sales in the Americas were flat with sales in the US increasing 1%. European sales were up 13%. Sales in Asia were up 8% led by strong growth in China and Japan. ","Now I would like to comment on our third quarter non-GAAP performance versus the prior year. Growth margins for the quarter were steady coming in at 58.3%. Positive mix dynamics and product manufacturing efficiencies were offset by approximately 30 basis points of currency headwinds from higher cost as a result of the UK pound and the euro.","Moving down the third quarter\u2019s P&L. Operating expenses were up 5% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency translation increased the operating expense growth by about 1% on a reported basis. Year-to-date sales have grown about 1% faster than operating expenses. On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate before effects of the new stock compensation rule for the quarter was about 14%.","This is the result of the mix of the legal entity process in the quarter. Including a $0.03 benefit from new stock option accounting rules, the non-GAAP effective operating tax rate was about 12%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $5 million down about $1 million from year. Our average share count came in at 80.5 million shares or approximately 900,000 shares lower than in the third quarter last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program. ","During the third quarter, we bought 4,37,500 shares of our common stock for $79 million. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the third quarter were up 13% to $1.77, in comparison to earnings of a $1.57 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.69, versus $1.53 last year. both our non-GAAP and GAAP earnings included benefit of $0.03 resulting from the new stock compensation accounting rules. ","The impacts of foreign currency translation in the quarter on earnings per share were a positive $0.01. keeping the year-to-date impact about neutral. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release, issued this morning. ","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $3.3 billion and debt totaled $2 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $1.3 billion. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the third quarter of 2017, cash flow was strong and came in at $134 million after funding $20 million of capital expenditures. Modest improvements in working capital efficiency and disciplined capital spending contributed to our cash generation. This represents both a strong quarterly performance and year-to-date growth of approximately 11%. ","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 73 days this quarter, which is down two days from the second quarter of this year and three days compared to Q3 of last year. In the quarter inventories were approximately $298 million compared to $303 million in the third quarter of the prior year which was in line with our expectations. ","As we look forward to the balance of the year, I\u2019d like to share our full year and fourth quarter 2017 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes continued global growth and demand from our end markets and consistent growth in our recurring revenue. Bringing this altogether we continue to expect constant currency sales to increase 5% to 6% for the full year. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to be neutral for the full year. ","Out outlook for gross margins for the year is consistent with our previous guidance, in the range of 58.5% to 59%. Higher volume and manufacturing efficiency gains are expected to continue to be offset by negative effects from foreign currency translation. Our plan for the year is to continue managing operating expense growth at a rate that is less than our sales growth. ","Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $22 million. We estimate our full year tax rate including an expected benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.19 due to new stock option accounting rules, to be about 12%. This is comprised of approximately $0.17 benefit realized year-to-date plus an assumed amount of $0.02 in the fourth quarter of this year. ","Quarter-to-quarter variation will reflect the timing of actual stock option exercises and our stock price. We continue to provide a reconciliation of this item with remainder of 2017. ","Our guidance regarding capital allocation assumes continuation of our share repurchase program for 2017, at a rate that will results an average diluted share count of about 80 million shares outstanding. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2017 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $7.38 to $7.48. At current rates, the foreign currency impact on full year earnings per share growth is expected to be about neutral. ","Looking at the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect constant currency sales growth in the range of 3 to 5% against a very strong basic comparison as well as another quarter of likely impact from hurricane affected areas. ","At today\u2019s rates, currency translation is expected to positively impact fourth quarter sales growth by about 2 to 3%. Combining these top line factors with a moderate increase in expenses and assumed $0.02 of tax benefit due to the new accounting standard, we estimate fourth quarter earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.38 to $2.48. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Chris. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Great, thank you Sherry. As we move into the fourth quarter, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core businesses and delivering on our operating performance objectives. As we have stated, we will seek the balance growth, operating leverage and investment in the business. With that, we will now open phone lines for Q&A. we are rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s question, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and if you have additional questions after the call, please contact our Investor Relations team. Operator, may we have the first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tim Evans","Hi, thank you. Can you perhaps give us a sense for how big the hurricane impact and the India GST impact was in the quarter and maybe also hope that you\u2019re expecting at least for Q4. ","Christopher O'Connell","Sure Tim, thanks for the question. We estimate that these one-timers that we refer to in the call hit our top line growth rate by about 1% and that was roughly equally split between the natural disasters in the Americas region and the India GST but as we commented, those factors will look a little bit different in the fourth quarter. We think that the India GST situation is working through as we speak and you know while we may not be completely out of the woods, we expect to recover that business steadily over the coming two or three quarters and that\u2019s really simply a delay in orders and shipments. ","From a natural disaster standpoint, it was really the US that took the majority of the hit in the third quarter where some of that risk shifts to Latin America for the fourth quarter but you know hopefully the impact will be somewhat less in Q4 than we saw in Q3. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming is from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey Thanks. Chris, I want to ask a little bit about kind of the bifurcation growth you\u2019re seeing out of Europe versus the US. You know the particular sub-segments in Europe that are driving 30% growth this quarter, I mean that certainly stands out and then conversely here in the US, I noticed it does feel slow a little bit sequentially versus an easier comp. Is that kind of dragging down the US market?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, yes. Thanks, Tycho for the question. There is definitely a bifurcation as you pointed out between the US and Europe and you know I\u2019ll first make a comment more on the pharmaceutical business. As you know the pharma business is a very global business and clearly what our experience here and sort of the short-term we are seeing the larger multinational pharma company is favoring. The more friendly operating environment in Europe, right now and that\u2019s obviously driven by more and more certain environment on tax and regulation and trade. ","And so, the U.S. does feel like its bending a little bit of wait and see mode, but like we said in the call, we definitely saw a sequential improvement in that tone in the U.S. certainly Q2 was better than Q1 and Q3 was better than Q2, so hopefully we\u2019re stepping out of that and as you know sometimes these companies have cycled their purchasing activity between the U.S. and Europe and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re seeing right now. ","In the industrial sector, we actually saw a growth in both the U.S. and in Europe, which was encouraging. Our industrial performance is pretty broad-based right now, and in academic and government we also saw a growth in both the U.S and in Europe. So really the U.S. versus Europe question is really trading-off pharma demand but like we said we\u2019re very encouraged with pharma demand overall, we think pharma demand is healthy, despite the near-term U.S. shift and the pharma growth that we saw in the quarter was obviously on tough comps as well as absorbing some of those one-timers that we just spoke about a few minutes ago. ","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, I know on biopharma, if you could just comment a little bit on where you are feeling better or worse, I know you like to talk about the increasingly broad customer base there and I know you highlighted large molecule but we get a lot of questions on the generic side given some of the headlines there, so I am wondering if you can comment on, what you are hearing from those customers as well?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, I think a lot of the themes that we saw in the quarter, Tycho were pretty similar to what we have been seeing all year and what I have been seeing over the past couple of years, the demand in generics is good. There is obviously some headlines with some bigger companies out there, but again keeping in mind that even in some of the larger generics companies that have had some difficulty, our business is much more a function of volume and production than it is about say new initiatives. ","But the generics market is very broad based, certainly the Indian business has been consistently strong despite the short-term dislocations with system implementation and GST and the U.S. continues to see new investment in generic categories from startup companies and mid-sized companies. And as I alluded into the call, the biopharma market has been really solid again, we continue to see the majority of the innovator companies focusing their investments on new analytical techniques for biopharma and as you heard at our analyst day and in subsequent investor conversations, we continue to highlight our strategy to win in that environment. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is coming from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you, Chris how are you thinking about the opportunity on the margin side as you head into 2018?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","Sure, margin is as I pointed out in the call on the value creation model, our margin philosophy and approach is to look for continuous improvement, obviously we operate at strong margins. As I said before, I think our margin profile is a unique reflection of our business model, and the concentration we have in highly attractive end markets and technologies and it's not a reflection of being optimized in any way and so we have a strong operational improvement initiative underway, where we think we can achieve modest ongoing operational improvements. ","If you look at our P&L year-to-date, we\u2019ve delivered operating leverage in the quarter and year-to-date on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis and so I think that mentality is going to continue into \u201918. We\u2019re not giving guidance on \u201918 yet and we\u2019ll certainly do that in the January call. But we will be looking at another solid year of revenue and looking to drive some modest operating improvements while continuing to invest in future growth particularly in R&D.","Maybe I\u2019ll take a moment while you raise that just to comment but one of the things I like most about our P&L both quarter-to-date and year-to-date is that we\u2019ve achieved a really nice leverage on the SG&A line while investing in R&D our year-to-date R&D investment on a constant currency basis is up about 10%. I mean that\u2019s really a reflection of our strong desire to continue to lead the industry and organic innovation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming is from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. The first one Sherry just a question I mean you\u2019re doing a $0.19 tailwind from the stock based comp this year. I guess can you talk about how you\u2019re looking at what that would translate over into \u201918 and obviously the follow-up question I mean there is obviously there is tax reform you\u2019re going to be able to repatriate some cash. Can you sort of talk about what cash is overseas and sort of what your initial thoughts would be, I assume you would use some of that to buy back shares to help offset this? What are the dynamics on the questions posed?","Sherry Buck","Sure, that\u2019s a really good question on the stock compensation impact for next year and I'd say it\u2019s a little bit too early as Chris talked about for our guidance for 2018. Probably the best comments here I can provide is we\u2019re looking at better operating tax rate and we would expect that to remain consistent in the mid-teens as you\u2019ve seen this year. ","And then switching to your next question on tax reform, as we shared with our team internally looking at the tax reform and we have an ad hoc finance committee meeting that is helping us also in this arena. And for us we have a lot of optionality and we obviously would look to continue our share repurchase program but it will free up quite a bit of cash on our balance sheet and as we think about deploying that and looking to invest in the business is important to us and looking at our debt profile as well as return to shareholders. And we think we have a lot of options and we\u2019re going to watch closely with the details of the tax reform emerges and put a fine point on it when we have some more details. I don\u2019t know Chris if you\u2019d like to add anything else?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","That\u2019s well said Sherry. ","Derik de Bruin","Okay, a follow-up question. Just wanted you to walk through the EPS bridge for the full year. It looks by my math, you're about a negative 2% FX headwind before and then now you\u2019re talking about initial lines of benefits it's like a $0.14 increase by my math and then you know obviously the increases sort of full year is not as high as we would have thought sort of based upon that math. I guess what\u2019s going on with the underlying business. It looks like it\u2019s a little bit lark, just walk through the EPS bridge.","Sherry Buck ","Yeah, so we're looking at the EPS bridge, basically as we look at our guidance, we\u2019re following through our Q3 and just a little bit of the FX and as Chris mentioned earlier, we\u2019re taking some of the FX upside and investing in the business through R&D year-to-date up about 10% on a constant currency basis, so really trying to balance the benefit of some of the operating leverage and investing in the business. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel ","Good morning. What was core revenue growth by each sub-segment within the food, environmental and core industrial category and could you provide any relevant details on trends within each sub-segment by geography?","Christopher O'Connell","Doug, I think we\u2019re not going to go breakout those details at that level granularity, but I\u2019d point you back to some of our general commentary. Our industrial business was quite well balanced actually across many of those different categories in food and materials characterization and environmental and it was really well balanced across our major geographies, U.S., Europe and China were all in positive territory on industrial and India was slightly negative in part due to the GST tax implementation, but these are smaller, much smaller number and industrial as you know with a bigger pharma business. ","So, I would just look at both quarter results, but also on industrial the year-to-date results and last 12-month results all in positive territory in the U.S., China and in Europe. ","Doug Schenkel ","Okay. Just flipping back to biopharma. You had a good year, but your biopharma revenue growth for the year has lagged the broader tools group at least the last couple of quarters. This may simply be a function of your concentration on certain product classes and company specific comparisons, that said Chris, how comfortable are you that competitive share shifts are not also a factor?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah, I guess as you sort of alluded to Doug, the basic comparison last two quarters of low teens growth in prior year has to be taken into consideration when looking at our pharma growth rate, but we have been really rock solid at 6% pharma growth both year-to-date as well as last 12 months and over almost any rolling period. I am confident that we are doing well from a share standpoint in the pharma business and if you compare our results over almost any rolling period to competition, I think you\u2019ll see that. ","We obviously do the best we can to look at market share data from different sources like SDI and the oldest survey and all of those surveys tend to reinforce the same point. As you know share can be very sticky in these markets. We have done a good job innovating and holding on these shares, certainly there are some categories where we have seen some pressure like high resolution Mass spectrometry in recent years, but we also are continuing to invest in new technology that will turn that in the other direction. ","In the heart of the LCMS world, we have done very well from a share standpoint, we believe especially with the broadening of our [indiscernible] product line that I talked about earlier and [indiscernible]. And as those two technologies continue to grow together and utilization we think we\u2019re well positioned for share gains in the future. ","And then our core LC business, we have got a very strong base of share that\u2019s really headlined by not just for multiple technology categories of HPLC and UPLC but also our empower chromatography data systems, keep in mind we own about two-thirds of the market for CDS, which gives us great visibility into what\u2019s happening with instruments in the market and is the major competitive advantage that only continues to be enhanced. So, we do try to study the share question as much as we can but we feel good about where we are.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thanks, and good morning guys. Chris, I was wondering, could you elaborate on the industrial trends in the quarter, obviously a great result from TA and as you think about the fourth quarter, a little bit of a tougher comp there. If you could talk about the setup that would be great?","Christopher O\u2019Connell","So, as you point out the industrial has been a good story all year long as just to reiterate our industrial growth year-to-date has been 7% and actually last 12 months has been 9% because as you allude to we did have a strong fourth quarter in industrial last year. I would say that the balance in our industrial performance is really good between TA and those Waters categories. And TA has really come on strong this year, TA has had a year as you\u2019ve seen that\u2019s developed well over the course of the year and this quarter we saw double digit instrument growth out of TA and naturally a reflection of this we believe is really a winning product strategy around the discovery line of thermal analyzers which as you know has been rolling out steadily since mid-2016 and we\u2019re still in the process of maturing that overall portfolio of tiered instruments for all the different thermal applications. ","I think we\u2019re also encouraged by the performance of some of the more recent acquisitions of TA, as you should know TA has a bit of a drum beat of small tuck-in product line acquisitions like the electro force group and [indiscernible] things we\u2019ve talked about in the past and a lot of those are also beginning to scale a little bit and give us strength and even a broader footprint in some of these industrial markets. ","So obviously we watch this closely, when we came into the year we were setting out to have good balance growth between pharma and industrial and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s played out over the course of year and I think one of the more satisfying aspects of the year-to-date so far. ","Jack Meehan","Great. And then just one for Sherry, you mentioned on gross margin FX is about 30 bp headwind that would imply about flat year-over-year or otherwise. Could you just talk about some of the mix impact in the quarter, whether its product or end market driven that got to that result?","Sherry Buck","Sure, any question we have a lot of pushes and pulls on the gross margin. So there as some positive mix dynamics and manufacturing variances were helped some of the cushions on it, we had a pretty strong service quarter and so as you know that\u2019s kind of a headwind to our gross margin but it helps us on the operating margin. Our US performance, with it being, it has been improved but now there is bigger part of the total that is also a little bit of a headwind on the gross margin. So, you put all those things together and with the FX that gets us to our gross margins for the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Steve [indiscernible] from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, thanks. First is just a couple of housekeeping items for Sherry and then I have one for Chris. Sherry, there are some new revenue recognition rules coming into play for next year to get a chance to take a look at those and then see if you have any sense whether they\u2019ll impact particularly on service any of the rev record counting? ","And then also for Sherry, it seems like currency for next year is probably going to be I don\u2019t know, maybe 3%, 4% positive to the bottom line, is that anywhere close to what you\u2019re thinking? And then again, I had one for Chris. ","Sherry Buck ","Sure, on the revenue recognition, our team has been doing quite a bit of work on that globally just to understand the impacts of it and while we aren\u2019t totally complete with everything our current assessment would be that we\u2019re not having material impact on our revenue line or the service contracts at this point in time. ","Your other housekeeping question about FX for next year. So, a little too early to be giving guidance for 2018, we will do that in January, but I would say looking at today\u2019s FX rates it would be just a slight positive tailwind, I wouldn\u2019t be thinking as high as 3 or 4% based on today\u2019s rates. But, too early to call obviously since we are not in 2018 yet. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks Sherry, and then Chris look we have covered a lot of details here in the Q&A, I\u2019d love to just kind of open it up to you and ask a real simple question, it's like over the next I don\u2019t know quarter a year, you can pick the time horizon, if you want investors thinking about one thing that you really excited about that\u2019s a driver of topline growth through Waters that you think people might under appreciate. What is that? And I\u2019ll let others step in here. Thanks. ","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, thanks for the question Steve and it\u2019s a good time to think about those things, we have just completed our second annual strategic planning process, we had a great discussion with our Board of Directors last week in New York. And one of the things that I have gained a deeper appreciation for I guess I have been on the job a little more than two years now, is just the opportunity out there, I think there is more opportunity in this business that I have been appreciated, when I first came in and that really is a function of sort of the inexorable desire of the world to gain even deeper insights into the molecular structure of material of all type whether its drugs, food or materials and I think as we look at our long range plans and we look at our technology roadmap, making our technology more accessible to more users and to really open up that opportunity not just in Pharma but in our other categories is a big opportunity. I\u2019d say at the very top of our list is something that I have mentioned in some previous settings, including your conference, which is just the rise in analytical rigor around bio-molecules and the opportunity to move LC plus Mass spec workflows into routine regulated applications and we have talked a little bit about our [indiscernible] program and there is lot behind that is well. ","But I think there is some things out there that could lay the foundation for sustainable growth for a long period of time. And as we put more specificity around workflows and applications and informatics for the other vertical markets, we think that this is a great market development opportunity overall and I think what I am most excited about as we really hold all the cards in this deck, we have a very strong position as you know in chemical separations in Mass spectrometry particularly the integrated use of Mass spectrometry of course precision chemistries and the informatics that makes it all work together and comply with regulation and compliance needs. ","And so, I know that\u2019s a bit of a long answer but that\u2019s the opportunity that\u2019s on my mind, and so it's up to us as the management team to be a very disciplined on how we continue to deliver strong results and growth but also balance that margin expansion with the investment in the business, to get after these opportunities. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question coming is from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Dan Arias","Good morning, thank you. Chris, within Mass spec, can you just put some color to your comments there. You came back to the expansion of the application base in MS. So, at this point you\u2019re seeing higher growth from routine testing or is it more of the discovery research segment? Just curious how the split looks by usage or is there in fact a difference?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah, it\u2019s a good question Dan and actually as I highlighted in the note, we\u2019ve been encouraged by our mass spec performance this year. We\u2019ve had a solid mass spec year both in the quarter and year-to-date and that strength is broad based. We are seeing I think the beginnings of what I alluded to there in the prior question about the movement of mass spec into the heart of product development and even working its way even further downstream in to QA QC. ","But discovery has been robust, but it's also been robust in the applied markets. Our tandem quad portfolio in particular with [indiscernible] TQSX and TQS Micro is shown its strength in the food and in some of the chemical application areas as well. So again, somewhat of an outside in view coming into the company, I really do see mass spec overtime playing out as a much more broadly utilized tool in more simple formats that go well beyond some of the research applications that its traditionally been known for. ","Dan Arias","Okay, helpful. And then if I just maybe could ask one more question on the setup within the customer class. If I just look at the coming quarter, the comp for biopharma is 6% I believe which is less than what it was this quarter. So, I mean if you just look ahead at 4Q, do you think you could finish the year a couple of points higher in biopharma or is 5 to 6% in line with what you\u2019ve done year-to-date still the way to think about it?","Christopher O'Connell","You know Dan I guess I just comment that what we always typically say which is we look at the long-term historical growth rate of the markets which we have very much been tracking at on sort of a rolling basis as we\u2019ve said. And we continue to strive for that and strive to overachieve it where we can. ","And obviously year-end dynamics will play into that and I think we continue to look at the business as a global business. We\u2019re cautious in the US at this point but cautiously optimistic we think and we\u2019re not assuming everything goes right in terms of our guidance and so we\u2019ll continue to take step by step but the main point is that we think the pharma market is healthy overall is a very attractive and increasingly attractive market looking forward. And so, we\u2019ll just continue to stay laser focused on it in getting the best we can.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open. ","Amanda Murphy","Alright, good morning. I actually had a similar question to Dan just in terms of the LCE side of the business. So obviously you\u2019ve talked about or just talked about growth in generics and how that\u2019s going to continue drive our results strength in biologics. So, I just is wondering if you could help us understand kind of how the mix looks like in the install base at this point so between the alliance platform and then some of the UPLC product kind of what does that look like and how has it changed, how do you expect it to change and kind of what\u2019s the contribution to growth from both sides at this point?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure on the LCE business Amanda, that\u2019s a good question and we continue to see pretty good balance actually between our HPLC and UPLC platforms and you know at this point in time alliance in HPLC is still bigger in terms of units, the new PLC and also don\u2019t forget the [indiscernible] system which is a hybrid system that can bridge those methods and so we have a pretty robust portfolio and we continue to develop enhancements to that platform alongside our informatics platform because it's really LC plus Optical detection plus empower chromatography data systems as an overall system solution that is really the offering in the marketplace that serves particularly that generic customer as well as a wide variety of other types of molecules and it's not just the LC component but its actually the system and that\u2019s why you hear us talking so much about more of a systems orientation and systems engineering and transformational engineering things we can do uniquely by pulling all those things together. ","Amanda Murphy ","Got it, okay and then I also another question on China. So, one of the other areas you talked about in the past as being a driver of growth is traditional medicine. I just was curious if you had any contacts around how big that market could be for you, is that, as you think about China is obviously growing quite well, but how much of that market is driving the growth at this point and again kind of thinking going forward?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. TCM is definitely a unique aspect of the China market, and it's hard to predict I think or get our arms around how big that could be but it\u2019s an important market and the data point that I always love to hear and see is that the Chinese population takes prescriptions in equal amounts for TCM type products as well as traditional medical therapies and yet the labeling requirements in the testing methods around TCMs are small but growing quickly and so there does seem to be a genuine interest on a part of the Chinese regulators to continue to enhance the labeling requirements and the testing requirements for TCMs and we think that\u2019s a long term tailwind, those are pretty niche applications now. But we definitely see TCM and I'd also throw in food and food testing alongside TCM as categories that are seeing increasing regulation within China. ","China, has been a great story for the Company, we have had a very strong year-to-date in last 12 months and quarter itself in China and the thing that continues to impress me about China is the balance and the breadth of that growth, China is actually less concentrated in pharma than a lot of other markets, its more concentrated in food and materials than other markets and even within pharma has a lot of diversity in terms of generics, innovator drugs and TCMs. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Patrick Donnelly","Great thanks. Chris, I think you guys aren\u2019t the best proxy for government academic market given your relatively small exposure but certainly saw some notable growth there. Can you maybe just kind of talk through where you saw particular areas of strength and then maybe just a focus on the U.S. what you saw with the lab budgets here? ","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, no actually Patrick you are exactly right, you said it well which is we\u2019re not a great proxy for that market, its roughly 10% of our revenue. It was definitely a good quarter overall and that built on the 5% we grew in the prior quarter and year-to-date though if you look at more the rolling period of year-to-date or last 12 months were in that low to mid-single digit type range which is again I think more characteristic of that market overall. ","As we pointed out before, the academic market is small for us and somewhat lumpy. So, we do get quarter-to-quarter variation and will continue to emphasize that because if the market goes down a bit or up a bit, we don\u2019t get overly exercised because we see a pretty steady drumbeat of that business over the rolling period. But in particular there just continues I think to be a very healthy appetite for investment in biomedical research and in the Omex and we\u2019re particularly pleased with our position in a lot of the metabolomics type work, assays and have particularly strength there and we have seen greater and greater interest from the research community on metabolomics and better understanding of microbiome and some of the related areas of biomedical research.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay, makes sense. And maybe just one more on pharma and obviously a few questions on that, but when you look at the last couple of quarters at 4 or 5% growth, when you look forward, do you see kind of pockets of growth opportunity that you feel can reaccelerate this market towards kind of the high single digit growth that you feel and I know you talked about the longer-term growth rate of 6%. I mean do you feel like we\u2019re kind of in the cycle where we\u2019re going to hang around there for a little while there?","Christopher O'Connell","I don\u2019t exactly know, I mean I think we feel good about the overall market right now as we\u2019ve said and you now we never get too far ahead of our tips if you will in terms of forecasting accelerated growth over historical trends but as you know we do get that from time-to-time from quarter-to-quarter and we\u2019ve had some years like that and we do think that the underlying trends in pharma give us that possibility of continuing to see better growth from time-to-time and to fairly safely rely on that through the long-term historical rates. So, it's pretty hard to predict when that happens but it has happened and ought to continue to happen from time-to-time that we get some acceleration. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment is from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your line is open. ","Puneet Souda","Hi Chris, thanks for taking my questions. A quick clarification on the GST, I just assume India has still 7 to 8% of the mix. So, if you look at the GST categories and changes from a tax perspective and the GST tax buckets, once they are accounted for is it a benefit to the customer or is it a negative for them and then if that market is still continuing to be largely alliance or some of them shifting to UPLC on the generic end?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah, thanks for the question and just to clarify couple of quick things. India is more in the 6 to 7% range of our mix versus 7% to 8% but that\u2019s a pretty small difference and yes, GST is actually a really important thing and its just [indiscernible] of India and a bull on India and the economy and the government of India really. I applaud the implementation of GST as well as measures like demonetization. I think what India is doing right now is putting in some changes to their economy that could pave the way for more stability going forward. ","The delay in orders and shipments is purely related to systems implementations for our customers to be compliant with the new laws and that our systems have to match up to their systems. So, as we work through that which we\u2019re working through real time, and our customers are working through that will provide certainly a very stable base of transactional capability going forward and I don\u2019t see it as any kind of an ongoing headwind, or in particular on a Q tailwind other than the catch that we will see. But really, I think it's another example of more of a long term foundational attribute of the Indian economy that will benefit the country overtime. ","Puneet Souda","Okay, thanks for that. And quickly on the Hurricane impact as well as just wanted to understand, are you expecting, are you accounting for any of the uptick and instrument replacement at some of these mass specs and LC that are largely sitting idle, I mean I ask that because some of us would been in mass specs, and essential detectors rule go bad overtime as they are sitting on the back end, so just trying to understand if there is any replacement tailwind coming from that in your guidance and expectations?","Christopher O'Connell","I think we\u2019re actually pretty conservative on that and we\u2019re not assuming any kind of accelerated replacement or tailwind there. I mean we\u2019re really focused on the needs of our employees and our customers, obviously we have employees in some of these ravaged areas Puerto Rico and beyond and our focus is really purely on getting people back up and running and helping our customers work through this and if that results in some additional opportunity down the road great, but we\u2019re not thinking opportunistically about it in that way, we\u2019re thinking more operationally about it and doing the best we can to serve our customers. ","So, I think we have time, for one or two quick ones here, John maybe two more please operator. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard ","Thanks. One quicker for Sherry, sort of housekeeping items. What was the revenue contribution from M&A in the third quarter, and just to confirm, you do have an extra day in the fourth quarter, correct?","Sherry Buck ","Yes, so just a very small contribution from M&A coming through TA as Chris mentioned in his earlier comments. And then there isn\u2019t extra day in the fourth quarter and we kind of fully factor that into our outlook and guidance. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Thanks Steven here. Just a quick one for Sherry and then a question for Chris. Sherry, just when I am looking, just want to make sure I have a little math right here on your third quarter results. I believe your guidance was for a 4% to 5% headwind from FX and then FX was a penny positive, do I have that right, so it's kind of a similar in a $0.07 to $0.09 positive swing for FX in the quarter. ","Sherry Buck ","Yes, that\u2019s correct. ","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And then Chris just wonder if you could comment all about kind of your product vitality in terms of what products are driving your growth these days whether its new products, kind of older products, how the QDA fits into that and any comments on kind of the overall new product pipeline?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, I won't give too precise of an answer on that, because it does move around quarter to quarter but actually -- we are balance really comes to our mind, I am impressed by the contribution of very old products if you will like Alliance, HPLC Systems with empower chromatography data. That continues to chug along and be a very reliable source of growth. We continue to see good uptick on what I will call sort of medium in the market products like UPLC and QD arc as well. Like I said mass specs have been really solid and that\u2019s been a combination of some technology that\u2019s been in the market for a few years like TQS Micro, QDA, but also the [indiscernible] which is about a year old. ","So, have a lot of balance, and we do have a pretty strong product cycle we believe coming up in \u201918 and beyond and we\u2019ll continue to try to leverage all aspects of this. One thing I do think about a lot of not just the launch of new technology but really how that technology grabs hold and gets traction in the marketplace and sometimes the biggest impact you actually see in a lot of these products and technology categories is actually in your two, three and four as some of those technologies work their way in to more standards of measurement. ","So anyway, we think we have a pretty vibrant product offering and a good product position in this as I\u2019ve said today and many times R&D investment is our number one priority for growth for the future. ","So anyway, with that maybe we\u2019ll finish with the questions and just want to say thank you for the great questions from all of you. In conclusion, we\u2019re pleased with our results through the first three quarters of 2017, headlined by our ability to deliver consistently strong organic revenue growth combined with disciplined P&L management to deliver double digit earnings per share growth. As we close out 2017, we remain focused on execution and feel that market conditions combined with our strong competitive position support continued success. ","So, on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for our support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2017 call which we currently anticipate holding on January 23rd 2018. Thanks, and have a great day. ","Operator","Thank you.

If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Lynch - Waters Corp.","Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the second quarter and full year 2017.

In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with John Lynch, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. During today's call, I will provide an overview of our Q1 operating results as well as some broader commentary on our business. Sherry will then review financial details for our reported results and provide an update on our full-year 2017 financial outlook. And as always, we will conduct a robust Q&A session.","Jumping right into our operating results, I'm very pleased to report that our first quarter exceeded our expectations with continued strong sales growth from pharmaceutical markets augmented by a pickup in our industrial business. From a product perspective, we experienced balanced growth across our product categories including instrumentation, chemistries and service. Geographically, strong growth in Asia and Europe outweighed a slower start to the year in North America. Overall, the first quarter results revenues grew 6% even after the effect of two fewer days versus the prior period.","Looking at our P&L, disciplined spending and continued judicious use of capital resulted in growth in adjusted earnings per share of 9% before consideration of new stock compensation accounting rules and 16% after the change.","Taking a closer look and starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level. Sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 9% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical demand continues to be driven by macro trends of rising global regulatory standards, increasing worldwide patient access to medications, and growing volume of more demanding biologic drug testing. We continue to benefit from the evolving diversification towards generics and biologics in our pharmaceutical customer mix.","In the quarter, growth in biopharmaceutical markets was driven by large-molecule drug development applications in Europe and the Americas. Complementing this, growth from validated QC testing applications with a strong focus on data integrity significantly drove growth in China and India.","Sales to our worldwide industrial category, which includes the materials characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets, were strong in the first quarter, growing at 9%. This result continues the positive momentum that we saw in the closing months of 2016. The industrial category is driven by growing global needs to characterize material properties across a wide range of industries, as well as expanding food testing regulatory trends. While these end markets can experience variability quarter to quarter, we are encouraged by the improving market sentiment and believe we are well-positioned as a cyclical recovery in industrial markets appears to be underway.","Looking at our government and academic category, we saw sales decline by 11%. This follows solid mid-single digit growth we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2016. As we've discussed before, the government and academic category is a small percentage of our overall business and quarter-to-quarter growth can be highly variable given the nature of government and academic purchasing activity and the typically high selling prices of the advanced systems that we promote into this end market. Despite potential quarter-to-quarter variability, our expectations is for improvement as we move throughout the year.","Now, I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters' instrument sales grew 6% in the first quarter with solid contribution from both our LC and LC\/MS platforms. We saw strong growth from our ACQUITY Arc and workhorse Alliance-based systems which are primarily used for regulated testing applications.","Bench-top LC\/MS systems that incorporated our Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole mass spectrometers grew strongly in the quarter, particularly for biopharmaceutical applications. We also experienced continued solid growth from the ACQUITY QDa which is setting the standard as customers take the opportunity to upgrade their large and growing LC base to mass detection.","Having now delivered thousands of QDa detectors for a broad range of applications, we are confident that our application expertise and industry-leading Empower software tailored to QDa methodologies affords Waters a distinct advantage in this high-potential product category.","Speaking of Empower, in March, Waters introduced Empower Cloud, a cloud deployable compliance-ready version of our chromatography data software. We have seen significant interest in this new embodiment of Empower, the gold standard for data integrity and operational efficiency for 25 years and counting.","As you are aware, recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, represent approximately 50% of our business. During the first quarter, we saw 6% growth in recurring revenues.","Turning to our TA product line. We are encouraged by first quarter performance as revenues for TA products and services grew by 7%. Instrument sales grew 11%, led by our new Discovery line of thermal analyzers introduced in 2016.","Also at this year's Pittsburgh conference, TA launched the Discovery SDT 650, a simultaneous differential scanning calorimeter and thermogravimetric analyzer, which delivers unprecedented sensitivity and versatility. Rheology products also performed well in the quarter with broad-based growth, including the acquired technology systems we have tailored for elastomer characterization.","Finally, I will review our performance by geography at the corporate level. As you know, we have a balanced geographic portfolio with Asia becoming a bigger part of our overall business. In the quarter, Asia continued to outpace the overall growth, led by strong double-digit sales growth in China and India. Within China, we saw impressive growth from pharma and industrial customers. Looking specifically at the pharma category, growth drivers included new regulatory requirements by China's Food and Drug Administration, which focus on consistency of results and the integrity of data in generic drug evaluations, as well as growth in active pharmaceutical ingredient production.","Japan sales were in line with our expectations of a Q1 decline against a difficult base of comparison, particularly amongst pharmaceutical customers that generated very strong demand for our products in the first quarter of 2016. Revenues in the Americas declined by 2% in the quarter, with our U.S. sales down 7%. The decline in the U.S. was most apparent in our small molecule pharma segment compared to strong double-digit growth in the prior year's quarter.","Trends within the quarter suggest that slower budgetary releases partially accounted for the weaker demand. We saw improvement later in the quarter, as well as the opening weeks of this month. We anticipate that our sales growth in the U.S. will improve throughout 2017 as we remain confident in the overall condition of the U.S. pharmaceutical and industrial markets.","Europe was a strong contributor to the first quarter, growing 9% overall. Strength in pharmaceutical end markets, accompanied by robust demand from industrial markets, offset weakness in government and academic markets. We saw broad-based demand from our pharmaceutical customers for both small and large molecule applications.","Demand from our industrial customers was strongest for materials characterization and chemical analysis. While we face a more difficult base of comparison in Europe as we move throughout the year, we are encouraged with the underlying demand dynamics and our operational execution in a complex environment.","Summarizing the state of our business after Q1 2017, our key growth drivers, including global pharma demand, Asia markets generally and the consistency of our recurring revenues, appear to be factors that will benefit our 2017 performance just as they did in 2016. Furthermore, we are encouraged that 2017 should present us with improving market dynamics within our industrial materials base of customers. Added together, 2017 is off to a good start.","Stepping back and looking at the bigger picture, I'm encouraged that our results continue to reinforce the key messages and growth themes that we outlined at our comprehensive Investor Day recently held in New York City. I'd like to thank everyone who attended or listened and take a brief moment now to recap the three key messages from the day that underscore our value creation model.","First, Waters is very well positioned in structurally attractive markets, headlined by leading and focused positions in the most demanding applications for pharmaceutical development and production, materials characterization and food testing.","Second, Waters is a truly global company, serving an increasing broad, diverse and global customer base. We are benefiting from strong and sustainable market trends, including growing patient access to medicines, increasing complexity of molecular structure in innovative drugs, rising measurement standards for high performance materials and increasing regulation around food safety and quality.","And third, Waters has a strong track record of delivering industry-leading organic growth driven by internal innovation, augmented by continuous operational improvement and ever judicious use of shareholder capital.","Investor Day was a positive experience for us and hopefully a valuable addition to our proactive investor relations program. We will continually strive to give you a comprehensive understanding of our company and ongoing insight into how our leadership team approaches the Waters business.","And with that, I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of first quarter financials. Sherry?","Sherry L. Buck - Waters Corp.","Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. We recorded net sales in the first quarter of $498 million, an increase of about 6% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 1%. This resulted in 5% reported sales growth.","Our growth was driven by strength in our largest markets. Both our pharmaceutical and industrial markets grew 9%, which was partially offset by an 11% decline in academic and government customers. Product line growth was balanced with total instrument sales growing at 7% and recurring revenues growth of 6%.","Recurring revenue sales were impacted by two fewer calendar days in the quarter which we estimate reduced recurring revenue sales by about 2% and overall revenue by about 1%. Breaking that down further, sales relating to Waters' branded products and services were up 6% while TAs grew 7%. Combined LC and LC\/MS instrument platform sales increased by 6% and TAs instrumentation system sales grew by 11%.","As Chris shared, we are encouraged by the strong start in TA Instruments as we saw benefits from new products and more positive industry dynamics. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew by 6%.","Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically and before currency translation, sales in the Americas were down 2% with growth at Latin America offset by a 7% decline in U.S. sales. European sales were up 9% with Western European sales growing double digits and Eastern European sales growing mid-single digits. Sales in Asia were up 13%, led by strong double-digit sales growth in China and India, which were partially offset by an 8% sales decline in Japan.","Now, I'd like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 57.6% as we had expected compared to 57.7% in the prior year's quarter. Positive mix dynamics were offset by currency headwinds.","Moving down the first quarter's P&L, operating expenses were up 6% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency translation reduced operating expense growth by 4% on a reported basis. These spending levels and timing were consistent with our first quarter plan and the seasonality of our business. We expect operating expense growth rates to moderate on a full year basis and grow at a rate lower than our top line.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate before the effects of the new stock compensation rule for the quarter was 14.7%. This is the result of a mix of our legal entity profits in the quarter and we expect our full-year tax rate to normalize.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $5 million, down slightly from prior year. Our average share count came in at 80.8 million shares or approximately 1.2 million shares lower than in the first quarter last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.","During the first quarter, we bought 540,000 shares of our common stock for $82 million. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the first quarter was up 16% to $1.46, in comparison to earnings of $1.26 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $1.31 versus $1.15 last year. Both our non-GAAP and GAAP earnings include a benefit of $0.09 resulting from the new stock compensation accounting rules.","Excluding the benefit of the new stock compensation accounting rules, earnings per share increased 9% on a non-GAAP basis and 6% on a GAAP basis. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $3 billion and debt totaled $1.9 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $1.1 billion. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items.","In the first quarter of 2017, free cash flow came in at $156 million after funding $18 million of capital. This represents a strong start to the year and the highest free cash flow quarter in our company's history.","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 84 days this quarter, which is comparable to Q1 of last year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $17 million in comparison to the prior quarter. This is in line with typical seasonal patterns.","As we look forward to the balance of the year, I'd like to share our full year 2017 guidance. Our outlook generally assumes continued global growth and demand from our pharmaceutical end markets, year-over-year growth in our industrial markets, and consistent growth in our recurring revenue. These dynamics, along with our first quarter performance, support a strong mid-single-digit, constant currency sales increase in 2017. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to reduce 2017 sales growth by about 2%.","Our outlook for gross margins for the year is consistent with our previous guidance in the range of 58.5% to 59%, as higher volume and manufacturing efficiency gains are expected to be offset by negative effects from foreign currency translation. Our plan for the full year is to continue managing operating expense growth at a rate that is less than our sales growth. Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $23 million.","Next, to provide as much transparency as possible, I'd like to share some insights on how the new stock compensation rule will affect our operating tax rate and guidance. The impact of the new accounting standard will reduce our current full year non-GAAP operating tax rate from about 14% to approximately 12%, which is approximately a 2% reduction.","Currently assumed in our full year earnings per share guidance is a $0.15 benefit from the decrease in our tax expense. This is comprised of the reported Q1 impact of $0.09 and an assumption of $0.02 in each of the remaining quarters of 2017. Quarter-to-quarter variation reflects the timing of actual stock option exercises and our stock price.","Our 2017 guidance regarding capital allocation assumes continuation of our share repurchase program through 2017 at a rate that will result in an average diluted 2017 share count of about 80 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2017 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within the range of $7.20 to $7.40.","Because of the number of moving parts since our last earnings call, I will summarize for you the three key items that have increased our full year guide range. Recall from our year-end 2016 earnings release, we provided a guidance range of $6.85 to $7.10. The first item impacting our full year earnings per share guidance is FX. At current rates, foreign currency is assumed to negatively affect full year earnings per share growth by approximately 3%, which is about 1% better than we assumed in our January 2017 earnings call.","Second, the updated guidance reflects our strong first quarter results and confidence in our assumptions for the balance of the year. And, third, as mentioned previously, we have assumed a $0.15 benefit to our full year earnings per share from the decrease in our tax expense due to the change in accounting for the tax benefit on stock compensation.","Looking at the second quarter of 2017, we expect strong mid-single digit constant currency sales growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce second quarter sales growth by about 3%. Combining these top line factors with a moderate increase in expenses and assume $0.02 of tax benefit due to the new accounting standard and approximately a 3% negative impact from currency translation at current rates, we estimate second quarter earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.65 to $1.75.","Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Chris. Chris?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Great. Thank you, Sherry. As we move through 2017, we will continue to emphasize execution in our core business and believe that trends in our key business drivers suggest a continuation of solid operating performance. As always, we'll strive for balance in our results and we'll seek to cover unexpected changes in our assumptions with the breadth of our growth opportunities. Additionally, as we have consistently stated, we will seek to balance growth, operating leverage and investment in the business.","With that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. May I have the first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Mr. Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was wondering if you can just comment on linearity in the quarter. It sounds like U.S. pharma improved exiting the quarter. So, maybe if you could just talk to the trends there, what your expectations are. And then, similarly on industrial, if you could just talk about linearity there throughout the quarter and how we think about the slope of the recovery heading into 2Q and the rest of the year?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Tycho. Yeah, let me just maybe put a little more color on the comment we made on pharma. We did get off to a slower start in the U.S. in pharma, and part of that reflects a very strong comparable from a year before. If you recall last year, U.S. pharma grew somewhere in the mid-teens. And so, when you normalize more of a stacked comp look, it didn't seem as severe, but we did notice relative sluggishness in budgets opening up in particularly large pharma companies in the U.S. And that did improve over the course of the quarter. And as I noted, as we look in the first few weeks of the second quarter that recovery pattern has continued.","Of course, all that's in context of a very strong pharma result worldwide, where we grew our pharma business 9%. And I think that just reflects the global nature of the business. We're less and less dependent on the U.S. We're more and more benefiting from some of the broader global trends. And even looking at Europe with very strong pharmaceutical performance, a lot of times, business does tradeoff between the U.S. and Europe for some of the global companies. So, it's hard to completely map all of that out. But we do put that U.S. pharma result in the right context, both as a comparison as well as to what's going on more broadly in the global picture.","Industrial is the second part of your question. And I would say the pattern was probably a little more stable in industrial overall. We had a great industrial quarter, as we pointed out with 9% growth worldwide. Again, that was led by Asia and Europe overall with sort of reasonable expectations in most geographies looking forward and this has been a big thing we've keyed on over the course of last year to see when this cyclical recovery may be occurring and it did definitely feel better across the board in Q1 than at many times over the prior year. But obviously, we're continuing to watch that closely.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then if I could ask one follow-up on academic, you recovered in 4Q after a difficult 3Q and then it was down again this quarter. Could you just get us comfortable that that's all kind of market demand issues as opposed to anything competitively?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","I think our experience in academic, and we've been through this a couple of quarters now in a row in this discussion, is exactly what we've said. It's a small business. It's in the low teens percentage of overall revenue. It's lumpy by its nature. It's not just lumpy overall, but it's lumpy geographically. We, for example, the U.S. government and academic business was actually very reasonable, and some of the softness was in Europe this quarter as I pointed out certainly overcome by very strong pharma and industrial demand in Europe. And so, it does move around quite a bit. We've not changed any of our models or expectations for that business on any rolling period. So, quarter-to-quarter variability in government and academic just doesn't surprise us one bit. We definitely look to long-term trends in that area.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Dan Arias from Citi. Your line is now open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah good morning. Thanks. Chris, just following up on industrial, if we just look at the rebound. Are you feeling like overall, it's fairly balanced in terms of U.S. versus Europe or does what you saw this quarter kind of make it seem like things are a bit farther along overseas for you guys. I guess, where are you seeing the most improvement?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Dan. As I alluded to, the stronger part of the industrial was in the international markets, and in Asia and in Europe, in particular, was better than the U.S., although we're certainly seeing green shoots in most markets around the world.","Clearly, the industrial business is made up of a couple of important components that we watch carefully. The food business, in particular, is one that we highlighted at Investor Day where we're seeing great stability of that business really all over the world. And then, we're seeing better performance in really more the materials side, as well as the industrial polymer side that crosses over both the TA and the Waters franchises.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, maybe on TA, do you feel like you saw kind of the full force of the Discovery launch this quarter? Are you expecting sales and placement activity to kind of ramp as we get closer to the middle of the year? Just kind of curious whether 1Q was a full-hit-the-ground-running quarter, so to speak, on that portfolio. Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks, Dan. That's a good question, and thanks for pointing out Discovery because that is a multiproduct family that is still very much coming to market. I noted the new combination, DSC\/TGA product that we launched, really, this quarter at Pittcon, so that's obviously very new. The first two launches last year are beginning to contribute.","The nature of new product launches in this field, of course, is that they do take time to get traction. So, no, I don't think actually we've seen the full benefit of the Discovery launch. Certainly, TA was a solid performance in Q1 and is benefiting from that technology. And as we've said in the past, we're looking for a recovery in the industrial markets and hopeful that our strong product position puts us in a good place to take advantage of that growth. And that's \u2013 I think we saw signs of that in Q1, and I think we still have a ways to go on that.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. My first question is on, I guess, generally speaking, the Americas. Overall, you were up against a favorable comparison in the U.S., but as you noted, this was not the case in the pharma end market. It sounds like Americas pharma was the key driver to the 2% core (30:23) revenue decline in the quarter. What was Q1 growth by end market in the Americas? Because it does sound like there must have been some offsets there. And were any end markets in the Americas notably impacted by uncertainty related to headlines coming out of Washington?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. So, thanks, Doug. Good morning. I guess the one clarification I want to make on U.S. pharma is that the place we saw the most pressure, as I noted, was in small molecule. We actually grew in the biologic category, and we're really seeing a lot of good signs in that market. We, as you know, at our Investor Day, pointed out our enthusiasm for the large molecule opportunity increasing. For example, the increasing uptick of LC-MS technology in regulated methods, not just in research methods. And so, some of those underlying trends are favorable and, like you suggest, provide puts and takes. It's very hard for me to say whether the uncertainty in the U.S. kind of political realm, if you will, is affecting markets. I mean, clearly, a lot of our major customers in both the pharmaceutical category and the industrial category, are paying close attention to evolving policy directions on tax and trade and healthcare and a variety of factors, and we do try to stay well attuned to that.","And it wouldn't surprise me if there is some hesitation in the U.S. right now generally, but again, it's our job to manage through that and we obviously, had great strength in Asia and Europe to offset that dynamic in the U.S. But nothing has really changed about our fundamental outlook for the U.S. and a lot of the things that we expect over the course of the year to develop in terms of our business we think are still very much there. So, first quarter, as you know, is a small quarter. It tends to move around in terms of the assumptions we make going into the year, but we do expect greater balance and stability as we get through the year.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's all helpful, Chris. Thank you for that. Just going back to the first part of the question, is it fair to say that given what we've talked about in terms of the U.S. pharma in the quarter and the fact that it rebounded late in the quarter into Q2, those are good signs. As we think about the other end markets within the Americas, is it fair to say that they actually did grow in the first quarter, just going through the math, it seems like that would be the case. Is that correct?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","I don't want to get too specific. Industrial was a little bit softer in the U.S. than it was in other parts of the world. And government and academic was actually reasonable in the U.S. So, it's a little bit of a mixed picture there.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And one last question. Going through the EPS bridge, Sherry, that was very helpful. Even going through that, it does seem like part of the driver has to be an assumption that top line growth is going to be a little bit stronger than what you had embedded into your guidance at the beginning of the year. Is that \u2013 and obviously, that flows through to the bottom line providing a component of the EPS guidance increase. Is that the case? And if so, is that largely attributable to what you're talking about in the industrial end market seeing some signs of improvement there?","Sherry L. Buck - Waters Corp.","Yeah. So, I'd say our guide range as we walk through that when we guided at the beginning of the year, we talked about mid-single digits growth. And I would say, with the performance we saw in the first quarter with our strong performance in both pharma and industrial, that's giving us a lot more confidence in the full year. And so, we're talking about a strong mid-single digits. And I'd say that's part of the flow through and the bridge for the earnings per share guidance.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks again for taking the questions.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from the line of Ms. Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Hello, Amanda? Maybe you're on mute, Amanda? Are you on the phone? Why don't we go to the next caller, then maybe we can pick up Amanda next?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Sir, your line is now open.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Chris, you mentioned the strengthening industrial business and it sounds as though quite a bit of that is coming from the TA business but also from the Waters and with some contribution from the new Discovery platform. But you mentioned that there was stability in the food safety market. Was food a bit softer than what you've seen over the last year or was that actually also growing strongly in the quarter?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","No. We had a good food quarter. Food has been a very consistent contributor. The applied markets there continue to be buoyed by some of the factors we talked about in depth at our investor conference in terms of rising regulation particularly in Asia, increasing consumer demand for quality and purity in food supply and, frankly, an up-tiering of technology in a lot of those methods particularly in the research labs.","We definitely had strength across the core LC-MS workflows, particularly given our strong product position in the Xevo tandem quad. You'll recall last year, we launched the Xevo TQ-XS, and that complements the TQD and the TQ-S micro as probably the industry's strongest offering in that core tandem quad category for the applied workflows. And I think that's put us in a great position in food, and we've seen consistently strong performance there including this quarter.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And looking at the large molecule drug market, are you able to tell, based on the sales cycle, the conversations you've had with customers or the types of systems that those customers are making. Are you able to tell whether that is sustainable, given the current funding environment that they've encountered and whether those customers continue to have strong cash balances and the ability to continue making purchases regardless of whether there's any improvement in the capital-raising ability of these companies?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","It's a really good question. I think first of all, we've seen consistent demand in large molecule testing. And as I alluded to earlier, that core LC-MS product position that we have and the increasing adoption of LC-MS methods in the regulated testing in the development and even getting now into QA\/QC is a trend that I think belies some of the uncertain factors that you described.","The diversity of innovation in the biopharm sector, I think, supports this. It's not just the small sort of capital-dependent companies that are doing this work. Really, a large segment of the innovator drug approach overall in companies large and small and through all the contract players and other new models emerging are all providing for a fairly broad, really, company set doing this work that probably provides more sustainability than, maybe, we would've thought in the past.","So anyway, we watch it carefully. It's an important market. And while the smaller companies can be lumpier, there's a lot more market participation right now.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Amanda Murphy. Ma'am, your line is now open.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll try this again. Can you hear me this time?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yes, we can. Thanks, Amanda.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sorry. I promise I was not on mute. Anyway, I did have a question about the CFDA. So, that's something that you said for a number of quarters now. So, I just want to get a sense of kind of what parts of the business that's driving \u2013 I'm assuming that there's some instrumentation component there and recurring revenue. So, I just want to get a sense of that. And then, also, just thinking about how long you think that might be a driver, where we're at there in terms of whether there's adoption in the front of it or whether there will be continued contribution from that over time maybe on the recurring revenue?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. And so, just the first part, I want to make sure I heard you clearly. You said the CFDA, the China FDA, right?","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Exactly. Yeah.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. So, it's a good question, and we think we're right in the heart of that opportunity. And we talked about this quite a bit in the past, where the 13th Five Year Plan of China, which is now more transparent and understandable by many, is clearly driving increasing requirements for data security and regulated methods.","Obviously, there's a large process going on in China right now with the large population and increasing patient access to medications and a desire on the part of the Chinese government to have local Chinese companies supply the bulk of that business and, furthermore, look to the future where they can become multinationals in their own right.","And so, from a technology standpoint, yes, there is a lot of instrumentation being sold but, really, at the heart of what's happening is the Empower Networks that we're selling. We've long offered Empower software in local language within China, and we've got a team in China that has decades in experience with this particular software and the backbone for our overall infrastructure. In fact, I was just over in China a few weeks ago reviewing this exact question with the team directly and with key influencers in the market. I think we \u2013 it's hard to predict what cycles look like or how long various investment periods last.","But as that market gets bigger, it's our hope that this becomes a pretty robust and sustainable market opportunity. And obviously, following the \u2013 the period of time during which big installations go in for instrumentation in software, you have follow-on opportunities in the recurring revenues of chemistry and service that we have a long way to go to develop.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up to that one. So then, can you just remind us then, I know you've talked about Empower a lot. Just as that solution is adopted more and more what exactly that means from a P&L perspective? So \u2013 and obviously, you've got the benefit on revenue, but just can you remind us where \u2013 what that means for margins, et cetera?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. I mean, like we've talked about in the past, some of our applied technologies, if you will, like the chemistries and the service and the informatics carry very favorable financial characteristics in terms of growth in margin relative to our overall portfolio. And as we pointed out at our investor day, 60% of our revenue is accounted for by service and chemistry and informatics and that's a nice foundation for us to build on in terms of our unique P&L structure.","Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, guys. Thank you. I want to come back to the academic end markets. I know we've cut a lot of this data a couple of different ways, but I was hoping maybe if you could look at it from the standpoint of how academic did between developed markets and emerging markets. And I acknowledge you guys earlier said that the business is lumpy, but I just want to sort of parse out what's going on in emerging markets in the academic channel versus U.S., Europe, so to speak?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Isaac. And, again, like I said earlier, this is a smaller market and tends to be highly variable, and that's true overall but also by geography. As I alluded to, U.S. was actually a modest positive in the quarter where Europe was more of a decline, of course, offset by all the great pharmaceutical and industrial business.","The emerging markets business is, again, relatively small in proportion, and that's a little bit of a mixed picture. It's very, very small in say, in India and in China. We've seen good performance out of that on a reasonably consistent basis.","So, again, we don't want to cut it too finely just because I think we could maybe draw the wrong conclusions because things tend to bounce back and forth quarter-to-quarter. What I tend to look at on that government and academic business is what does the rolling trend look like. And I think if I look back at the rolling 12 months and what lies ahead, it does tend to smooth out over time. But for the full year, we definitely see opportunities based on our new product launches and look for more balance over that type of time period.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on HPLC, interested in attach rates for consumables there. You've obviously had a very strong position in your live technology leadership over the last \u2013 for many years. And I think in the last couple of quarters, we've seen one of your major competitors on the com side get acquired. So, you've got a little bit of shift in the competitive dynamics. Just wondering how you guys are managing through that and the extent which you see opportunity for improved attached rates. Would be interested in how you're seeking to do that. Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. Sure. I always see opportunity in attach rates. As you know, in HPLC, it's lower than it is in UPLC where our attach rates are 2X or more in UPLC, and that certainly relates to the high-performance nature of those chemistries and the more integrated workflows there where it's a little more plug and play in HPLC. And certainly, to the extent there's disruption in the market with competitors going through various changes, that presents us opportunity.","And so, we think our strength is our total package that we offer our customers, the consistency and reliability, and interoperability of our different system components. And we'll continue to key off of that. And we always do set objectives to try to improve those rates. So at this point, we're just continuing to push the performance benefits of our chemistries and think we have competitive advantage in this area.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks, Isaac.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I was wondering within biopharma in the Americas results, could you comment on the trends with CDMOs? And was that different than some of the purchasing from the small molecule customers during the quarter?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","The CDMO question is interesting. I don't really have the data to tell you whether specifically that customer category was where that fit in the spectrum. I don't want to get into that level of detail here, but clearly the CDMO is a rising trend on both the R&D side but also on the manufacturing side, and our sales for that segment have been pretty robust through various cycles. It's still a smaller portion of our business but a rising portion. CDMOs are way behind where CROs are in terms of the amount of outsourcing activity that they enjoy. But we see that continuing to rise as the larger pharma companies are increasingly looking at their models for flexibility. So, that's been a good segment for us. It was good in the quarter, but I don't want to put too fine a point on it.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more in the order book with industrial customers, how that trended in the quarter for both TA and then some of the non-TA products that go into that channel.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Sure. We don't really comment on orders between orders and sales. And we have a relatively good visibility into our pipeline through our bidding process and our order indications in our orders and so forth, and have confidence that our order picture is shaping up to support what we're trying to achieve on the sales side. So, I don't \u2013 I'd rather not give out order numbers other than to say that we had a good quarter of orders as well just like we had for sales.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks Jack.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, sir.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just really two clarifications. One is I would actually take the other side of Jack's question. Do you have any sense, Chris, that over the last couple of quarters that the developers of biopharmaceuticals have become any more or less inclined to in-source or outsource R&D or are they doing more in-sourcing today than they were a couple of quarters ago?","And then for Sherry, just a question on currency. Could you give us \u2013 sorry if I missed this \u2013 but could you give us the growth of operating expense items excluding currency in the quarter? And can you give us a sense for how currency will impact OpEx over the balance of the year? Thanks a bunch.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the questions. First of all, just on the in-source, outsource. It's a really good question and I try to get my handle on the same question. I think that a couple of quarters' perspective is probably too short of a window to really see any meaningful changes in that model. I guess if I look at it over more of a 12 or 24-month kind of period, I think the trend is unmistakable towards outsourcing, particularly in later-stage development and manufacturing.","And so, when I look at our business in that area, when I look at the success and the aggregation of some of the players in the CDMO market, that to me points to more and more uptake of those types of services, particularly as they have the ability to provide plug-and-play sort of comprehensive solutions to the pharma companies.","So, I wouldn't say that I've seen any change in that kind of broad trend in the last couple of quarters. But it is something that we watch closely because it's an important topic.","Sherry, you want to comment on FX?","Sherry L. Buck - Waters Corp.","Sure. I think your question was around the operating expenses in the quarter. And our operating expenses overall in the quarter were in line with our plan. And on a constant currency basis, they grew about 6% versus last year. And our plans for the full year are to monitor our expenses such that they grow at a rate less than our top line. And when you look at the FX impact in the operating expenses, it had a favorable impact, as you can see.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, sorry, currency impact on OpEx for the balance of the year or the year in total?","Sherry L. Buck - Waters Corp.","We had expected it to be favorable but declining throughout the quarter, as we see the currency particularly in the pound kind of turn based upon last year's FX rates.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a bunch.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. It's Luke in for Ross. I was just hoping you could break out what you expect for the end markets in your guidance for the year, just kind of how the trends have been changing within those markets?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. So you said, Luke, you're dialing in for Ross.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Yes.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Thanks for the question. Yeah. In the end markets, again, as I sort of alluded to in the script, we generally assume over a long-term outlook like over the course of the year that some of the quarter-to-quarter variability factors that you see in any given quarter just like you did in Q1, tend to smooth out. And so, we do probably expect even more balance over the course of the year. But really, the kind of strong poles in the tent that we will continue to rely on for our overall performance appear to be reasonably stable versus what we've been experiencing in terms of strong pharma, better industrial. Obviously, Asia leading the way with increasing balance in the developed markets and with a relatively conservative outlook for government and academic. And don't forget, in all that modeling, the stability of our recurring revenues that were, as Sherry pointed out, a little bit affected in the first quarter with the days, but certainly remain an important part of our overall growth story and give us that reliability.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great. And I guess, following up on Amanda's question on the China pharma market. I mean, it seems like the pharma piece has been growing gangbusters over the last two years almost for you guys. Can you just talk about how this portfolio differs than what your developed market portfolio is, and if you guys are starting to see any opportunities in that market to, I guess, play in areas where you don't play and would like to?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","That's a good question. Broadly, the portfolio is, obviously, pharma is our number business over there. But one of the differences in China is that our food business is actually our number two business in China. The food testing environment in China is really one of the sort of hot areas of focus globally. And some of the more innovative methods and more exacting methods of food testing really brought on by some of the challenges that China has had in the past are good opportunities and only growing bigger.","In terms of how pharma is different, I guess I would point out a couple of interesting things about the pharma market from my standpoint in China. Number one is, there's a \u2013 it's a very large domestic market really geared towards generics as you might imagine as patient access to medications grows, but a market that's trying to emulate the regulatory standards of other markets. So, if you look at the Chinese pharmacopoeia, they're really reading right on the U.S. and other developed market pharmacopoeias for their method development.","Another difference in China is that there is a large and growing opportunity in traditional Chinese medicines. The Chinese consumer spends just as much money on traditional Chinese medicines as they spend on regular pharmaceutical drugs and, yet, the testing requirements have a long way to go to catch up. And there is a concerted effort on the part of the government and the Chinese pharmacopoeia to introduce more and more regulated methods for quality and purity and even health benefit of traditional Chinese medicines.","And so, there are definitely some differences there and, of course, there is an innovator segment as well. There's a lot of companies that are starting out in China that have more global ambitions to compete on a worldwide basis on innovative drugs. So, it's a pretty diverse opportunity there, really.","Luke Sergott - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Maybe we have time for a few more questions, maybe two or three questions. Try and go quickly here at the end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you squeezing me in. Sherry, just one for you. Were there any timing benefits to the cash flow in the first quarter, be it cash tax payments or otherwise?","And then, secondly, are the discrete facility expansions behind you at this point? And if so, should we expect to see the free cash flow conversion remain at an elevated level?","Sherry L. Buck - Waters Corp.","Yeah. So, thanks for that question. So, from the cash flow question, there weren't any unusual timing items. I'd say it's really an impact of our strong results for the quarter, the top line and the earnings that we have there.","I'd say on the CapEx question, we are through most of all the big facility expansion that we had here at our Milford headquarters and I'd say we should look at kind of just normalization rates when you back that out on our full year.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I know \u2013 I've heard you \u2013 what you said about your expectations for end-markets for the rest of the year and I know you're not calling out orders quantitatively. Would you be able to comment qualitatively on your confidence that pharma growth can be sustained, industrial is going to continue to improve, and I think you also mentioned some expectation for improvement in the government and academic end market. Do you feel like you have good visibility to those factors?","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Tim. I don't want to say too much than I said earlier other than to reinforce that our order trends are a positive. We have watched order trends carefully in Q1 and we want to get a jumpstart on the year from a backlog perspective, and we were able to achieve our goals from the standpoint of our order book. And it's not an order book that we can look out with great certainty, say, two or three quarters out but all of the indications early in the year are that the order book is a positive relative to what we're trying to achieve.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Maybe a last question. One more.","Operator","Certainly, sir. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Derik de Bruin from Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, just a couple of quick questions. So, Sherry, when we think about the 12% tax rate guide for this year, is that something we should think about for 2018 barring any changes from Washington on corporate tax reform?","And then just a couple of questions. Japan, I would have thought it would have been a little bit stronger this quarter given it's the end of the Japanese fiscal year. And just \u2013 people are asking about CDMOs, can we get \u2013 can I squeeze in one on the clinical contract research organizations. Did you see any sort of changes there? Thanks.","Sherry L. Buck - Waters Corp.","Yeah. I'll take the first one on the tax rate. So, yes, I think your comment of barring anything coming out of Washington, we would expect that kind of a tax rate, that \u2013 before the stock option, it was about 14%. With the stock option expense rules and benefiting us, about 15% this year, I think that 12% is a good rate for this year and for 2018 barring any changes from the government.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Derik. And just real quickly on Japan. As I said in the script, we had a very tough comparison year-over-year. One thing's interesting about Japan \u2013 and I actually just got back from Japan as well. Japan, a lot of the government purchasing, their final quarter is actually our first quarter. So, Q1 in Japan feels more like a Q4. And we had a huge comparison from a year ago, so we actually planned that type of a decline in the business, and the business met our expectations of what they delivered. And we're comfortable with the full year that we have shaping up for Japan. As you know, it's a very established mature business, very high rate of recurring revenue. We've got a very strong proven organization over there. And so, while it was not a grower in the quarter, it was about what we expected.","As it relates to CROs, they're a relatively small component of our spend. But certainly in the bioanalysis area, we are seeing positive trends from what I talked about earlier, which is the strength in our Tandem Quad portfolio; really seeing some encouraging wins in that segment now that we have the Xevo TQ-XS to complement to TQD and TQ-S micro. So, we like our product position there, and even though it's a small segment, we're encouraged by our performance.","Christopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.","So, thanks for the question. And I know we're coming up on time, so I want to thank everybody for the great questions, as always. And just to conclude, we are encouraged by our start to 2017, which is really headlined by our ability to deliver strong, organic top-line growth, some operating leverage and double-digit earnings per share growth. So, as we move into the mid part of 2017, we remain focused on delivering strong results and feel that market conditions and our strong competitive positions support continuing success.","So, on behalf of the entire management team at Waters, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q2 call, which we currently anticipate holding on July 25, 2017. Thank you, all, very much and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter 2014 financial results conference call. With me on today's call is Gene Cassis, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Treasurer and Investor Relations. As is our normal practice, I'll start with an overview of the quarter's business dynamics. Gene will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like Gene to cover the cautionary language.","Gene Cassis","Thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events and for the future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results for the company. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions, and that our actual results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from our present expectations, please see 10-K included with our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. Specifically, examine Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors. Also, see the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and Form 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is planned for July 2014.","During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release that we issued this morning. In our discussions of results and operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials. This schedule is included in this morning's press release.","Doug?","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you, Gene. Well, clearly our first quarter results was significantly weaker than what we had expected. The strong business momentum that we saw at the close of 2013 was encouraging for us as we entered this year. However, as we moved through March, we began to see our bookings forecast weaken as pharmaceutical capital budget release has slowed and as our sales opportunities in China and Latin America were adversely affected by ordering delays, primarily from governmentally-funded programs.","This weaker-than-expected topline performance combined with negative currency translation resulted in a decline in operating margins within the quarter. The year-over-year decline in our net profitability and adjusted earnings was also affected by an anticipated increase in our operating tax rate. As you might expect, we are most focused on the topline weakness as the currency and tax issues are likely to lessen in significance as we move through this year. Looking at the first quarter, our constant currency sales were flat with last year's and our adjusted earnings per share were down 14%.","For the Waters Division, our pharmaceutical end market sales were flat in the quarter due to delayed budgetary releases, mostly notably in the United States. Global government and academic business slowed in the quarter in comparison to last year's strong results in Europe and Asia. We anticipate government-funded research in the US to improve this year as funding levels have increased, as the business pipeline looks strong and as the first quarter's results were promising.","Geographically, weakness in Latin America and Canada and slower sales growth in China were below expectations for us in the quarter. In these markets, weaker-than-expected governmental spending adversely affected demand for our products. In China, we believe that the spending delays are temporary and that we will see a recovery in our sales growth. The business in China that we had anticipated booking and shipping in the first quarter is largely expected to be secured during 2014.","Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan were strong in the quarter and grew at a high single-digit rate. In comparison to last year's first quarter, sales growth benefited from healthy increases in governmental and academic spending. In addition, sales for our products to Japanese industrial chemical customers suggest improving economic activity for these exporting companies. First quarter's positive momentum appears to be continuing in the second quarter, the first quarter in Japan's fiscal year.","In the US, since staying in the Waters Division performance, sales was slightly down in the quarter in comparison to a mid single-digit increase in the 2013 quarter. Sales to pharmaceutical customers were flat in the quarter with budgetary delays and larger accounts offsetting stronger performance by smaller and specialty firms. Chemical analysis end markets in the US were also soft in the quarter and down from the prior year's more robust results. As I mentioned earlier, government and academic spending in the US was up in the first quarter and our pipeline for future sales is encouraging for our full year outlook.","In general, our developing markets in Latin America were under pressure in the quarter due primarily to weaker governmental funding for academic research and from weaker demand for food and environmental applications. As I mentioned in prior calls, business in these developing markets can be lumpy and a single quarter's outcome has historically not been a harbinger of future results.","Our European Waters Division business at constant currency was about flat in the first quarter. In contrast to the US, pharmaceutical sales were strong and up at a high single-digit rate, while government and academic spending was meaningfully down in comparison to a very strong 2013 performance.","Our TA Division started off 2014 with a mid single-digit decline in shipments following a strong 2013. After a slow January, orders began to build through the quarter and the division closed the quarter with year-over-year orders growth and the backlog build. Within the quarter, a significant investment was made to integrate newly acquired product lines into the TA portfolio and to train the worldwide sales and service organizations on these new technologies.","Geographically, Europe performed well in the quarter and enjoyed strong sales and orders growth. However, the division saw weakness in developing regions and the sales declined in the US. From a product perspective, rheology instruments had a strong quarter. Thermal systems saw a significant growth variability by region. And there was essentially no contribution from newly acquired product lines in the quarter. The outlook for TA for the second quarter and full year is for improvement across the division's product lines and regional markets. For the full year, TA expects to generate incremental sales growth from businesses acquired in 2013 and mid single-digit organic increases from core product offerings.","Now I'll talk about some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew 5% in the first quarter. Within the quarter, severe weather conditions, particularly in the US, and adverse impact on recurring revenue growth as restricted traveling conditions resulted in lower lab productivity. We believe underlying demand for chemistry and service offerings is marginally stronger than our first quarter sales growth may indicate.","On the chemistry front, ACQUITY UPLC columns after 10 years in the market now represent our largest column product line with broad penetration across research-focused end markets. Water service business was generally strong across all regions as the trend toward higher penetration for service maintenance contracts was apparent in the quarter's results.","Looking at our Waters Division instrument system sales and in contrast to the strong demand we saw late in 2013, UPLC MS system revenues were generally weaker than expected. For higher-end instruments, which incorporate advanced (inaudible) Q-Tof technology, the quarter's weaker performance was somewhat expected due to the particularly strong demand in the base quarter. We anticipate stronger sales growth from our SYNAPT and Xevo Q-Tof systems in subsequent quarters this year due to increased funding levels for government and academic research labs in the US. In addition, the release of capital budget to larger pharmaceutical accounts will benefit research instrument sales.","Of greater significance was the year-over-year decline in tandem quadrupole instrument sales. We believe that this weakness in the first quarter is larger attributed to lower demand for food analysis and environmental testing systems, especially in Asian, Latin American and European markets. At this year's Pittsburgh conference in March, we introduced a new iron source technology for our Xevo TQ-S tandem quadrupole systems. This new ion source called ionKey couples the demonstrated advantages of our StepWave technology with an integrated (inaudible)-based ACQUITY column separation to deliver improved sensitivity for challenging applications.","Initial customer demonstrations for this new technology has evidenced the competitive edge over more conventional source designs. Accordingly, we anticipate stronger high-end tandem quad system business as we go through 2014.","On the chromatography front, ACQUITY instrument system sales benefited from another strong quarter for our ACQUITY QDa mass detector. Demand for this compact mass detection technology, it has the potential to redefine the capability of research-focused liquid chromatography, exceeded the unit shipment volume in the fourth quarter of 2013. The primary application area for this new detection technology continued to be in the area of small molecule drug research. And in the first quarter, we saw drug research customers purchase the QDa as a detection module for existing UPLC or HPLC systems as well as within new system orders.","The demand that we saw in the first quarter is particularly encouraging, as we believe it represents a rather small proportion of the likely full year sales, given that many capital budgets were not released in the first quarter.","Now we can take a look at the second quarter and the full year. On the new product front, we expect that the positive momentum established for the past two quarters for the ACQUITY QDa will continue to build through the year. And in addition and based on positive customer feedback, we expect that our tandem quadrupole position will be strengthened by ionKey technology and meaningful new product launches planned at the ASMS Conference this June. And in addition, we are confident that our recurring revenues will continue to contribute profitable and stable growth throughout the year.","On the TA front, we will ship against the first quarter backlog and begin to meaningfully benefit from newly acquired product lines beginning the second quarter and through the year. If you look towards future M&A, we do see some encouraging opportunities to strengthen our technology portfolio and broaden our reach into medical research. I hope to provide you with more details later this year. In the meantime, it's likely that we'll see more M&A activity from our TA instruments division over the next few quarters, as we see more opportunity to continue with consistent and focused business acquisition plan here. As you know, a key deployment of our cash flow has been our share repurchase program and this will also continue in the future.","Before passing you on to Gene, I want to say that we anticipate delivering full year 2014 results that are improved over the first quarter's performance. We have an exciting set of new products to drive business growth, most notably our ACQUITY QDa and new system launches planned for this year's ASMS Conference. The medium and longer-term outlook for our businesses in China and in fact all of Asia continue to be promising. And our competitive positions in these areas are strong. Academic and government spending in the US are expected to improve as governmental agencies will be better funded in 2014 in comparison to the budgetary pressures that we saw in 2013.","I believe that 2014 will a successful for Waters, but I would have like to seen a stronger start than our first quarter's performance. Our new product flow is strong and we're well positioned in the most promising market segments. Organizationally, I feel we have fine-tuned our structure at the onset of this year to better address growth opportunities in a cost effective manner.","On the leadership transition front, we are steadily progressing to identify and position my successor in a manner that is sure as a smooth transition and the continuation of the core strategies that have accounted for our long-term success. I hope to share with you more information on developments in this area in upcoming communications. In the meantime, we will direct our operational efforts to securing the business that was not captured in the first quarter and we'll modulate our spending to provide a return to operational leverage and earnings growth.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Gene for a review of our financials.","Gene Cassis","Well, thank you, Doug, and good morning. Our first quarter revenues of $431 million were flat with last year, with currency translation neutral to sales. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were down 14% to $0.92 in comparison to earnings of $1.07 last year. This is primarily due to adverse currency effects and the higher operating tax rate. The tax rate for 2013 benefited from $3.5 million in US R&D tax credits. This opportunity is no longer available.","On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $0.82 versus $1.39 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that we issued this morning. The GAAP results in the first quarter of last year benefited from $31 million reduction in reserves of tax audits and the $3.5 million that I already mentioned in US R&D tax credits.","Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency effects, the United States sales were down 2%, Europe was up 2%, Japan was up 8% and sales of Asia outside of Japan were up 1%. Rest of world sales notably including Latin America were down against the strong performance in the prior year's quarter.","On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters Division, instrument system sales decreased by 5% and our recurring revenues were up by 5%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 1%. For our TA instruments division, constant currency sales including instruments and services decreased by 3%.","Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins came in at 56.4%, down from the first quarter of last year, largely due to foreign currency exchange dynamics. SG&A expenses were up 1% as a result of continued tight spending controls and cost reductions from the modest restructuring earlier in the quarter. R&D expenses decreased by 2% due to higher than normal project-related expenses in the 2013 quarter.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter came in as expected at 16%. This rate was meaningfully higher than in the first quarter of 2013 when we benefited from both the 2012 and 2013 R&D tax credits that I cited earlier. For full year 2014, we expect our operating tax rate to be between 15% and 16%.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and share count came in at 85.9 million shares or approximately 1.3 million shares lower than in the first quarter of last year. This is a result of our share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.85 billion and debt came in at $1.33 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of about $521 million. As for first quarter share repurchases, we bought 769,000 shares of our common stock for $86 million. This leaves 262 million remaining on our existing authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the first quarter of 2014, free cash came in at $108 million after funding $16 million worth of capital. Excluded from this amount is $6 million of investments associated with major facility expansion. On this front, we expect our new Wilmslow UK mass spectrometry center of excellence to be fully ready for occupancy and full utilization by mid this year.","Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 85 days this quarter, up five days from the first quarter of last year. This increase is primarily the result of the particular timing of overseas sales in the quarter and of not signified change in the long-term character or quality of our receivables. In the quarter, inventories increased by $31 million as we built instrument systems to accommodate a stronger than realized shipment volume and as a consequence of our plan to build safety stock during the transition of manufacturing at our new UK mass spectrometry facility.","Now I'd like to discuss our 2014 full year outlook. Clearly, we had a meaningful slower topline growth rate in the first quarter than what we had expected. We currently attribute this slow start largely to ordering delays and to a lesser extent shipping delays at our TA instruments division. In the upcoming quarters of 2014, we anticipate that positive new product momentum, the release of delayed capital budgets and the general improvement in our Asian businesses will allow us to recover most of the first quarter shortfall and to finish the year with the mid single-digit growth rate or similar to the constant currency growth rate that we delivered last year.","On the currency translation front, at current rates, we are estimating that for the full year, currency will approximately neutral to our sales growth or potentially slightly dilutive to operating margins. Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be around 59% and consistent with those for last year. Operating expenses are expected to be up moderately from 2013 levels or below our sales growth rate. Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million and we expect our full year operating tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%.","Turning to share count, our full year average diluted share count is now expected to be reduced to around 84.5 million shares outstanding. This is a result of our continued share repurchases. Rolling all of this together, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.50. As we think about our expectations for the second quarter of 2014, we anticipate organic sales growth to improve from our first quarter's results and come in at or above the mid single-digit range. Currency translation at today's rates would be about neutral to sales growth. This level of growth in combination with continued tight expense control is expected to result in non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $1.15 to $1.27 in the quarter.","Thank you. Doug?","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you, Gene. Operator, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is Brandon Couillard, Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","Gene, in terms of the provided outlook for the year, could you give us a breakdown of how you see that developing geographically and then by end market?","Gene Cassis","Generally for the full year outlook, it's pretty safe to look at our business in United States in our pharmaceutical business and assume that sort of the midpoint in our topline guidance is weighed around what our expectations are for that geography and for the pharmaceutical industry. Generally we anticipate that growth rate in Asia will be faster and we're a little bit more conservative on the full year growth rate in Europe. We started the year off pretty strong in Japan where we see positive signs coming into this quarter. So we're expecting that the Japanese rate may come in above the mean or maybe slightly below.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies","And then in terms of the 2Q outlook seems to suggest that the snapback in the organic growth rate, was there something in the order book late in the quarter that gives you the confidence in that rebound sequentially? Any color you can give us in terms of the backlog for the period would be helpful. And then the EPS range implies a slightly wider band than is usual for Waters in terms of the $0.12 delta. Is there something unusual in that low and high-end range?","Gene Cassis","Yes, those are both good questions, Brandon. In terms of the backlog, the one thing that we cited already in Doug's commentary is that we did have positive growth for our TA instruments division, even though we reported slightly negative sales results. So we do have that backlog. We also want to point out that as you look at the base year comparison, for the full year, we had a relatively strong first and fourth quarters and the two middle quarters were relatively flat in terms of our instrumentation growth. There is a base of comparison benefit as we go from the first quarter to the second quarter.","Also, as you look at the range of EPS and you look at what the expectations are on the topline, I'd say that the bottom of the range makes very minimal assumptions on the level of snapback that we see from the first quarter, in that our original expectation were that our growth rate in the second and third quarter would be stronger than the fourth quarter. But based on what we're seeing in the market now, we do have reason to believe that a portion of the delays that we saw in the first quarter will in fact come in, in the second quarter. At the high end of the guidance in the second quarter, we were anticipating a more full recovery of the sales delays that we saw in the first quarter. So that's one of the reasons for the expanded delays is kind of encapsulated in that rationale.","Operator","Our next question is Doug Schenkel, Cowen.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen","Some of your peers have already talked about the delay of capital budgets in China. I don't think anyone has talked about delays in US pharma capital budget releases. Why do you think US pharma budget release delays would be more impactful for you? And I'm just wondering if at this point in Q2, you've seen some improvement in that dynamic specific to US pharma.","Douglas Berthiaume","Doug, I think a couple of reasons. Number one, in many of those comparables, our large pharma business is more significant to us than it is for a number of our competitors. And so a delay there is probably going to show up more significantly in our results than in some of the competitors. We talk about this delay and it's not a dynamic that we haven't seen before in terms of late releases of big pharma's capital. And it's something that seems more common than I'd like to believe. But if you look at the request for quotes, there's typical time of turning a quote into an order and particularly look at the non-competitive that is labs that are almost totally dedicated to Waters business versus anyone else. You can see that this quarter, that time delay stretched much longer than has been typical from quote rates to delivering the orders.","And obviously we've gone back at this since the quarter completed. We've queried those customers. We feel reasonably confident that as it affects us, these are delays and not lost business. Gene, do you want to add anything to that?","Gene Cassis","No, I think that's accurate. And you know what's interesting? We're seeing this continued trend of an increasing percentage of our pharmaceutical business moving towards more specialty pharmaceutical accounts, more on the buy-out side. And the top 15 accounts that at one point made up about 25% of our sales. That percentage continues to attenuate and it's now approaching closer to 10% of our sales.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen","And I guess one or two quick related questions. I guess in hindsight, looking back at Q4, I'm just wondering if you think some of that Q4 strength in a quarter that was really great and where you attributed a lot of that strength to essentially recapturing revenues that you didn't get earlier in 2013, now if there's any signs that maybe there were some revenue pull-forward out of Q1, was that a dynamic? I know you guys talked about having a lot of momentum heading into Q2 and further into the year. But I am wondering if maybe you think Q4 maybe benefited to some extent in hindsight at the expense of Q1.","Douglas Berthiaume","It's not impossible. I'd say if you look at where we continued to see strength in the fourth quarter, the strength that we saw in China was a continuation. We saw a minor slowdown of releases in the third quarter in China. And that all kind of came back robustly in the fourth. I don't think there was much pull-forward in China. I think what we're seeing this quarter is a new dynamic there. And the pharmaceutical business that we saw in the developed countries in the fourth quarter, it's just kind of so typical of what we see in a budget-less year where that momentum starts off slow and builds up through the end of the year.","The only thing I could say would be that our performance with the QDa was very strong in the fourth quarter. So there might have been a little bit of a disproportionate piece of business, because it hadn't been available for sale. But then you look at the QDa and the orders and shipments on the QDa were even strong in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter. So clearly, we ask ourselves many of the same questions, because we don't want to be diluted as we go forward. But we can't find too much significant evidence that the fourth quarter represented a big pull-out of the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question Amanda Murphy, William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair","I just had a question on the QDa. So you mentioned that some of the platforms were slow to people who already had a solution. I'm curious just can you give us a perspective on how many are buying from existing platforms versus how many are buying QDa as part of a new platform? Just trying to get a sense of how penetrated the existing opportunity is.","Gene Cassis","To the last point, I think we're still very much at the beginning in terms of looking at penetration rates. And we think that there's a tremendously large market for research-focused chromatographs that can benefit from this technology. When you take a look at the fourth quarter last year, we were somewhat surprised to see how many of the QDa technology modules were sold as part of a complete system package. There's about half of them in the quarter. And we saw that people had some money at the end of the year and they decided to invest in a complete system at a rate that was a little bit higher than what we anticipated.","If I look at this last quarter, two-thirds of the instruments that we sold in the first quarter were additions to existing chromatographic systems, which was much more in line with what we were envisioning last year. So although the unit volume was up in terms of modules shipped in the quarter, from a revenue point of view, the fourth quarter of 2013 was comparable to what we saw in the first quarter of 2014 and kind of consistent with the outlook that we had coming into this year that the QDa could contribute quite a point of growth for the whole company in full year 2014. And I'd also just add that in terms of the uptake of this technology continues to be most sought after by people doing small molecules work research.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair","And have you guys said how much of your LC install base you think might be candidates for a QDa and then also what the ASP differences are if you were to buy as an add-on versus as part of a broader system?","Gene Cassis","Generally speaking, we look at the install base of chromatographs, Waters and non-Waters, we think it's pretty evenly divided between those that are being used for research purposes and those that are being used for quality control compliance type purposes. And the key market in the short term for QDa technology is going to be on the research side. So there is a tremendously large install base of instruments that are using photodiode array technology. And the usage of that technology implies that the customer is interested in getting qualitative research or compound identification. So we think that this customer base, which might be a quarter to a third of the install base of chromatographs, is a great candidate for QDa technology.","Douglas Berthiaume","And in terms of looking at pricing for this technology, we're able to offer a complete system for less than $100,000, very comprehensive system. And we're able to offer an upgrade to an existing system for something less than $40,000. We think these price points are very attractive for the end markets.","Operator","Our next question is Jon Groberg, Macquarie.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","I'm just looking at your new guidance and if you look back over the last three years now, every year has something different, but kind of 2% EPS growth, 2% mid single-digit EPS growth this year. I'm just curious if anything that you're seeing in terms of newer challenges in the business. Maybe can you talk about how that is impacting, if it is impacting, the type of candidates that you're looking at to succeed you to run Waters?","Douglas Berthiaume","I think the answer is no, we think that the basic Waters strategy and the strength that we've seen over the years hasn't and shouldn't change. It's not like we believe that long-term opportunities in the high value-added technologies that we bring to market and has sustained our growth over the years has petered out. I think if you look at the last couple of years, I mean look at last year in particular, if the yen had stayed stable, our earnings would have grown double-digits or thereabout. So yeah, I do think it's possible to pull things in and out of any given year. But the focus that we have on developing new technologies and new products with this opportunity to selectively enhance our product portfolios in areas that directly related to what we do, we would currently focus more on TA than anywhere else. But the emerging medical applications and clinical diagnostic software, we think are some real opportunities for us. So I'd say we haven't changed the specs on what we're looking for and we haven't changed what we think the success of Waters long-term is likely to be.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","And, Doug, would you say in terms of the process, are you pleased with the candidates you're seeing? I know you're going to say you hope to update more in the future, but just kind of maybe you can give us a little bit more color on the process?","Douglas Berthiaume","I think the process has shown that there is a broad array of very interesting candidates who have shown real interest in the opportunity, Jon. I won't say that that surprises me. It's a great company with great technology and great opportunity, but it's nice to see that as you go out there that's reinforced by the response that we're getting from very qualified candidate.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","Obviously the gross margin I mean down to 56% was one of the weakest just going back over the year, it's a pretty weak number. Are you still expecting 59% for the year? Can you maybe just talk a little bit about why it was so weak in the first quarter and why your comps would be able to get back to a more normalized number for the year?","Gene Cassis","Yeah, the year-over-year comparison going from the first quarter of last year, Jon, to first quarter of this year, you need a little bit more detail to fully understand the dynamic there. The biggest thing is the currency impact on gross margin. So the lion's share of the difference that you see between last year's gross margin and the gross margin that we delivered in the first quarter is related to currency. And this includes the strong flow-through that we get in Japan, where last year for most of the first quarter, we're done with the yen that was at around 92 average (inaudible) this year.","Also on the currency, we had the pound movement in direction that was unfavorable to us. So it had the impact of increasing our cost of goods sold for product that sold to United Kingdom. So those are the big dynamics. Now superimposed on that, there is a natural progression of gross margin with volume, as you look at Waters over a one year period. So the reduced volume that we had in the first quarter combined with the typically lower volume that you get in the first quarter contributed to less absorption of fixed cost in the quarter and had negative impact on gross margins. So broadly speaking, it's that dynamic as well as the currency dynamic that caused the 56%-plus gross margin for Waters.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","But just so I'm clear, If the currency stayed where they are, the yen and the pound, how do you make it up in the next few quarters?","Gene Cassis","In fact, there is a big difference in the value of the yen as you move from the first quarter last year to the second quarter. So as you go and take a look at how the yen progressed across the year, you'll see that as we come into the second quarter, that'll be much more favorable. But pound, I made some commentary that foreign exchange might over the full year be a little bit dilutive. If the pound continues to strengthen, well, that can work against us. But as we go from the first quarter to the second quarter, implied in the guidance is a recovery in the growth of our instrumentation business and that will have a positive effect on our cost absorption.","Operator","Our next question is Paul Knight, Janney Capital Markets.","Paul Knight - Janney Capital Markets","Hi, Doug, I think on some of the same topic and that is operating margins were severely detrimental in the quarter. And is that due to in China when you sell the product, you're probably operating at a higher level of profitability than maybe other markets, or what are the dynamics going on that kind of cause that detrimental to occur?","Douglas Berthiaume","The margins we get around the world, they're remarkably consistent, certainly at the gross margin level. So the effect of the shortfall in China would be really no different than what we'd see from a shortfall in the United States. So if you look your way down P&L, the shortfall in earnings and clearly the shortfall in sales had a significant impact on us. So we were $17 million, $18 million shy of where we thought we were going to be for all the reasons that Gene talked about. Now at the same time, we under-spent SG&A, because we're careful and that's traditionally our bent.","So SG&A spending is clearly under control. But when you're flat at the topline, it's still tough to get any leverage out of that. So the real story on the profitability side was the gross margin line. And that's 2.5 points that Gene talked about largely affected by currency and the fact that we have such a shortfall on the instrumentation mix in this quarter. So we see ways for that to reverse itself as we go forward in 2014. We think that's a reasonable forecast. And if the currency behaves itself, it seems to be more or less with a little bit of question on the pound side, we think that recovers.","Paul Knight - Janney Capital Markets","With the completion of the UK facility, what portion of product is made in the UK now?","Douglas Berthiaume","If I take a look at our mass spectrometry center of excellence in Wilmslow, the high-end mass spectrometry that incorporate time of flight technology is primarily manufactured in United Kingdom. If I take a look at mass spectrometers that heavily utilize quadrupole technology, the lion's share of production is at our Wexford, Ireland facility. So most of this facility is not dedicated to manufacturing, Paul. We still are manufacturing more intensely in Ireland for our mass spec products. So it's really a focus on R&D, marketing and administration.","Operator","Next question is Dan Leonard with Leerink.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Justin on for Dan and thank you for the questions. Just was curious if you could elaborate on what you saw in China this quarter, maybe across product lines and some of the end markets and then maybe hone in on the change in kind of dynamics you saw there or alluded to in your prepared remarks.","Douglas Berthiaume","I think that surprised us versus our original expectations is the fact that the incoming quote rates and the desires on the part of customers is still very robust, still looks like kind of what we saw in typically in the last several years. As a matter of fact, the number of very large projects are with customers being very interested in talking to us about outfitting labs in a multiple instrument levels is going up. So the amount of grass roots level of interest, if anything, I think is growing. What we clearly saw was getting those quotes through the orders phase and then through the banking system to approve the shipment and then the payment of the orders, that all slowed in the first quarter. And that's kind of what we've spent a lot of time and researching the current status, why do we think that that's more or less a temporary dynamic. There's some risk that that issue will continue, but we don't think so. We think that we saw a little of this in the third quarter last year that then corrected itself in the fourth quarter. We're anticipating that our business for the year in China will be less than we originally forecasted, but that this significant slowdown will not repeat in the second quarter.","Gene, you have anything to add to that?","Gene Cassis","Just that if you look at our position in China historically, it's been a consistent year-over-year double-digit compounded average growth rate business for us. We don't see a very meaningful change in that long-term trajectory. But we also recognize that a significant portion of our business in China is funded by governmental agencies. So I guess that's a risk factor going forward as you begin to think about how governmental spending might have an impact on our business.","Unidentified Analyst","Can you talk a little bit about customer receptivity to the ionKey and then what kind of contribution to topline growth you're banking on this here from that product?","Douglas Berthiaume","Do you want to talk about the initial customer reaction?","Gene Cassis","Sure. The primary aspect of the ionKey is it's designed for applications where you're dealing with very small samples requiring very high sensitivity. Traditionally standard chromatographs were used, which in conjunction with mass spectrometer made for a fairly sophisticated and complex system with a lot of plumbing and tubing. The ionKey for the lack of a better term is almost a solid state chip-based system that really replicates the performance levels that you find with the ACQUITY-based type performance systems. So about two years prior to its introduction, we tested it roughly 25 major pharmaceutical houses with people doing high sensitivity regulated bio analysis. It probably had one of the most expensive free introduction evaluation that then got outstanding review.","So as we have rolled it into the marketplace, the receptiveness in a fairly narrow space, which again is low-volume high sensitivity applications, typically clinical type trials and so forth, is quite strong. Having said that, these systems are sold in a fairly high-end mass spectrometry based systems. And they're going into a market segment that is well established. The acceptance probably will take anywhere from six to 18 months for the early adopters now in the go to marketplace to pick up on this technology and find its advantages. So we think it has a fairly large audience in the pharmaceutical industry, but we also believe, because it's regulated and it will require a shift from traditional methods, it's not going to be an overnight transition. It will take a while. But we're very excited about the technology. The customers are excited. And we think that the future is very promising. And it will probably represent the direction of separations technology on the front end of these types of mass spec systems.","Operator","Our next question is Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","I just want to ask one on the pricing environment in general, maybe talk a little bit about what's embedded in your guidance this year and what you've seen year-to-date.","Douglas Berthiaume","I would say there's been no dramatic changes in the pricing environment. You always, Isaac, have some territory around the world that pops up out of the vacuum that all of a sudden the competitor seems to go on a rampage of offering special discounts. But those things happen in kind of very small areas. And we frankly don't see a broad dynamic of significant difficult price competition. It's a very competitive market. So we're always cognizant of what's going on. Certainly if you just look at China, for example, it wasn't that all of a sudden somebody started charging lower prices. We haven't seen those kinds of dynamics. It's more or less business as usual, as we've seen over the last several years.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","And then just a follow-up would be on your visibility in the drug industry. We're obviously facing a potentially unprecedented year in M&A there. And if you could just remind us, if we think about the cadence of spend from those customers, when you have M&A out there, is it the kind of thing where you have some sense of visibility on when the budget dollars get held up versus when they get released and spending comes back to normal, so to speak? And if so, how much of that's kind of discounted in your current guidance? I think this question might have been touched on earlier, but I was just hoping to tease out some more specifics relying on past precedent?","Douglas Berthiaume","First of all, I'd say in terms of a real merger, nothing is really underway. I mean you see the transactions going on between Glaxo and Novartis and restructuring those R&D programs. But that aside, certainly the Pfizer AstraZeneca, if it ever happened, wouldn't affect this year. And so on the largest front, I don't think you're likely to see those M&A activities affect 2014. To the extent that they do happen, I'd say we've seen both kinds of effects in the last, Christ, go back over 10 years. Some of those deals were aimed largely at sales force consolidation and back-office and G&A. And I'd say in many of those cases, you always see somewhat of a delay, but a pretty rapid return to a normal run rate of business.","In more recent years, we've seen more of a focus on R&D organizations and in fact have seen a more significant short-term effect on R&D procurement as they have consolidated R&D operations and significantly in some cases cut back. What we've clearly seen in our broad pharmaceutical marketplace is that the strength in the activity in the generic and the specialty pharma and biotech has made up for that slowdown in the consolidation of big pharma. But that's where I'd say you really have to look at the specifics of any transaction. And who knows if a US company really gets $100 million or more in tax benefits from doing this, maybe they'll have more money to spend on R&D.","Operator","Next question is Jeff Elliott, Robert W. Baird.","Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird","Can you talk a little bit more about the triple quad, what do you see in there? Is there a change in the competitive environment or what's going on?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, Gene can chime in here too. The triple quad market I'd say is one of the most competitive segments of the mass spectrometry market. It traditionally has been a marketplace where something happens with one product introduction and they kind of hold up a stronger position for a while. And then a competitor adjusts and comes back. And I'd say that happens almost year-by-year. No one gets knocked out of the box, but they have to respond to specific introductions. With us, I think you've seen us to some extent respond with things like ionKey and in terms of system configurations. But I do think it's fair to say that we've seen a number of competitors' introductions in the triple quad market in the past 09 to 12 months, and that probably had some effect on what's going on in the marketplace. And you'll see us respond over the next nine to 12 months with our own introductions, some included in ASMS. And I think this is just the market that we live in.","Gene Cassis","As we look at the tandem quadrupole market, we see the largest segment of that market being for regulated bio analysis. And based on the performance of our Xevo and Xevo TQ-S, over the past few years, we've made some inroads into a market that has historically been a tougher one for us. Over that time though, I think we've made very good penetration into the food safety testing and environmental segments. So we're disproportionately represented in our market mix towards these applied markets. And I'd say that as you look at these applied markets by quarter, it tends to be a lumpier business. As regulations come into place, you get a surge in business. And it feels good then, but then a year later, it's in the base. So I would say along with the dynamics that Doug pointed out that looking at what's changed year-over-year from us, it's just as not as robust a market for some of these applied market opportunities.","Operator","Tim Evans, Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities","Gene, I think you said at the earlier part of the call that you got basically no contribution from acquisition revenue, inorganic revenue in the quarter. But it looks at you spent like maybe about $45 million dollars on acquisitions since the middle of 2013. Can you comment there on what's going on? I don't think you're buying zero revenue company there, are you?","Gene Cassis","Well, if I take a look at the acquisitions that were made last year and look at those for the TA instruments group specifically, we made about four acquisitions. We did not get product revenue for those acquisitions within the TA instruments division. Now within the Waters Division, we also made acquisitions last year, but they were technology-based. So it was technology that's embedded primarily in our SYNAPT line of mass spectrometers. So it's a long-term with technology play rather than revenue stream that we acquire. So that's the reason why you're not seeing revenue associated with the Waters Division acquisition, because we really were not buying revenue, we were buying technology.","And on the TA side, we have devoted significant amount of time during the last quarter towards training the new organization and getting manufacturing processes for future growth this year. And I think you'll begin to see in the second quarter and beyond some nice contribution from the TA acquisition.","Douglas Berthiaume","Yeah, Tim, the TA acquisitions were largely done late in the year. And they were smaller organizations. In many cases, they're doing businesses through distributors. And so we decided as part of the transactions to take the time and renegotiations, we're doing direct. We had to renegotiate agreements in many cases and thought that it'd be much cleaner to not press these products through an old distribution channel, but to take our time and drive it out there later in the year. So that's why you're seeing a de minimis effect in the early part of the year. But these sales will grow significantly as we move through the year.","Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities","And can you just make a real quick comment on what you saw in the quarter?","Douglas Berthiaume","Yeah, our overall business in India was flat in the quarter, which is probably a little bit better than it was on average last year. And I still think we're seeing the effect of the regulatory issues in the generic drug manufacturers in India. And we're beginning to see the (inaudible) beginning to settle down. So we have optimism that as we get later in this year, we could see an improvement in our India business.","Operator","Our next question is Derik De Bruin.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I don't mean to harp on this, but I'm a little bit surprised that you're maintaining your organic revenue growth guidance of mid single-digits, given historically what's happened. I mean there has been purchasing delays, as people have looked (inaudible). And also in emerging markets, you're not as strong. Academic and government markets, they're not strong as they were in the past. Even the applied markets are slowing. I'm just a little bit curious as to why you still think that this time is different from what we've seen in the past. I'm still just a little bit flabbergasted.","Gene Cassis","I think as you begin to look at the mid single-digit growth rate assumption, here're some of the basis tenets that are beneath that. We think that market conditions are not drastically different from what we experienced last year. And last year, our constant currency growth rate was a little bit better than 5%. If I take a look at the components that drive our growth, we have roughly half of our business within the broad definition of recurring revenue. And historically, it's grown at a consistent mid single-digit or better rate. So if we think about the recurring revenues growing at a rate that's historically in line, you'd be looking at 5%, 6%, 7% growth rate, which brings about 3 points of growth to the corporation. So superimposed on that, we think that we have some opportunities this year with products like the QDa and with the TA acquisitions to ensure a certain level of instrumentation growth above the recurring revenue growth.","So when you begin to rip the business apart that way, you think about what the implications are for the core revenues for instruments. They're really not that dramatic to get you to the 5%-plus level. So that's the basic understanding that brought us to this position.","Douglas Berthiaume","I think, Derik, to be fair, if you look at one of the most significant shortcoming in the quarter, China was a big piece of it. And so if you look at the risk\/reward equation, we clearly think that the rest of the year in China isn't going to be a continuation of the first quarter. We think we have analyzed that to a level that we're not crazy in that assumption. In many ways, we're looking at significant projects that would even add to that enthusiasm. But they're not in hand yet. So we're not going to take them to the bank. But I would admit that China is a swing. If we're not right and China doesn't come back, but we don't think China can cut off forever their commitment to this technology. And so that's an important part of why we think the future is better than the first quarter.","Well, thank you, all, for hanging with us this quarter. It was clearly not the strongest quarter that we've had recently. And we hope to be talking to you on a more enthusiastic bent next quarter. So thanks again and we'll see you in the future. Bye, bye.","Operator","This does conclude the conference for today and all participants may disconnect at this time.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, Vice President of Investor Relations.","As is our normal practice, I'll start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, and John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the second quarter and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.","John A. Ornell","During the course of this conference call, we will be making various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q2 and full year 2013.

Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Well, 2013 has started off pretty much as we had anticipated. Our demand for new instrument system has improved nicely from the trends we saw throughout last year and has returned to organic growth rates with strong free cash generation that are more in line with our historical performance. Though our reported sales and earnings per share were lower than we had forecast, the shortfall was entirely due to currency translation dynamics, primarily the significant weakening we've seen in the Japanese yen.","Looking at the first quarter, our constant-currency sales grew about 5%. Our adjusted earnings per share were up 7%, and we generated strong free cash flow. John will review for you our financial performance in more detail momentarily.","For the Waters division, our pharmaceutical end markets grew organically at a mid-single digit rate with strong sales in India and China compensating for slower capital releases among large multinationals. Global government and academic demand accelerated to a high single-digit rate based largely on successful mass spectrometry technology driven line. Outside of life science markets, industrial chemical and applied markets grew more moderately in the quarter.","Geographically, the highlights in the quarter include a return to strong growth in India and the continued robustness of our business in China. The strength in China was broad based across the applications we addressed and looks to be sustainable in upcoming quarters. They're also expecting the strength in India to continue, as the local currency has stabilized and as production volumes for generic drugs ramp up and as CRO spending increases.","Waters division constant currency sales in Japan were modestly down in the quarter with nearly all customer categories exhibiting somewhat lackluster demand. This weak demand compounded the adverse effects of the weakened currency. We remain encouraged that sales growth will improve in Japan during the second half of 2013, as governmental stimulus programs kick in and as exporting manufacturing companies start investing due to potentially stronger profits as a result of the weaker yen.","In the U.S. and staying on the Waters division performance, sales were up mid-single digits. We saw our strongest growth in pharmaceutical and chemical analysis segments, while our government and academic spending were somewhat softer. The strength in pharma spending was largely from specialty clinical diagnostics and CRO customers. Spending from some of our larger pharmaceutical accounts shifted into the second quarter due to delays in capital budgets.","In general, our developing markets in Latin America performed pretty well in the first quarter in comparison to mixed results throughout 2012. Our European business in constant currency for the Waters division was about flat in the first quarter, essentially in line with our expectation.","Looking at customer groupings. European government and academic spending was robust in the quarter, while pharmaceutical and chemical analysis both saw modest decline. The academic strength was in part due to significant mass spectrometry placements for proteomics and metabolimics applications.","Our TA division started off 2013 with a solid mid-single-digit constant currency sales growth quarter. Growth was largely driven by new technology products with high-temperature instruments beginning to have a more meaningful impact in the division's overall sales performance. These high-temperature systems, instruments that are used to characterize metals and ceramics, are sourced from businesses that TA acquired during the past couple of years and will continue to expand TA's application rate for years to come. Geographically, growth for TA was largely balanced across major markets.","I now will discuss some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, only grew modestly in the first quarter, as both our chemistry and service businesses were adversely affected by roughly 2 fewer selling days in the quarter and by, in the case of our service revenues, a tough comparison to a double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2012.","Chemistry growth was a little weaker than we had anticipated even in light of the fewer selling days. However, ordering trends for columns and another chemical reagents have picked up early in the second quarter, and we anticipate that growth rates will normalize towards historical mid-single-digit levels as we move through this year. ACQUITY columns continue to account for an increasing proportion of our overall column business, and this trend is consistent with a steady uptick in UPLC adoption rates.","Looking out at our Waters division instrument system sales. Sales growth was particularly strong for UPLC mass spec systems. All our major mass spec technology platforms, including QTof, tandem quadrupole and single quadrupole devices, grew at double-digit rates with strong uptake in pharmaceutical R&D application. This trend is very encouraging, as we can begin to see the couple -- the positive impact that our new UNIFI operating systems is having and driving advanced system offerings and enhancing our competitive position in the marketplace.","On the chromatography front, we saw the strongest growth in orders for ACQUITY H-Class and UPC2 technology systems. H-class benefited from strong uptake when sold along with single and tandem quadrupole detection technology, while UPC2 adoption rates continued to steadily improve across a wide array of applications.","In March at the Pittsburgh conference, customers were very excited to see a new advanced polymer characterization system called ACQUITY APC that we introduced at that venue. The ACQUITY APC system couples new size exclusion ACQUITY column chemistry with a tailored ACQUITY UPLC system that includes a new high-sensitivity refractive index detector. Developed in collaboration with researchers at Dow Chemical, this new system represents a long-awaited quantum step in analytical capability for researchers developing advanced polymer-based products. We expect to see sales growth impact from this system as volumes ramp up during the second half of the year.","On the HPLC front, we saw consistent demand for our Alliance system. Alliance continues to be the workhorse system for generic drug quality control applications, and its consistent performance over many years has created a loyal customer base, a base fairly unwilling to change their purchase patterns. In that light, we have recently updated our Alliance system to ensure our ability to continue to manufacture and support this system for a number of years. The updated Alliance system offers performance that allows for seamless method transfer from earlier Alliance systems while providing updated electronics and improved industrial design.","So what are the things in store for us going forward? Well, the simple answer is largely more of the same. In that, I mean stable top line growth, industry-leading profitability and cash flow, and a conservative capital allocation strategy.","On the product front, expect us to continue to leverage the convergence of UPLC and mass spec technologies to create advanced UNIFI-based application tailored system. You will see examples of this that at ASMS later this quarter, as well as significant new MS innovations.","On the M&A front, we'll continue to see smaller complementary technology opportunities that fit our profitability and growth characteristics. It is likely that we will see more activity on this front from our TA Instruments division over the next few quarters as more assets appear accessible.","I'm confident that 2013 will be a successful year for Waters and that we will return to top line growth that's closer to our historical average rate, significantly better than what we saw last year during an industry-wide slowdown. Though we are not seeing economic conditions that suggest a robust recovery in the near term, we sense stability in the market. This market stability, in combination with the high degree of confidence that I have in our competitive position and in our technologically-focused business strategy, gives me confidence that we can perform well this year.","Now here's John for a review of our financials and an update on our outlook.","John A. Ornell","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. First quarter sales grew by 5% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 3%, resulting in 2% overall sales growth. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 7% to $1.07 this quarter compared to earnings of $1 last year.","On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.39 this quarter versus $0.98 last year, and the reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning. Our GAAP results this quarter contain a onetime income tax benefit from an update of our reserves based on recent significant progress made towards closure in ongoing income tax examinations.","As I just mentioned, before foreign currency translation, sales were up about 5%. Looking at this growth geographically and again, before foreign exchange affects, sales within the United States were up 6%. Europe was up 1%. Japan was down 2%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 5%. ROW sales growth in the quarter was strong.","On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 8%, and recurring revenues increased by 3% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, total sales increased by 6% versus prior year.","Now I would like to comment on our Q1 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in about as expected at 59.4%, down modestly from Q1 last year. As described in our prior guidance, we expect a modest decline in gross margin percentage across the year versus prior year as a result of a weaker currency translation environment and from additional software amortization from the release of our UNIFI products. Additionally this quarter, growth accelerated for our QTof-based mass spectrometry products, resulting in a mix shift that slightly reduced gross margin percentage and added to organic sales growth.","SG&A expenses were up 1% as a result of currency translation and continued tight spending controls. R&D expenses increased by 8% this quarter.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for Q1 came in at 12.6%, which contributed about $0.055 to earnings benefit this -- to our results this quarter versus our prior expectation. Our tax rates to Q1 is lower than our anticipated full year tax rate because it includes the R&D tax credit for 2012 that was reinstated in early 2013. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be between 15% and 15.5%.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and share count came in at 87.2 million shares, 3 million lower than Q1 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase programs.","On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1,590,000,000, and debt totaled $1,233,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $357 million. As for Q1 share repurchases, we bought slightly over 1 million shares of our common stock for $95 million. This leaves $548 million remaining on our most recently authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.","For Q1, free cash flow came in at $113 million after funding $18 million of CapEx. Excluded from this CapEx amount is $12 million of spend associated with our new Manchester, U.K. mass spectrometry facility. We expect this facility to be ready for occupancy in 2014.","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 80 days this quarter, up 3 days from Q1 last year. And in the quarter, as is typical early in the year, inventories increased by $7 million.","Now thinking about the remainder of 2013.","We had slightly stronger organic sales growth to start the year, and current business conditions look to support a continuation of this mid-single-digit growth trend. On the currency translation front, there has been a general weakening of major foreign currencies versus the dollar, with the Japanese yen leading the way with more than 10% depreciation since the start of the year. Updating our guidance for current translation rates now results in a 2% headwind from currency translation for the full year.","Moving down the P&L. Gross margins are expected to be about 59.5%, a modest decline due largely to currency translation and software amortization dynamics I discussed earlier. Operating expenses are expected to be up around 3% from 2012. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, and we expect our full year operating tax rate to be between 15% and 15.5%. Our full year average diluted share count is likely to be around 85.5 million shares outstanding. Rolling all of this together, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. This is $0.15 below our guidance from January and reflects the adverse impact of foreign currency translation at today's exchange rates.","As we think about our expectations for the second quarter of 2013, we expect organic sales growth to continue to be in the mid single digits. Currency at today's rates would reduce sales by about 2%, resulting in reported sales growth of about 3% to 4%. This brings non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23.","Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. I think, operator, at this point, we can open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken of ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So on -- it seemed like one of the stories for the quarter was sort of a recovery in instrument growth. And I know you had an easing comp there, but it seemed to be even better than most of us were looking for. And so if you sort of had to tease out, as obviously it seems like more broadly, CapEx demand is sort of soft, if you need to tease out sort of market growth, new instruments, maybe the benefit from India, sort of the different components of what sort of drove you better certainly than the market but even sort of better than forecasts, how would you sort of weigh that out amongst the different pieces?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, it's again, hard to totally characterize what's going in the market for one quarter, Ross, but I think the significant dynamics for us was a quite strong mass spec business were pretty much all over. So we saw good strong results across every mass spec platform: the tandems, the high-end SYNAPT, QTof line and the single quads. We also saw a return to growth in India. Now it's been a while coming, but we finally saw a return to significant growth in India, and we've seen a continuation of very strong business conditions in China, and our results there are probably stronger than most. The U.S. held up pretty well in the quarter, and Western Europe was soft but not softer than we had anticipated. So I think that all rolled up into a stronger capital position than certainly we've seen through most of 2012.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And on the margin line, it seems like all of the sort of issue you've had on pull-through is sort of currency related. I mean, I know it's hard to react to sort of short-term changes, but it seems like given the commentary, particularly on Japan, we're going to be in for a period of weak yen now for a while. I mean, is there anything you can do to sort of mitigate that? I know you don't have a lot of cost base in that region, and I'm not suggesting hedging. But on a medium-term basis, do you think about sort of shift [indiscernible] the region? Or is there anything you could do to basically offset some of that? Or we'll just have to live with the incrementals for the year as long as the yen is weak?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, our forecast anticipates that we live with it for the year. within Japan, it should be noted, our Japanese business is a very profitable business. So even at JPY 100, this business continues to operate very profitability for us, just not as profitable as it was, of course, at JPY 80. And we don't do any manufacturing in Japan, and we don't intend to. So all of our revenues in Japan, except for the locally-sourced service and administrative costs, are exposed to the yen. That's why the flow-through to our bottom line is so significant coming out of Japan. Whereas in Europe, we do a lot of manufacturing in Manchester and in Ireland. So we mitigate the -- we're more balanced in terms of our costs and revenues in Europe. So what we could see is if the stronger organic revenue continues for the year, it's conceivable that, that will be higher than our current forecast, and that might lead to a mitigation of the yen situation. But we have no intention of now locking in the yen at JPY 100. We're much better, over the long term, managing in this currency environment, and we'll modify our long-term budget and strategic plans. But within a year, it's very difficult to offset this kind of currency move.","Operator","Our next question is from Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to start with some customer -- kind of deeper dive. Starting with large pharma, Doug and John, maybe can you comment on how much of a drag the slower release of budgets in the first quarter was on your business and kind of what did large pharma grow in the quarter and how you're thinking about kind of full year growth from that customer base?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. I -- just thinking qualitative terms, Dan, it's a combination of what we think of slow budgets and maybe a little calendar effect. It was an unfortunate timing of Good Friday, and we clearly saw some large orders from big pharma that we thought would be in the -- late in the quarter that we've subsequently seen flip into the second quarter of the year. So we have specific evidence of that, and we have what we think of as being a somewhat encouraging qualitative feedback from many of our large pharma customers concerning their plans. And in fact, early on, we've seen some of that materialize. So there's some evidence of it. We're not taking it all to the bank. But we think the combination of those dynamics probably means that the first quarter, maybe the rest of the year is a bit stronger in that environment than we saw in the first quarter. John, do you want to comment at all about large pharma?","John A. Ornell","Yes. I would just say that generally speaking, pharma all in grew mid single digits. It did well, and that's in spite of a drag that we're talking about with large pharma. So I think most of that, as Doug said, is really just a lag in the release. As we said, we had a very good start to the second quarter with that group of customers, so it doesn't appear to be a full year dynamic.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe just kind of sticking with the customers. Could you kind of update us on how you're thinking about academic, government, industrial kind of growth throughout the year? I mean, certainly I get that academic and government you said grew high single this quarter and industrial sounds like it was -- kind of maybe grew modestly. How are you thinking about the remainder unit for those 2 customer bases?","John A. Ornell","Yes. I think on the government, academic side, the good news is, is that we have a pretty diverse worldwide clientele of customers. The U.S. wasn't certainly as robust as our customer base in Asia, for example. So all in, we had a really good year or a good start to the year with government, academic. A significant shipment of some high-end mass spectrometry products within Europe to some of those customers as well helped. So I would say, we're certainly above where we thought we'd be for one quarter. Maybe instead of a flat for this group customers, there's a modest amount of growth as we make our way through the year. But we're certainly off to a good start and better than we would have said as we entered the year. On the industrial side, I would say that we're not meaningfully off of our original expectation. That still grew at kind of at 3%, 4%, so it wasn't as low as you might think. We're pretty optimistic as we look at the product offerings that we have, the new APC, the TA Instruments offerings that will extract our share of business from the group of customers as well. So I wouldn't say we're concerned about even the industrial chemical side of the business at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Knight of CLSA.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Doug, it's the most bullish you've been on having TA move on acquisitions. What's creating that level of, I guess, heightened interest on your part?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, Paul, a lot of it is that we keep looking hard there. I mean, we've got a confident, aggressive management team, and they kind of fit our mold of being in our sweet spot of revenues that range from $5 million to $20 million, businesses that can easily fit within the infrastructure of the TA division and probably a little more interest at this stage in the year on a number of these fronts than we've seen. So it may be making a little more progress. So I could be embarrassed, and by the end of the year, we might not have secured the fronts that I think we're working well on. Our forecast, of course, doesn't include any of this. But I feel better at this point in the year about making progress there than probably I have traditionally, Paul.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then lastly, I know NIH is a small part, but could you tell how that market was in the quarter and your projection of it?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think probably, like everybody, we think sequestration hurt a bit. The U.S. market in that -- in this area wasn't strong for us. But the timing of NIH type of procurement can also be a little hard to read. So it wasn't good, and we're anticipating that it's going to be on the soft side for the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen  and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My first question is does your Q2 guidance assume that you captured the revenue you missed out on in Q1 due to the delay in the release of capital budgets? And has a portion of that or maybe even a significant portion of that amount already been recorded?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, Doug, I think it's fair to say that we're optimistic that the second quarter returned some of those revenues that we anticipated in the first quarter. It would also be fair to say that our guidance tempers, to some extent, and doesn't necessarily include the fact that, that will stick for the full quarter. We're -- we like to be a little conservative on this front because it's not impossible that we see an end of the quarter flip from the second quarter into the third quarter also. So we try to draw a midline between those expectations. I think it means that we're more secure in this forecast, but it doesn't mean that we have necessarily included a large batch of those orders. I think of it as more...","John A. Ornell","Insurance.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, insurance than it is largely reflected in our forecast.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And if they were already booked, it would be more than insurance. Is that a fair observation?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. But again, there's no guarantee that some of the things that we then anticipate at the end of the quarter couldn't flip into the next quarter. So we're feeling good, but we're not going to totally take it to the bank yet.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one area of clear investor focus recently has been on the pacing of the quarter, specifically what happened in March based on some commentary from other companies. Anything notable or surprising? It doesn't seem like that was the case, but just to be clear, would you guys talk about whether you saw anything abnormal as a result of the sequester in March, and more broadly, in some of your cyclical end markets?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Doug, I'd say the only thing that the end of the quarter saw was the timing of Good Friday in our more religious areas of the world. It fell on the last day of the quarter, and we have some reasonably good evidence that, that, probably combined with capital releases in large pharma, swung some timing of orders into the early part of the second quarter. I'd say the only other quarterly dynamic that we're seeing reverse is this whole issue on the consumables side. We've seen a curious dynamic on the consumables side being a slow start to the year. This isn't the first time, but this was a more unusual dynamic where we saw a very soft consumables business, largely, throughout the first quarter, and that seems to have turned very rapidly in the second quarter. And that may be uncertainty on the part of some of these large customers. It could be inventory management. We think that that's a onetime quarterly dynamic and have some pretty good evidence that it's already started to turn. So that's the only, I'd say, calendar type of dynamic, as well as 1 to 2 fewer selling days in the first quarter on the consumables front.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last question, really, a good quarter from an operating standpoint, especially when you adjust for FX. That said, SG&A grew, I believe, less than 1% year-over-year on about 5% constant-currency revenue growth. And this was against a pretty favorable comp at the SG&A line and follows 3 quarters where SG&A spend declined about 3% to 4% relative to the previous year. How sustainable is this? I assume you get some natural hedge as a result of FX, but beyond that, can you maintain SG&A at these levels moving forward?","John A. Ornell","Yes. I think from a model perspective, Doug, we've got about a 3% growth all in for the remainder of the year, and there are certain areas of the world that are going to require some level of investment as sales growth is in the double digits in those regions. As we've always said, we hold back as we start the year in making those types of investments to be sure that we are comfortable with the trajectory that we see. So I think there'll be a modest lift in SG&A as we make our way through the next few quarters. They could be -- there's little flexibility in that, but I would say we've been somewhat stingy in releasing some amount of expense in some of these regions where it's needed, and you're going to see that creep up a little bit as we make our way through the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So one just maybe high-level one, you obviously were seeing some more consolidation taking place in the sector. You guys aren't small, but maybe smaller than some of your peers. And just any sort of updated views you might have there especially as you think about trying to expand into newer areas such as more than [indiscernible]...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm sorry, Vamil. Could you -- you faded at the end of that question. Could you repeat it, please?","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, sorry, just in terms of some of the consolidation that's taking place, if you have any updated views regarding the -- just your size relative to some of your peers, especially as you think about moving into some of the more clinical end markets. With some of your technologies, how do you see your position versus some of these bigger peers now?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Oh sure, it's probably a timely question. I think, clearly, you can look at maybe segregating business strategies in the life science tools area broadly into 2 categories. One group of companies who drive their strategy believing that they can get economies of scale and drive their business through acquiring like businesses and driving more business through their distribution organization versus companies kind of what I think clearly Waters is that focus on the needs of a smaller set of customers, with a smaller set of technologies and try to optimize that to benefit the customers and focus kind of exclusively in those areas of their expertise. Obviously, not a perfect cut between those, but I think you can characterize companies as falling in either one of those sets. I think the companies that are focused on the former, on the distribution side, are characterized by lower growth rates, lower growth in organic earnings and lower return on invested capitals than companies like us that have focused on the specific needs of the customers set, hone their business, manage their capital spending to a finer degree. Waters has competed, over the 30 years that I've been involved in the industry, most of the time, competing with larger companies that have multi-technology arms and arms that have competed with one another for capital. And we've come up pretty well on that score. So I don't think that there's a whole lot of evidence that suggests that there are unusual returns to scale in this industry. Granted, you have to be competing in a marketplace that's big enough to support your organization, but the chromatography in the mass spec markets are amongst the most sizable in our industry and offer continuing opportunities for us to provide our shareholders with above-average returns. So I guess that's how I'd answer it.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful to hear. And then just one other one. I know it's a little bit early in terms of ASMS coming up in a few weeks now. Any kind of insights you can provide regarding what we should expect? Is there anything you're looking at as big sort of pivotal meeting? Or is it more sort of incremental advances [indiscernible]?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think, at this point, we're not prepared to announce the ASMS. But we'd encourage you to go, and I think it's -- it will be a rewarding show.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Bhalla of Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Doug, on consumables, when you talked about the potential impacts that you saw in the quarter, you didn't discuss competition. Anything on the competitive front that could be impacting the consumables side?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We don't think so. It's a little bit of a head scratcher. And in that particular area, there's -- it's highly unlikely that a new product offering moves things very fast, and we certainly have not seen that. We think it's totally a combination of calendar dynamics and an unusual slowness in customer activity early on. In places like China, you could see unusual quarterly dynamics where they place their year-long chemistry orders in a lumpy pattern, and we certainly saw some of that during this quarter. So I don't think there's much of a competitive dynamic here, and I think the short amount of evidence that we've seen so far in the second quarter supports that assertion.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on China, I mean, robust performance overall. Can you give a little bit more detail by the end markets in terms of performance?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think the very encouraging thing about China is that it's broad based. It's across the traditional life science applications, as well as food quality, food safety and industrial applications. So boy, I'd say, if anything, we see the underlying dynamics in China strengthening a little bit rather than softening, and it's broad based.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And if I'd just sneak a quick one at the end, you mentioned in the prepared comments about Alliance and the stickiness there. As you continue to manufacture more Alliance system and demands there, what is the impact on pricing and gross margin for the business?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Nothing I said should lead you to believe that there's a significant pricing dynamic or gross margin dynamic. The new Alliance is largely an update of the old Alliance. It doesn't really significantly change the pricing of the margin dynamics.","Operator","Our next question is from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So Doug, if I look at -- just to make it clear, what are you assuming for your exchange rates now for the rest of the year? I think initially, you have the yen at JPY 86?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, we're assuming at current rates of JPY 99 now for the yen, and the others are just about where they were, the big difference being the fact that, obviously, the yen has depreciated meaningfully across the quarter.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Yes. So John, if I look at that, it looks like pretty much if I do that math given where you were and where it went to, it looks like pretty much all the EPS revision is driven by the new yen expectation, so you're basically not assuming better organic growth to offset any of that.","John A. Ornell","That's correct. I'd say right now, we're looking at a mid-single-digit growth expectation comparable with what we said in Q1. Yes, we did come in a little bit better to start the year. That's encouraging. We're talking about new products and opportunities that maybe makes that a little bit better, but I think it's just a little too early in the year to think about moving that number up at this point.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, I just wanted to be clear. And then on the R&D line, was there -- that group quite a bit obviously, as a percent of sales year-over-year, is there a -- is that just an anticipation as you were mentioning ASMS? Or is there anything in particular going on there?","John A. Ornell","Yes. It's virtually timing. We have a fair number of project-related expenses on that line, so a fixed base of labor, they're sizable, but the project spend can move that number up and down a few points a quarter. And in this quarter, we had a few new mass spec products that required some [indiscernible] units. And so the project expense timing of that was a little bit skewed towards the first quarter versus what you'll see for the rest of the year.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That growth rate moderates over the year, John.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Right. So your comment of the 3% was a total OpEx number, right?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Correct.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, Doug, this is for you. If you look over the last couple of your years, your net cash position has been building up quite a bit. Is there any reason that you can't be more aggressive there, do a larger buyback, get more to a net debt position? I know you mentioned some smaller acquisitions in TA, but I mean, maybe what's kind of the strategy there?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. Well, the net cash position, John, is largely driven by the offshore dynamics of our profitability, and so like a lot of technology companies, if we remit those earnings from offshore, then we're faced with a large U.S. tax burden. So our tendency is to keep those funds invested offshore. And to the extent that we don't generate enough local cash to support the buyback or our capital acquisitions, then the debt markets are more than adequate to support those needs. So it's a balance between those 2 that you see reflected in our balance sheet.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","But so is -- in U.S., are you kind of bouncing up against some of your covenants in terms of the U.S. cash flow that you're generating to -- in order to be able to borrow more or to do more of a buyback?","John A. Ornell","No, not at this point. We are careful to ensure that the pace of the buyback that we do year-by-year affords us enough headroom as the business grows to be able to continue that type of trajectory of share repurchase. So thinking that today, we might go out and do another $0.5 billion buyback one time and push up against the ceiling isn't something we want to do. The message we want to send is that we have a very consistent program that allows us the opportunity to spend $300 million, $350 million on a consistent basis each year and not bump up against those covenants. And you'll probably see us expand our revolver as the year goes on to ensure that we maintain headroom in that lending facility.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Security.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess one of the themes in 2012 was some pressure at the high end of the mass spec market. I'm certainly not getting that sense today. So has that eased? And if so, why?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We've definitely seen an improvement in our business at the high end of the mass spec marketplace. I think -- and we've seen it significantly in proteomics and metabonomics applications. It is coincidental with some technological improvements that we made in a number of those product lines which we have anecdotal support from our customer base concerning the benefit of those changes. So I think it's a little bit better marketplace, a better product offering that we've seen. It also comes together with the fact that the entire mass spec product line is operating very strongly right now. So it is noticeable. I do think it is a point -- we saw beginning of this in the fourth quarter and a strong continuation as we go into 2013.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just one other quick -- real quick, the -- you talked about your expectation for stability and the continuation of the positive trends that you've seen in Q1 from the organic growth side. That seems a little bit different than some of the macro data points. We're getting some weaker PMI numbers in even this morning. When you talk about the stability, what are you looking at? Are you looking at orders in hand? Or are you looking at macro variables?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We're looking at a combination of all those, Tim. I mean, we're looking at the -- a rolling average of our run rates in areas that have been indicative of the future. We're looking at our major geographies and looking at kind of what we call the drop sheets of customers that have asked for quotes, asked for early order indications, indicated interest in our new technologies. And in our biggest geographies, with the U.S. operating a little bit on the positive side, China operating on the very positive side, India returning for -- off of a period of very low growth with the opportunity to see pent-up replacement demand, I think traditionally, the overall GDP numbers in our areas don't correlate terribly well with Waters' individual growth dynamics. Obviously, we're not immune from economic activities we saw in 2009. But if you'd cast out those outliers, our individual markets are a better indicator than the overall GDP numbers. And we continue to be reasonably optimistic about what we're seeing in our individual markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First off, on x U.S. markets, wondering if you could maybe elaborate on Japan and India. In Japan, just wondering how you're looking at the impact of potential stimulus opportunities there as we move into the second and third quarters. And then in India, can you maybe quantify the magnitude of improvement that you saw this quarter? How much of that was easy comps versus just an underlying improvement in the demand picture?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think the India question, Isaac, is you can't ignore the fact that we didn't have a great year or quarter last year. So we did a little bit better than 2 years ago if you want to put it that way, but I wouldn't say that you're on a robust growth dynamic compared to 2 years ago. But it's still good off a baseline. We still think that there is some pent-up replacement demand in India, and we're encouraged about what those customers are saying, given the current state of the rupee and given the current state of regulatory hurdles in India. So we think that this kind of high teens kind of growth rate level for India looks sustainable. It in no way kind of is a quantum leap off 2 years ago, but it's good to see growth in that environment. The Japanese -- I -- we agree with you that we think stimulus spending can improve the situation in Japan as we go through the year. The stimulus amounts are very clearly aimed partly at customers in our segment. So we think our forecast accounts for a little of that, but we're not going to take it all to the bank until we start seeing those orders begin to roll in.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's very helpful. And then just on TA, one more question there regarding your comments on M&A opportunities. You said that there are more assets available. I'm just wondering why that's the case now. I would think that competition is higher just given the low cost of debt and the lack of growth that a lot of companies are seeing, so just wondering if you think it's an issue where you're more willing to deploy capital there given your cash generation in your balance sheet. Or is the situation where you're seeing more willing sellers for some company-specific reasons?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think it's probably more that just we've been so active in that area, and in our world, there are more opportunity -- more niche opportunities in that physical properties segment of the marketplace. Whereas in chromatography mass spec arena, there are much larger companies who are more established. And I think in some of these cases, you're looking at companies that are run by older management teams who are ready to perhaps move along. It's a -- it's not a homogenous set of companies that we're looking at. There are different dynamics driving a number of them. So it's hard to characterize them with a broad brush.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was just hoping to get a better idea of how the weaker yen impacts profitability, and my question's a 2-part one. You mentioned that Japan is still very profitable at $100 yen (sic) [JPY 100] . I'm wondering if it's still above the corporate average of JPY 100? And if that's the case, when does it fall below? Is it JPY 105? Is it JPY 110? And then secondly, is it correct to assume that the lion's share of your year-over-year gross margin decline in the quarter, that the lion's share of that was yen as opposed to the software amortization?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","John, you want to start on that?","John A. Ornell","Sure. The Japanese business, even back at JPY 115, was a very profitable business and not a meaningful drag even at that level on the business. So it's the change year-over-year that gets our attention. But when you look at the absolute dollars of profit coming from that business at JPY 100 translation, it's still a very profitable business.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","It probably has to get north of JPY 115 to start dropping at below corporate average.","John A. Ornell","Yes, exactly.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the second part of my question is that...","John A. Ornell","Exactly. And this will lead to a gross margin -- this -- it's probably a 50-50 split. I mean, it's a meaningful amount of amortization. We're ramping up sales particularly early in the year on those products. So you're having a bit more of an impact to start the year than finish the year. The yen will be more of an impact on margins as we make our way into the second quarter and through the fourth quarter as the yen started closer to JPY 90. It ended up closer to JPY 100 in the first quarter, so you didn't have a full quarter impact. So that mix will change a little bit as UNIFI sales ramp up as time goes on and as we feel the full impact of the yen on margins Qs 2 through 4.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Doug, quickly, on the chemistry and reoccurring business, what gives you the confidence that it kind of gets back to a normalized growth level for the rest of the year?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, partly, Peter, we've already seen the dynamic change early on in the second quarter. We've also looked at the order patterns region by region and have become more confident that some of the lumpy order patterns for large chemistry orders in places like China where you don't have the kind of traditional onesie-type of orders. You see much more bulk ordering in those territories. And we saw an unusual dropoff and then a quick pickup. So it's -- and we've looked at the competitive offerings. We've looked at the other dynamics that could change it, and we don't see -- we're not anticipating robust sales, but we're pretty confident of the return to the mid-single-digit chemistry dynamics that, in even a depressed year, we think we can return to.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And the software amortization, why is that an issue now? Why wasn't that anticipated at beginning of the year? Is it [indiscernible] ...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Oh, no, no.","John A. Ornell","It was.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","It was anticipated. So the deltas I'm talking about weren't deltas from the guide. It was from last year. So we did anticipate that and talked about it coming into play right at the start of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Just 2 real quick questions. So I know you don't have a ton of overlap in terms of your end market customers with Shimadzu and Hitachi, but have you seen any change in the competitive dynamic in -- with your Japanese competitors now that the yen has gotten a little bit more in their favor?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I don't think, in a broad way, we've seen the much difference, Derik. The Japanese haven't changed their spots from when the yen was JPY 120 to when it was JPY 90. They've always tended to be low-priced competitors, and we haven't seen -- I think they may be taking this opportunity to enhance their own P&Ls rather than think that a further low-priced strategy is going to do much for them.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I mean, that's consistent with what we've heard from some other companies. And just one other follow-up, I guess on the applied markets, you mentioned that growth there was a little bit more modest. Can you elaborate a little bit on this? Was this in food? Was this -- I'm just curious in terms of what you're seeing there because that's been such a big driver.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","No. Food actually was reasonably good. It was environmental applications. In some of the industrial chemical applications, we're probably more on the soft side.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So you're including industrial chemical on that one. Okay, great.","Operator","Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones here. As we think about kind of the back half of the year, are you able to just give us a sense as to some of the -- how we should think about some of the new products tracking, in particular the advanced polymer chromatography that you talked about at Pittcon earlier this year?","John A. Ornell","Yes. That product is likely, Tycho, to be a rather modest sales product across the second half of the year. It's a rather limited set of customers. There'll be meaningful interest from the Dows, the DuPonts, the 3Ms and the like, but it's not going to add a point of growth as we look at Q3 and Q4. As time goes on and the product ramps up, maybe we get a little more juice from that, but it just isn't a market that is likely to create a meaningful top line dynamic in the second half of this year.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","What could be much more significant is the UPC2 that got a -- we got a little bit of momentum from late in last year but really is building momentum as we go through this year. So I think the UPC2 could be a much more significant dynamic than the APC.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And on UNIFI, can you talk about how we should -- you think about tracking the success of that business? Are you able to give us a rough sense of how many customers you have today? And I think in your comments you talked about kind of pulling through instruments sales with that as well, so...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. I think, you've see most of the dynamic, at this point, on UNIFI coming from tailored systems. UNIFI has not launched in terms of its overall chromatography network-based systems. But it clearly, with the launch of UNIFI into the high-end mass spec systems, this has been clearly partly what drove the enhanced position in the first quarter. We've see clear evidence of that. But I think that the beauty of UNIFI is that as you go through this year and into next year, more and more of the broad-based chromatography and mass spec applications come under the UNIFI umbrella and offer significant upgrade opportunities, as well as competitive advantages in many of these applications.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, did you quantify the delayed pharma orders? I know you've talked about in a number of questions here, but did you actually quantify that?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","No, we didn't. It's multi-million dollars but less than $10 million.","Operator","Our next question is from Sung Ji Nam of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing trends, specifically for the mass spec business.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm sorry, I lost the last part of that. Could you repeat the question?","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Yes. Pricing trends for the mess spec business?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'd say they're nothing noticeable in terms of changes in pricing trends in our mass spec business. You can see it, our margins have been the same. Certainly, not major price increases, but no significant changes. Yes, stable prices I think is probably the way to characterize it.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then lastly, I was wondering if you could maybe talk about if there are any updates to your -- how you look at the diagnostic, clinical diagnostic opportunity in the medium term and if there are any updates there.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We're still very optimistic about the diagnostic opportunities. We continue to invest both R&D and early-stage marketing. And -- but I wouldn't say that we have anything to report on any major breaking news on the diagnostics front. But we continue to be encouraged about the long-term applications of LC\/MS in the diagnostic marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Just regarding the improvement in mass spec you've seen, it sounds like it was with some European government customers. I guess, is that something that wrapped up in the first quarter? Or did that -- is that going to fall over to quarters over the remainder of the year? And I know when we talked a couple of months ago, you were expecting instrument growth this quarter be kind of closer to flatfish versus the 8% you did. So I was wondering what kind of changed or came in better versus what you guys were initially expecting a few months ago?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","No, I don't know what you mean by flattish, Steve. We're anticipating that the strength in mass spec continues more or less on the trajectory that it's on. So we don't see any competitive dynamic or market dynamic that changes the current momentum in the mass spec world.","John A. Ornell","I think QTof certainly was stronger in the quarter than we anticipated. We thought that mass spec, in some total, was going to do well, largely driven more by the triple quadruples than the high ends. So the high end did do better, but as a group of products, we thought that mass spec would do well, and it actually did a little better than that to start the year.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Operator, I think that will probably be an appropriate point to end the conference call. We've now been over an hour. So I think we'll just thank you all for participating, and we look forward to updating you on our next call.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded.  [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. Well and good morning, and welcome to this, the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call as usual is John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations. And as it's our normal practice, I'm going to start with an overview of the quarter's highlight, and then John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with an outlook for the first quarter of 2012 and for the full year. But before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.","John A. Ornell","During the course of this conference call, we will be making various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q1 and full year 2012. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.","For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, under Part I, captioned Business Risk Factors. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2012.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share included in this morning's press release.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Well, 2011 was a second consecutive year of double-digit sales growth and even faster earnings growth for Waters. Successful new product launches and healthy demand from our pharmaceutical customer base have been key factors in driving our growth. In addition, we continue to benefit from faster growth in developing countries and opportunities associated with our applied markets such as food testing and clinical diagnostics.","In short, we have offered industry-leading products and enjoy superior access to faster growing market segments, positions our organizations have worked high to achieve over a multiyear period.","I think it's also important to note that 2011 was a year of investment for Waters. During the year, we continued to bring new systems to market across all our major product lines and expanded field personnel to support rapidly expanding customer bases in these developing regions. We're confident that we have an adequate foundation to grow top and bottom line results in 2012, while maintaining our reputation for industry-leading customer service and support.","If you'll look at the fourth quarter, our sales grew organically 8%, and our adjusted earnings per share were up 13%. And all these results were a bit ahead of our expectations and represent the impact of continued strong business momentum.","For the Waters division, we saw strongest growth in our pharmaceutical and industrial chemical end markets. The pharmaceutical growth was particularly strong in Western Europe and in the U.S., indicative of a continuation of an instrument upgrade cycle that I cited earlier this year.","The combination of government and university shipments held up reasonably well during the quarter, most notably for the SYNAPT G2 system shipments that were delivered to academic institutions throughout the quarter. Going forward, as a result of continuing austerity measures, we expect less robust global sales to government agencies in Europe, Japan and the U.S. That's a segment that has recently accounted for about 5% of our worldwide sales.","A tough base of comparison limited the growth rate of our food analysis business in the quarter. You may recall, we benefited from food safety-related business in late 2010, especially from sales resulting from dairy product testing in China. As a result of these strong results in the prior year quarter, our Chemical Analysis business, which includes food and environmental testing, grew more slowly in this quarter.","Within the Waters division, constant currency sales to the pharmaceutical industry grew faster than the overall business. Applications within pharma that are driving growth include biopharmaceutical development and QC testing. Similarly to what we saw in the third quarter, business to CROs was robust, while sales to generic manufacturers were adversely impacted by slower growth in India.","Instrument sales to industrial chemical customers, a business that represents less than 10% of our sales, held up fairly well in the quarter with strength in developing markets in Asia and South America offsetting slower growth in Europe and the United States.","Our TA Division finished 2011 with a strong fourth quarter performance that completed a year of profitable growth with yet another double-digit sales growth quarter. During the quarter, the division benefited from sales of its new Discovery DSC and Discovery Hybrid Rheometer, these instruments that saw a balanced sales growth across major geographical regions.","In 2012 and beyond, TA will expand its system offerings with more Discovery-branded instruments, while continuing to expand its applications footprint into biological and high temperature material testing opportunities.","If you look at our sales geographically, constant currency sales growth in Europe, as we saw in the third quarter, exceeded our overall sales performance. Expected weakness in European government and academic labs was more than offset by strength in our pharmaceutical and chemical analysis segments. European pharmaceutical strength was largely outside of large multinational accounts and more focused on CRO and biopharmaceutical businesses.","Within chemical analysis applications, our European strength was most pronounced for food and environmental testing. In Asia, outside of Japan, our sales growth in China reflects the impact of large regulatory related pharmaceutical and food analysis shipments in the prior year quarter, and with these factors backed out of the prior year result, business trends in China continued to be strong and in line with our expectations.","Sales in India were somewhat lighter than we had expected, as a significant evaluation of the rupee within the quarter resulted in some ordering delays. Underlying demand for new instruments, primarily for generic drug makers in India, remains strong, and we anticipating seeing stronger ordering trends during the first half of 2012.","Waters division constant currency sales in Japan were about flat for the quarter, as relatively strong pharmaceutical sales were offset by declines in government and university sales. Though the general economic conditions in Japan are challenging, we feel that our competitive position is strong and that there could be an opportunity to grow our business there, as we anniversary the terrible earthquake and tsunami that hit last March.","In the United States, we benefited from strong chromatography instrument shipments to pharmaceutical accounts, continuing the trend of the H-Class adoption that we saw earlier in the year. Sales to combined university and government labs grew in the quarter, and we fulfilled orders for newly introduced instrument systems. As we saw in Europe, our strongest growth in the U.S. was for instrumentation for our applied markets, including food and environmental testing.","Now I'd like to talk about some of the product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables grew, at a high-single-digit rate in the quarter. The growth in chromatography consumables was driven by column sales in developing countries including China and India, while the growth of our service business was geographically balanced.","Looking at our Waters division instrument system sales, growth was comparable for LC\/MS instruments and LC instruments in the quarter. Key new systems introduced at ASMS, including our SYNAPT G2-S and ACQUITY I-Class UPLC, shipped throughout the quarter. Our tandem quadrupole growth was highest for the ultrasensitive Xevo TQ-S system. And during the quarter we introduced a new single quadrupole mass detector, the SQD 2. This new component has been designed to offer greater versatility, ease of use and reliability for routine mass detection. In addition, it provides users with Waters' universal source design to facilitate methods transferred from our Xevo and SYNAPT platforms.","On the chromatography front, UPLC instrument unit shipments again grew at a double-digit rate, with H-Class dominating ACQUITY sales. Throughout the quarter, we manufactured and delivered ACQUITY I-Class instruments, primarily its front-end technology for our new research mass spec platforms.","If you look back at full year 2011, the big story for us in LC has been the H-Class. Growth in shipments and revenues has consistently exceeded 20% through 2011 off of a strong 2010 performance. We feel we are entering 2012 with excellent momentum for our entire ACQUITY line and feel that there remains for us a very attractive opportunity to displace HPLC and routine testing and expand the application reach of liquid chromatography by promoting the performance, ease of use and reliability of UPLC.","In 2012, look for us to continue to introduce new application-tailored systems that offer more complete workflow benefits to customers. Generally, these systems will combine advanced mass spectrometry, ACQUITY UPLC and our new UNIFI platform, with application-specific chemistries and software applications.","Examples of this approach can be found in the well-received systems we commercialized in 2011, including our systems for regulated bioanalysis and biopharmaceutical characterization.","Financially, we are very pleased with our 2011 performance. As I mentioned earlier, 2011 was a year of significant investment for Waters, as we continued to introduce advanced instrument systems, to invest in the development and commercialization of our new UNIFI software platform and to bolster our field operations in the developing world. While doing all of the above, we managed to expand our operating margins and generate record free cash flow, about $0.25 of free cash flow for every sales dollar.","Looking at capital allocation, we primarily used our free cash to fund the continuation of our share repurchase program, a program that over the years has reduced our share count by 1\/3 and meaningfully grown our earnings per share without adding risks to future earnings growth.","In 2011, we continued on our targeted and relatively conservative acquisition plan. Our most recent acquisition enhanced the capability of our TA group to more quickly access business opportunities in high temperature materials testing.","This type of smaller acquisition is emblematic of our strategy and is a template for what we are likely to pursue in the upcoming years. But we can never rule out a more transformational M&A plan. It continues to be difficult for us to identify larger targets that in the long run will be accretive to our long-term sales growth and profitability.","Looking at 2012, we currently see fundamental consistency to the underlying drivers of our recent growth. Early in the year, we will be comparing our business to performance in 2011, where in a strong top line accompanied by conservative spending combined to create a tough base of comparison for operating income growth. However, as we ramp SG&A spending during 2011, the comparisons will likely become more favorable in the second half of 2012, allowing us to achieve higher operating leverage.","Macroeconomic uncertainties that have dominated recent headlines, including concerns about the health of European markets and global governmental austerity programs, are the primary factors in tempering our 2012 growth expectations relative to the results that we have delivered during the past 2 years. We feel that our strong product positions and our access to growing markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe position us well to weather through the uncertainties I've already cited.","Globally, we will remain confident that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to require our products for research and regulatory compliance applications, and we are also confident that our application-tailored system strategy will allow us to both secure a competitive advantage and expand our business into new application areas.","Now I'd like to turn it over to John for a more detailed review of our financials and the outlook.","John A. Ornell","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Fourth quarter sales increased by 8%, and non-GAAP earnings per share per diluted share were up 13% at $1.56 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.38 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.51 this quarter versus $1.36 last year, and a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is included in our press release issued this morning.","Reviewing Q4 sales results in comparison to Q4 last year, sales were up 8% with foreign currency translation about neutral to sales growth within the quarter. Looking at our sales growth geographically and before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were up 8%. Europe's sales were up 14%. Japan was flat and sales in Asia, outside of Japan, were down 1% against a strong base of comparison of more than 30% growth in the 2010 quarter.","On the product front and in constant currency within the Waters division, instrument system sales increased by 7% and recurring revenues grew by 7% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, sales increased by 17% versus prior year.","Now I would like to comment on our Q4 and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Gross margin performance came in as expected at 60.8% comparable to Q4 last year. SG&A expenses increased by 2% this quarter, slightly less than expected as a result of less FX translation impact. R&D expenses increased as expected at about 4% within the quarter, and our full year effective operating income tax rate came in a little lower than anticipated at 16%. This is due to a modest shift in profits among our legal entities favoring our lower tax rate jurisdictions. Applying this tax rate to our full year pretax income increased EPS by $0.03 this quarter versus our October expectation.","On the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.3 billion and debt totaled $991 million, bringing us to a net cash position of about $290 million. As for share repurchases, we bought 940,000 shares of our common stock for $73 million. This leaves $186 million remaining on the current authorized share repurchase program.","We defined free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.","For Q4, free cash flow came in at $150 million after funding $17 million of CapEx and adding back $3 million of noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation. This result excludes $16 million of capital spending associated with a land purchase this quarter for our new site in Manchester, U.K.","Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 64 days this quarter, down 3 days from Q4 last year. And inventories declined by $35 million this quarter, as new products shipped in expected volumes and the traditional heavier Q4 volume consumed inventories built up earlier in the year.","Overall, we are pleased with our full year 2011 financial performance, as we grew sales 10% in constant currency. This performance was geographically balanced and on the back of a 10% organic growth year in 2010. Gross margins expanded by 30 basis points in 2011, and operating margin expanded by 1%, as we leveraged our cost base around the world. And our non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share for the full year were up 18% over 2010.","Cash flow was very strong this year, too, with free cash flow of $461 million after funding $68 million of capital spending and adding back $18 million of noncash tax benefits from stock-based compensation. This result again excludes $16 million of capital spending on the new Manchester, U.K. facility. Of this free cash flow, $11 million was used on M&A, and $314 million was used to purchase $4.5 million shares of our stock under our share repurchase program.","As we now think about 2012, we continue to see stability in the majority of our markets and continued momentum in the acceptance of our new products. However, we may see pockets of weakness in our government and academic segment as the year plays out given the budgetary pressures many countries are facing, particularly in Western Europe and the U.S. So we believe that it makes sense to begin 2012 with a more cautious growth outlook than what we have recently experienced, and we currently expect sales to grow by 6% to 8% for 2012 before currency effects.","Currency at today's levels is expected to reduce full year sales growth by 2%. Reported sales growth, then, would be between 4% and 6%.","Moving down the P&L, gross margins are expected to be about flat with 2011 at about 16.5%. Operating expenses are expected to grow at a rate that is slightly less than sales, as we continue to manage our operating expenses judiciously. Our net interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to be about 16%.","Our fully diluted average outstanding share count is likely to be just under 90 million shares outstanding, and rolling all of this together, we currently expect 2012 non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in a range of $5.15 to $5.30 per share.","As we think about our expectations for the first quarter of 2012, please remember that 2011 started off extremely strong with 16% sales growth and 28% earnings growth. Against this challenging base of comparison, we expect organic sales growth of about 5% in the first quarter of 2012.","Currency translation at today's rates would reduce sales by 2%, resulting in reported sales growth of about 3%. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.10 for the first quarter. Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Operator, I think at this point, we can open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You again highlighted resilience in the pharmaceutical end market, both in the U.S. and Europe. You attributed this to an ongoing replacement cycle. Could you just provide any color that's available on how balanced this replacement cycle is across LC and mass spec and also how balanced this replacement cycle is across the different subsegments within pharma, meaning CROs, generics and big pharma?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Okay, sure, Doug. I can give you a little bit of flavor on that. The quarter was remarkably balanced, I'd say, between LC and mass spec, very similar results. If you look within pharma, CROs were the strongest players, and our big pharmaceutical customers were flattish. So that's probably, I think, been a continuing dynamic. Although, we did see an absolute level of growth from our big pharma customers as you move quarter-to-quarter through 2011. I'd say the applications that were notable for their growth -- first of all, H-Class is -- continues to be the strongest performer in the chromatography area, and we see some clear signs that, that's penetrating into the pharmaceutical QC applications and that's penetration. So that's, I think, good news for us. At the same time, some of our new systems offerings that are aimed at the bio area, biopharmaceutical QC in particular, which is a different animal of course versus the small molecule world, are doing very well. So I think those are probably the notable dynamics.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And in H-Class specifically, I mean, you've done quite well there. There's a big install base to go after in -- of the alliance instruments within big pharma. How would you characterize what inning you're in, in terms of replacing those instruments with H-Class?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Oh, I think we're still early in the game there. We're really only in the second -- 2011 was the second year of the H-Class introduction, and I'd say we really only started penetrating those applications this past year. So I think we're early on, and we're very optimistic about the long-term opportunity there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","I just had 2 quick questions. The first, Doug, is I guess maybe if you could provide a little more color geographically around how you expect things to play out in 2012. Obviously, you ended the quarter where Asia x Japan is down a little bit, and you were up like 32% last year. But maybe just talk geographically about how you see things playing out. And then, John, I was just wondering if you could -- you mentioned kind of flattish gross margins. I know currency probably is a little bit of an issue there. Can you maybe just talk about kind of organically what's happening on the gross margin line?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure. I think -- in term -- the way to think about our outlook geographically is you think about the -- what we call the emerging areas. I mean, we continue to use that terminology. Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, we strongly believe that those areas are going to grow above our corporate average in 2012. That's been true in the past, it's likely to be very true in 2012. We've got the applications, the organization and the momentum going there, and I think that's very credible. We think the areas of slower growth is still likely to be Western Europe. There's enough uncertainty around elements in Western Europe. Even though we're coming off a very good quarter, we're still a little cautious about Western Europe going forward. And Japan, we are hopeful that we see some relief, just structural relief in Japan, but we're going to wait to see that. The U.S., I think, is probably going to be around the corporate average. So that breaks that. John, you want to cover the...","John A. Ornell","Sure. On the gross margin, the thinking there is that we've got a little bit less volume leverage at a top line growth that's 6% to 8% instead of the 10% we just came off of. We plan on having a higher mix of Tof-based products in the mix, which tends to pull the margin down a little bit. And as you said before, Jon, FX is a little bit of a headwind. So there's small amounts of tenths of a point movement, plus or minus to kind of net to a rather flat position versus 2011.","Operator","Next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you hear me okay?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Quintin, are you there?","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Hello?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. We're ready.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So again looking into the 2012 guidance, you talked a little bit about maybe a cautious look on the academic side. What are you seeing on the pharma side, Doug? Continued uptick? Is it new products? Or is it also just replacement of some of the changing out the aging instruments as well?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, Quintin, we have some natural benefit from products that were introduced in the second half of 2011, getting full bore in 2012, as well as focused application systems, like the regulated bioanalysis system, which combines the I-Class with the TQ-S and the system for biopharmaceutical QC. All of which were introduced kind of during 2011 and should provide us incremental growth in 2012. I think if you look at applications or broad areas of our business for next year, we think the broadscale pharma business is likely to grow at about our corporate average. We think the application-specific areas like food safety, food testing, clinical are likely to grow a little bit above average, and the government and academic business is going to grow below average. That's kind of the mix of our plan for 2012.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then with respect to kind of new product introductions, you launched the TQ-S, I guess, 2 now. And last year, you introduced I-Class early on in the year. Is it now that new products will just get launched when they're ready or off the cycle of waiting for big conferences like ASMS?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think generally you'll find that major LC introductions are still made around Pittcon and major -- particularly higher-end mass specs are introduced around ASMS. So that's first quarter for Pittcon, late second quarter kind of for ASMS. That's still traditionally -- now you may introduce a system and not be shipping it for a couple of months. I mean, you typically don't want to wait much more than 2 or 3 months before you're ready to ship it because you're getting expectations and you're maybe cannibalizing your existing product line. So I think that, that's pretty much par for the course in the industry, and it's just the introductions don't necessarily closely follow for shipments.","Operator","Next question comes from Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess my first question would be on the competitive dynamics. This is an issue that we get asked about a whole lot, and I was wondering if you could talk about any market shares, dynamics in your key technology and markets about LC\/MS, please.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, it's always dangerous to talk about change in market share dynamics based on one quarter. So I think there's nothing that I would feel comfortable about saying as a result of the fourth quarter. If you look at the full year and you look at our organic instruments growth, it was north of 10%. I think it's pretty -- I'm pretty secure in saying I think overall, we picked up market share in 2011. I think H-Class continues to penetrate into new labs and new applications that we didn't serve before. So I'm pretty comfortable with that. I think the introduction of our new mass spec systems has clearly garnered us new business. But I think in general, I think, that mass spec business continues to be very competitive. Nobody's getting out of the business, and so I think it continues to be a pretty vibrant, competitive area for all of us suppliers.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, I was wondering with the consolidation that we've seen in the industry and more sort of LC\/MS full suite of offerings coming from competitors, sort of wondering if that has changed anything.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Oh, I'd say certainly coming from consolidate -- I don't see any major dynamic going on as a result of consolidation. Certainly, not at this point. I'd say the competition that we're looking at, particularly in the mass spec arena, come from the same places we have seen it for the last 5 years, using the same competitive tools. And I don't see very much in the way of shifts resulting from consolidation there.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I really appreciate the commentary. And maybe one quick one for John on the gross margins. I know you mentioned the Tofs in the mix. But John, could you talk a little bit more around just the instrumentation system that we see some amount of slowdown on the instrumentation side and mix shifts towards the recurring revenues? What sort of benefit can we see from maybe include detach rates on consumables or a revenue pickup from your service investments last year?","John A. Ornell","I guess I'd say generally, Nandita, that we're looking at growth rates for 2012 that are relatively comparable for instruments and recurring revenue. So if there's going to be a mix shift in the year, it's going to be rather small. So I wouldn't think it would result in more than a 10 basis point change from flat. So I would say it's possible but not likely to be that significant.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the Asia x Japan business, obviously tough comp in the quarter. As we sort of move into Q1 with the Chinese New Year a little bit earlier this year, do you have sort of comfort in sort of stabilization acceleration in that business based on sort of the order patterns we sort of ended the quarter with x some of those onetime headwinds from last year? And are we seeing that -- any confirmation of that in Q1 so far?","John A. Ornell","I'd say as we look at the base of comparison and the pace of business in Asia, we're pretty comfortable that we're back to our more traditional growth rate in that region of the world. We've got a year-end spend in India that we expect to see come through and the base of comparison in China's easier. So the expectation is for meaningful growth coming out of that region of the world pretty early in the year.","Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Were you at all surprised by the magnitude of sort of the strength in late December? I mean, I know the world was sort of an odd place from the summer through the early fall to winter just from a uncertainty perspective. But it seemed like we've seen some decent follow-through in the month of December in terms of re-acceleration. Were you kind of surprised by that on the capital equipment side at all?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I wouldn't say we were terribly surprised. I think the fourth quarter, always when completing the year you're -- you want to finish strong, but there was nothing remarkable, I don't think, that went on in the fourth quarter. I know there was some cautiousness on the part of observers of the industry, but we didn't -- the quarter was well balanced, interestingly. It wasn't like we saw late strength in any particular area that pulled out the quarter, so I think the balance is kind of what's notable in the results.","Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just lastly, John, what are the rates you're using for the FX cal? Because we're getting Q1, as well as the year, even on current rate, something, I think, a bit less of a headwind than sort of what you provided.","John A. Ornell","I'm using the euro at somewhere around 128, 129; the yen, somewhere around 77; and the pound around 153. There are a basket of other currencies throughout the world that we do consider. These are the major currencies, but there are Canadian dollar, the Aussie dollar. There's other places that need to be considered. And I'm coming up with kind of a weak 2% effect in the first quarter, pretty full to a 2% effect for the full year, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","What scenarios for government funding are in your forecast? Do you assume something like an 8% cut to the NIH budget? Or are you assuming something less than that? If you could just walk me through that.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","The NAIH -- the NIH budget isn't all of that important to our run rates, Dan. It's -- Oh, Christ, John, what's the amount that's directly...","John A. Ornell","$15 million or so direct. As a percent of our business, 2 at the very most. You try to roll in as best we can.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. And government spending overall, yes, is not that -- but it's clearly an area of cautiousness. I mean it's -- particularly it's an area of not only in the U.S. but in Japan and in Western Europe. So we are anticipating that, that is going to be slower next year than we saw this year, and it's probably going to be more flattish than anything else.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. What are your expectations from your generic customer base given that we're in peak year of the cliff here? Do you expect they're going to continue buying as usual? Or did you see anything like a big bump in orders in advance of the genericization cliff that maybe will present a tough comp?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think you're really going to -- we think about the generic business kind of in 2 parts. A big part being in India and another big part being almost everywhere else. Some of it within big pharma companies. Some is independent, stand-alone generics. Clearly in India, we saw a slowdown in the fourth quarter that our accounts tell us is solely due to the weakness in the rupee and the need to recalculate their budgets and redo their capital. They're highly optimistic about returning to a significant growth phase as we go into 2012. We've seen that kind of behavior before, and we believe that, that's going to happen. If you look at the rest of our generic business, it was a good year in 2011. I see no indication on the part of those accounts that they've stopped investing for the future. And I think we're pretty confident as these accounts look at the productivity capabilities in UPLC that this is another area where the move to UPLC is likely to continue and offer us growth opportunities going forward. So overall, I'd say generics look good for 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to get a little bit more color on the industrial chemical business segment. You talked about Europe and U.S. having slower growth. Can you put some numbers around that and give us some detail about how you're thinking about that segment in 2012?","John A. Ornell","Yes, I think we're a little bit cautious as we think about Western Europe and maybe a little bit of impact associated with a lower GDP in that region of the world. So we've seen, across this year, relatively strong growth in our industrial business including reasonable growth in that geography. We think we might see that business in Western Europe slow down. I think offsetting that to some extent is we have some pretty good confidence that with the TA division, there's a number of products that are recently introduced and others that are coming that will continue to drive growth at least in their portion of that industrial segment. So seeing it move to a mid-single-digit growth from a double-digit growth or a high-single-digit growth is probably a reasonable way to think about that business as we think about a 6% to 8% business overall. I'm not including in that food safety and other applications that I think will grow faster, but the segments that go to the Dows, DuPonts the 3Ms and their equivalent counterparts overseas are likely to be under a bit more pressure, we feel, in '12 as we move forward.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think the good news is that those accounts generally are in good financial condition. They have improved their balance sheets, improved their earnings. So that might be an area where the results exceed our expectations coming up. Certainly, TA, you might consider is a little bit of a canary in a mineshaft, the kind of a high preponderance of business in those industrial accounts, particularly polymer application. And there's no real signs of slowing there. So that might be an area where we prove to be a little more conservative than the actuals.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up, John, on the SG&A, can you just talk a little bit about the cadence for the year? Should it be flat throughout given the investments you've already made? Or are there any particular quarters where we should expect any bump ups in the absolute SG&A expense for 2012?","John A. Ornell","No, I don't think there's anything from a base of comparison that's, that difficult. I think you'll see SG&A track the sales growth minus 0.5 point to maybe 1.5 points difference in growth rate, if you will, across the year. So I would not expect to see major deltas by quarter as we think about the 4 quarters of '12 versus '11.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","We did ramp up SG&A a little bit across 2011, so the comparisons are a little bit tougher in the first quarter and easier in later in the year.","John A. Ornell","Yes, but not dramatically so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just following up on some of the pharma questions earlier. Obviously, you saw some nice momentum here in that business. You talked about it growing faster than the overall business. Given where we are in the QA\/QC adoption cycle for ACQUITY, why couldn't that continue to outgrow the overall business? I think your comment before was that could be closer to flattish for the year for large pharma.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","No, I said large pharma -- let me repeat myself. Large pharma overall in the fourth quarter was flat growth, but it -- we did show incremental revenue from those large pharma, that we're talking the top 15 to 20 account sequentially during the year. So fourth quarter was the biggest quarter of the year, but it often is. So -- and pharma all in for the fourth quarter grew at the corporate average. So those are the facts. H-Class, for both the quarter and the year was the fastest-growing LC in our business, and the fastest-growing applications for H-Class were in small molecule QC, so just so we understand our factual situation. Now we think H-Class is going to continue to grow faster in those applications. It's really a question in pharma as to where the balance of that business comes in next year, R&D spending across the base of big accounts, generics and other biotech accounts. So right now, we're saying that, that's likely to be at the corporate average next year. If we see stronger penetration in the H-Class across the small molecule world, that's likely to be a benefit. But that's what we've got modeled in our expectation for 2012.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And are you seeing interest from customers for standardizing on H-Class? I know you had some customers previously standardize on ACQUITY before you launched H-Class, so just wondering if you're seeing that as well.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'd say we're seeing customers standardize on ACQUITY UPLC technology. We have some very clear examples of that. That may mean that they're using I-Class in research applications with mass spec, and they're using H-Class. We're still seeing a kind of powerful story for these accounts who have traditionally used HPLC in their quality control who like the idea of buying H-Class, being able to use it for their traditional methods with their traditional chemistries, as they take a longer time to upgrade to true UPLC applications. What's interesting is we really are seeing them migrate to UPLC applications. It's all a question of the pace and the momentum that, that builds. But I think the evidence is pretty strong that, that's the direction they're going in.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then you guys recently announced the partnership with Tecan for clinical assay platforms, obviously using your existing technology. But just talk a little bit how you're thinking about the clinical opportunity going forward that you've obviously touched on in various parts of the mass spec business previously.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, I think the clinical applications are an interesting area. I'd say in the last several years, we have devoted more time and attention to clinical applications than we have historically. We've been particularly successful, I'd say, in providing systems for clinical monitoring in the anti-rejection, immunosuppressant marketplace. We're seeing good success in vitamin D analysis. And as we've gotten more intense in those areas and we've built our organization up, we've looked at more opportunities to utilize particularly the power and the broad-spectrum capabilities of mass spectrometry to penetrate into areas that more traditionally used other diagnostic tests. So I would say, we're investing pro-rata more in that area. We think there are many opportunities. It's a very broad category, monitoring of pain medications, forensic analysis. It's -- when we talk about clinical, it's a broad area. And I'd say overall, you'd see that area of our business grow faster than average over the next 5 years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jefferies.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","John, can you walk us through the cash assumptions in your modeling for '12, so specifically operating cash flow, CapEx, both the base level and whatever you're going to do on the micro mass facility and then your base assumptions for share repurchase, please?","John A. Ornell","Sure. Well, we think our net cash flow is going to be somewhere in the $500 million of free cash flow, if you will, after CapEx. CapEx is probably going to be somewhere around $75 million. Now that does not include capital that we'll deploy on the Manchester facility, which is likely to be somewhere between maybe $30 million and $35 million, depending on how quickly construction begins. As it relates to the share repurchase program, the guidance that I've provided contemplates share repurchases at about $70 million or so a quarter across the year in equivalent, but it's across the year. So about $280 million, $300 million or so in free cash flow procured evenly across the quarters for the year.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then the little acquisition you guys did in the third quarter, the contribution there, it basically rounds to 0, correct, on kind of the growth rate for '12?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, yes.","John A. Ornell","It's de minimis.","Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then, Doug, any comments just on the acquisition pipeline as it stands today? Are there more Anter-type acquisitions in the pipe? Or is there a midsized deal you see 6 to 12 months out? Just any commentary you can give us on...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, I would say more on the Anter, slightly larger sized, but not medium sized. The ones we're talking about range on the revenue line from $5 million in revenue to maybe $15 million to $20 million in annual revenue, and we're tending to be more successful on the smaller ones and they've done very well over time for us. So we like to continue it, and we like the risk profile. And we'd love to do a $50 million one that was just as good, but those are harder to find.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Doug, the slightly less than expected EPS guidance for 2012, is that mostly driven by the top line uncertainty or of -- in those difficult comps in one -- in the first half or the negative effects from FX on the P&L?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm sorry. I didn't get the full gist. The slightly lower guidance for 2012, is that -- I'm sorry, I didn't get the implication.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Oh, and what are the moving parts there? Is it the top line uncertainty, the difficult comps in the first half or negative effects from FX on the P&L?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","The biggest change -- we see 2 dynamics, I'd say. We're a little more cautious about the university and government piece of the business,"," worldwide and the significant change in foreign currency year-over-year. And the foreign exchange, a 2% change. While we're relatively well hedged compared to a number of companies worldwide, there's no question that a stronger dollar does negatively affect our results. An estimate of how much that affects us next year's probably in the $0.10 range versus 2011. Is that's right, John?","John A. Ornell","$0.10 versus a flat currency scenario. So it's about $0.05 per point roughly. I mean, that can vary depending on which currency. But I would tell you that if we were talking about 6% to 8% growth with no currency impact, our earnings would be $0.10 or so higher than what we've described.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's really helpful. And then the CRO strength, was that U.S. strength or emerging market?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That's worldwide. I'd say we saw a real strength in Western Europe, but generally, it's a common dynamic in our business that the CROs were strong.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then just use of capital, is there a high likelihood of expanding that buyback program and the potential pacing at the existing buyback?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, it's been true for about 9 years now. So I see no reason why it's not likely to be true. It would be unusual in the extreme for us to do significantly less than that. If there were a large meaningful acquisition on the horizon, which we don't see, that would change things. But absent an unusual transaction, we would continue to deploy cash to buy back our stock.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I just want to dig in a little bit on the academic stuff. So John, you said or, Doug, you basically said that you had strong G2 sales to your academic customers in Q4. Were the orders placed -- everything's off the map on September it sounds like for a lot of the companies. Were the orders placed for the G2s that you shipped in Q4, were those placed prior September? Or were they after September? I'm just trying to see if we're seeing -- whether we're seeing order growth in the academic markets late in the year.","John A. Ornell","There's some of each, Derik. There's no doubt though that we ended -- we went into Q4 with a very meaningful backlog on the G2. We booked orders in the fourth quarter as well that we were able to satisfy, and we booked orders in the fourth quarter that are now in backlog leading into Q1. So just the fact that the product was slow coming out of manufacturing that we did build up a meaningful backlog both in the second and third quarter for that product though in particular.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division",", ","For the last 2 years, you've grown R&D over 9%. How should we think about R&D growth for 2012? It sounds like -- I mean, you've done some major product introductions. I would expect to see some moderation.","John A. Ornell","Yes, I'd say we're going to continue to spend on R&D as we need to. I would say that it's likely be closer to growth in sales than SG&A. It's possible in a quarter or 2 that you'll see as growing a bit faster than sales. Overall, we're not looking at changing in a meaningful way the percent of R&D, for some sales that R&D represents. But there will be some new products that will require some project expense. That's a little bit lumpy that you'll see across the quarters, but you're not talking about millions of dollars. You're talking $1 million perhaps in one quarter that's a little bit out of place versus prior year growth rate in one particular quarter that approaches 10%, for example, would be a pretty high expense in that quarter. So I don't think, in some total there's a lot of variability you'll see in our R&D spending as you think about this year versus history.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just one final question. So I thought one of your more interesting product introductions in 2011 was the UNIFI system and just trying to integrate your CDS with your mass spec system. And how has that been received by the market? And I would assume that the bioanalytical was kind of the first launch with that. I assume that there's other ones coming with that. I guess, can you just talk a little bit about your -- what you're kind of seeing for uptick?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, I think, what you've seen us do first with UNIFI is launch it on specific application systems. So regulated bioanalysis and bio pharm. When the UNIFI platform kicks in as a major dynamic is when it's launched as the full-service upgrade to our Empower, both single system and network system applications. That won't happen in 2012. So you're going to continue to see it operate as a powerful software platform on a specific niche product this year. The reaction has been very good, but I wouldn't have you believe that it has a major impact on our software business in 2012.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Jeff Ares - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Jeff, in for Isaac. Looking at the academic, government piece, you guys seem to be a little bit more cautious heading in 2012 than you were in 2011. I think one of the things you highlighted this quarter that was weak was Japan. Is the addition of Japan being another weak geographic area the source of the incremental concern? Or are you guys just kind of taking a more cautious approach?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'd say it's just generally a more cautious worldwide approach given the fact that we're almost certain to see government budgets be more conservative going forward, not only in the United States but certainly in Western Europe and in Asia. So it's a broader dynamic rather than specifically Japan. In Japan, we've had tough conditions, particularly in our segments where government spending, if anything, was tilted more towards the effects of the tsunami and the earthquake rather than into more classical broad-based R&D applications. So we might actually see a little bit of benefit in Japan, but that remains to be seen.","Jeff Ares - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then kind of looking at it from the first half of this year and the second half versus what your outlook is for 2012, is it fair to say that your outlook is more cautious than what you experienced in the back half of this past year? Or is it kind of continuing the third quarter, fourth quarter run rate for the academic demand throughout '12?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I'd say our outlook for the first half is influenced more by the strength that we saw in the first half of our business last year, particularly the first quarter. Our fourth quarter, again, a bunch of dynamics going on there, but our absolute growth rate in the fourth quarter was a little bit lower than our full year growth rate and so that we're not expecting our run rates to change significantly as we go into 2012, but we are a little bit more cautious. particularly on the university and government side of our business. Combined with tough comparisons in the first half, I'd say that's the most notable structural difference in our outlook.","Jeff Ares - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess what I'm asking is from the fourth quarter what you saw in U.S. -- or global academic government to what you're expecting for the full year for 2012. Are you expecting a sequential deceleration?","John A. Ornell","Yes. We're thinking that government and academic could be flattish perhaps for 2012, and that's versus being up low- to mid-single-digit in 2011. So yes, we are thinking that it's possible that government agencies and the spend promoted by governments will be a little bit more pressured in '12 versus '11.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wondering if this year we should expect some new products on the chemistry side for I-Class, and if so, what that might do for pricing or for margins on columns.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I wouldn't say anything unusual, but we will -- we're always introducing new flavors. But I wouldn't have you believe that a new platform introduction is imminent to affect that growth rate significantly, in really application-specific columns that are aimed as much as stimulating system sales as they are consumable sales.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then, Doug, I know you've commented on pharma quite a bit, but I guess just briefly, a lot of what we're hearing on biopharma in '12 is related to sort of the prioritization of late-stage projects towards trials maybe at the expense of some early-stage stuff. So -- but presumably this is not a new phenomenon. So I guess from your perspective, is there anything different about what you're hearing in the way that you're -- or the way that you're viewing to '12 versus '11 relative to project preferences?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think, certainly what one of the strongest application areas that we've seen in the second half of '11 is in biopharmaceutical QC. And that's, as you know, a much different animal than the typical QC applications for small molecular weight drugs. It's in some ways, more art than science there, but it's getting more refined and clearly demanding more advanced technologies like higher-end LC\/MS. So we've been very gratified to see that our offerings in that biopharmaceutical world has been very well received. I think that is highly likely to continue through 2012. But I also think that particularly with monoclonal antibodies, a lot of research going on, a lot of that research pound for pound takes more higher-end analytical instrumentation than small molecule drugs. So I think that general dynamic works in our favor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","I just have 2 very quick ones. John, going back to growth margins, longer term, is there further headroom for growth aside from volume leverage? Or is it largely driven by product mix at this point?","John A. Ornell","Well, we've ended up over time with a manufacturing strategy that has moved products into Ireland, has moved products into Singapore, and across many years, we've been able to take advantage of that, both from a product cost perspective as well as a tax rate perspective. And I would tell you that right now, that program is pretty much complete. The businesses are growing with volume, but there aren't large numbers of products that continue to be ramped up to move into those lower-cost jurisdictions. All of that being said, when the business grows in the high-single digits, you're right. There's still volume leverage to be had, and thinking about the business, having 10, 20 basis points of gross margin expansion through the leverage of a fixed base of manufacturing cost is still true. We're a little cautious in stating that to flatly this year just given the fact that the lower end of our range perhaps doesn't provide all of that, and FX is a bit of a headwind this time. So I wouldn't say that the gross margin expansion party is over. Certainly, large leaps in the expansion are as a result of product transfers but small incremental movements with volume, which we continue to see as time goes forward.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And Doug, you mentioned in terms of the I-Class platform, primarily going as a front end to your research-based mass spectrometers. What component of that -- is it coming from product replacements of your legacy UPLC platform? And overtime, I would -- my question is what percentage of your overall legacy UPLC platform do you anticipate to be replaced with this I-Class platform?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think that's a very fair question. I think, currently, we'd say that I-Class is probably replacing classic ACQUITYs. And over time, you're probably going to see most of that research-grade ACQUITY translate from classic ACQUITY more to the I-Class. I think that will take a while. Certainly, we're pricing the I-Class at a premium to the classic UPLC, and we think that makes the most sense right now. But over time, those systems are likely to come together.","Well, thank you all for being with us, and we appreciate high quality of questions and the interest. And we look forward to talking to you all again at the end of the first quarter. Take care.","Operator","Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call. We appreciate you being able to change your schedules in order to be with us late this afternoon. It was a result of the weather emergency and the mandatory travel restrictions that were announced this afternoon by the Governor of Massachusetts that we decided our best way to deal with it was to release earnings at the close of business today rather than wait for tomorrow morning when we weren\u2019t sure what the conditions would allow us to do. So, thank you for bearing with us.","With me on today\u2019s call is Gene Cassis, the Waters\u2019 CFO; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations.","Today, I am going to start with an overview of the business and Gene will follow with details of our financial results and an outlook for our business in 2015. But before we start, I\u2019d like Gene to cover the cautionary language.","Gene Cassis","Well, thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for the first quarter of 2015 and for full year 2015. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our Form 10-K Annual Report for fiscal year ending December 31, 2013 in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2015.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly compatible GAAP measures is attached to the company\u2019s earnings release issued this afternoon. In our discussion of results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials and that\u2019s included in this afternoon\u2019s press release. Doug?","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you, Gene. Well, I am pleased to tell you that our 8% constant currency revenue increase in the fourth quarter was a strong finish to 2014 and resulted in full year sales growth of 6%, a rate that\u2019s actually in line with our original full year outlook. And I think that\u2019s notable, because you will recall that our first quarter was significantly weaker than originally planned. So, we saw significant strengthening in the business as the year progressed.","Looking at the full year, the big story was stronger demand from our pharmaceutical sector. This strength was geographically broad-based with improved demand from both research and quality control segments. So, with this increase in global pharmaceutical business that offset the softer demand that we and others saw in China throughout most of 2014. Consistent with our history and carefully managed \u2013 we carefully managed our expenses through the year, while launching new instrument systems and integrating a handful of small acquired businesses. So, for the full year, our adjusted earnings per share were up 9% after foreign currency headwinds reduced earnings per share by about $0.22 or 4%. Looking at the fourth quarter constant currency sales for the corporation were up 8% with instrument systems growing 6% and our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables up a strong 10%.","If you look at our operating divisions Waters Division sales grew by 10%, again at constant currency. The strength that we saw in the quarter for the Waters Division was very encouraging and as the division saw a similar growth in the fourth quarter 2013. So that made for a tough base of comparison. Our TA Instrument Division sales declined at 5% in the fourth quarter. And I will describe the contributing dynamics shortly.","Currency and translation reduced our sales growth by 5% in the quarter as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening against all major currencies. Geographically and for the Waters Division sales in the U.S. were up 12%. In the quarter we saw a continued strength in pharmaceutical spending and healthy government and academic growth. Industrial chemical growth declined against a very strong result in the prior year. For the full year sales in the U.S. were up 8%. Sales growth in Europe for the Waters Division and at constant currency was up 10%, similarly to the U.S. we saw a strong pharmaceutical, government and academic spending. For the full year Waters Division European sales were up 6% and benefited from stronger pharmaceutical sales growth throughout most of the year.","We came into the year with some concern that general economic conditions would limit our growth in Europe. However, the large proportion of our sales to pharmaceutical end markets in combination with very positive uptake of our advanced mass spectrometry instruments by academic and government labs allowed us to deliver a very solid full year performance. In Asia, China is our largest market and I am pleased to report that shipment volume increased nicely in the fourth quarter and revenues grew 13% for the Waters Division. Consistent with Europe and the U.S., sales to pharma and government supported research labs drove the overall sales growth in China.","Though I feel it\u2019s premature on the basis of one quarter to believe that business conditions in China will allow us to grow at a much accelerated rate in future quarters, we are encouraged by the fourth quarter\u2019s improvement. Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan were up moderately in the quarter with stronger pharmaceutical and chemical industry demand offsetting a decline in public sector spending. In the quarter Waters Division sales in India were up over 20%. The 2014 growth in India was primarily associated with higher instrument, software and service sales from the generic drug industry. Top line growth strengthened across the year and we believe that last year\u2019s business momentum will sustain into 2015 as drug firms continue to expand their manufacturing capacity and make needed investments to ensure regulatory compliance. Our sales in Asian markets outside of Japan, China and India grew moderately in the quarter.","Our TA Instruments Division saw a mid-single digit decline in sales in the quarter admittedly against a strong result delivered in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Geographically TA shipments in China were weaker than expected as the conversion of orders to sales proceeded at a slower pace. Globally sales growth for the division was affected by a generally slower industrial, chemical climate.","Now I would like to discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. The division\u2019s recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables grew at 11% rate in the quarter. Chromatography consumable sales were strong in the quarter and grew by 8%. Consumables growth was strongest in Asia and in the Americas. Overall, the business continued to see strong uptake of UPLC column offerings including our more recently introduced line of CORTECS columns. The Waters Division service business also performed very well in the quarter, including a 13% rate with balanced strength across all major regions in the world.","For the full year and at constant currency, Waters Division service revenues grew 10%. Waters Division instrument system sales grew 9% in the fourth quarter. LC, LC\/MS and informatics sales all contributed to the strong and balanced performance. And in the quarter, we began to see a positive impact from the new UPLC-MS systems launched mid year in at ASMS. Instrument systems continued to benefit from the rapid uptake of ACQUITY QDa, an advanced mass spectrometry-based LC detector that we introduced in the fourth quarter of 2013.","On our October earnings call I described for you the REIMS technology that we acquired as part of our recent MediMass acquisition. You may recall that REIMS is an atmospheric ionization technique with potentially a broad range of applications, including a longer term potential usage as a medical device to optimize surgical outcomes, notably for certain oncology procedures.","REIMS technology is complementary to other atmospheric pressure ionization techniques that we offer and are very excited about its benefits to our recently announced health science initiative. This initiative, which we formally organized in 2014, recognizes an important transition in medical research that demands a suite of advanced technologies, including research grade mass spectrometry to attain a more comprehensive understanding of disease. This molecular-based understanding will result in more effective predictive diagnostic and therapeutic tools to cost effectively manage human health.","I am pleased to tell you that in the fourth quarter we began to fund the new internal research program to allow us to investigate and further develop REIMS technology for potential future advanced medical procedures. This represents a different type of investment for Waters as we have historically concentrated our research efforts on product development plans that were more closely aligned with the needs of our existing customer base. However, we view the value of this new embodiment of mass spectrometry technology and its potential medical applications as sufficiently compelling to cause us to slightly alter our strategy and incrementally invest in this effort. In addition during the fourth quarter, we also acquired access to advanced mass spec technology to more broadly support long-term applications for our health science initiative.","So, in summarizing our fourth quarter results, I am very pleased with the level of top and bottom line growth that we delivered in a challenging currency environment. The strength in pharmaceutical spending in the second and third quarters continued nicely in the fourth. Our recurring revenues also grew impressively, indicating increased instrument utilization and demonstrating the strategic value in offering a full portfolio of technical services and superior column offerings. For our TA Instruments Division, the slower annual sales growth was primarily a function of weaker chemical industry spending. We feel that TA has a strong pipeline of new products that will drive growth in its core business in 2015 and beyond.","Before looking to the future, I want to note that we generated record free cash flow in 2014, including a $115 million in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to 2015, we believe that market conditions will be as good as or potentially better than those in 2014 supported by continued strong global pharmaceutical demand for our products. We are hopeful that business conditions in China will normalize and that our TA division will also grow at a rate that is more aligned with its historical performance. Gene will provide you with a more detailed 2015 outlook shortly.","On the product side and for the Waters Division, we will continue to benefit from the rapid uptake of recently introduced strategic instrument platforms. In addition, at our upcoming technical conferences, we look forward to introducing new products and programs to benefit 2015 sales growth.","Well, before turning you over to Gene, I would like to say a few words about our non-operational plans. In 2015, we expect another year of strong free cash flow and anticipate continued capital deployment toward our share repurchase program. On the M&A front, it is highly unlikely that you will see us in pursuit of a major acquisition and more likely that we will continue to target smaller bolt-on businesses and technical acquisitions. On a more personal note, the search for my replacement continues and I feel we have made significant progress in terms of candidate identification and development to complete this process in roughly the same timeframe as I have originally put forward.","So, on closing, I want to reiterate my confidence in our focused business strategy, the discipline that we have demonstrated now over a couple of decades of primarily growing our business organically has enabled us to have industry leading ROIC and consistently higher operating margins and cash flow. Our results in 2014 confirm the advantages of this strategy. Our employees have been and will continue to be a significant competitive advantage for Waters. They embody and reflect our business strategy and their focused commitment to be the best at what they do in order to ensure our customer success. I personally appreciate their efforts and feel privileged to oversee this great organization.","Now, here is Gene for a review of our fourth quarter financials.","Gene Cassis","Well, thank you very much, Doug and good afternoon all. As Doug mentioned, our fourth quarter sales grew by 8% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales by 5% resulting in 3% overall sales growth. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share were up 17% to $1.99 this quarter and that\u2019s up from $1.70 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.80 for the quarter versus $1.65 last year. Attached to this morning\u2019s press release, you can find a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings.","Looking at our top line geographically before foreign currency exchange effects, sales within the United States and Europe will reach up 10%. Our growth in Asia outside of Japan was up 8% and in Japan again before currency translation sales were flat with last year. On the product front and in constant currency, Waters Division instrument system sales increased by 9% and recurring revenues grew by 11%. Within our TA Instruments Division, total sales decreased by 5% in comparison to a strong quarter last year.","Now, I\u2019d like to comment on our fourth quarter non-GAAP financial performance. Gross margins came in at 60.1%, up from 59.5% in the prior year as the benefits of higher sales volume and positive mix dynamics offset the negative foreign currency headwinds. Moving down to P&L, SG&A expenses were up 3% on a constant currency basis. The impact of currency translation reduced this growth slightly. R&D expenses, including ongoing spending associated with the medical initiative that Doug had mentioned, increased by 7% again before foreign currency translation.","On the tax front, our full year operating tax rate came in at 13%. This rate was lower than what we had expected due to the positive effects of higher sales volume in lower tax locations and a $2 million benefit realized as the United States R&D tax credit was reestablished in the fourth quarter. Applying its full year rate to our cumulative earnings moved our effective fourth quarter operating tax rate to 10%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $7.6 million and our average share count came in at around 84 million shares, about 2 million shares lower than in the 2013 quarter. This is a result of our continued share repurchase programs.","On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled close to $2.1 billion and debt totaled close to $1.5 billion bringing us to a net cash position of about $590 million. As for the quarter\u2019s share repurchases, we bought 655,000 shares of our common stock for $74 million. This leaves $769 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase programs. We define free cash as cash from operations less capital expenditures, plus any non-cash benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. Our fourth quarter generated healthy free cash flow at about $150 million after funding $21 million for capital expenditures, a level which does not include $2 million of spending associated with major facility construction.","Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 68 days this quarter, down 1 day from fourth quarter last year and sequentially down 5 days from the third quarter. In the quarter, inventories declined by $23 million in comparison to the third quarter. So, for the full year, 2014 sales grew about 6% before currency effects, while currency translation reduced sales growth by nearly 2 percentage points. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted shares were up around 9% to $5.47 per share versus $5.04 last year. Notably, currency translation reduced earnings by about $0.22 versus the prior year, somewhat masking the more impressive organic operating leverage of our business.","Looking ahead to 2015, our outlook assumes a continuation of the market conditions that we saw in 2014. Specifically, we are envisioning stable increases in our recurring revenue sales, in combination with continued growth in our sales for our broadly defined pharmaceutical sector. We feel these factors and a return to growth for our TA Instruments Division will combined to help support a mid-single digit organic sales increase in 2015. Currency at today\u2019s rates is expected to reduce 2015 sales growth by about 4%.","Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2014, as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. We expect to manage our constant currency operating sales expenses to grow at a rate that is less than our constant currency sales growth rate. Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $31 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be between 13% and 13.5% next year. This rate assumes that the U.S. R&D tax credit that benefited 2014 by about half a point will not be available in 2015.","We plan to continue our share repurchase program throughout this year and we want to do that at a rate that will result in an average diluted share count of about 83 million shares. Rolling all of this together and again, on a non-gap basis, full year 2015 earnings per fully diluted share are projected to be within a range of $5.55 to $5.80.","Looking at the first quarter of 2015, we are estimating that sales will grow at a high-single digit rate due to a relatively favorable base of comparison and for additional business days in the quarter. Currency translation at today\u2019s rates is expected to reduce first quarter sales growth by about 5%. Rolling all these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of between $0.95 and $1.05. Doug?","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you, Gene. At this point operator, I think we can open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is now open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Can you comment on the book to bill in China, were booking is greater than revenue growth?","Gene Cassis","Sure. I mean, I think that we ended up seeing a significant backlog, a reduction as we closed the year out. We did see throughout the year a little bit of build in terms of the order rate. So, it seems that the order rate was improving, but one of the big dynamics that worked in our favor in the fourth quarter was that funds were available to allow us to complete some shipments against the order backlog that we had come into the quarter with.","Douglas Berthiaume","Dan, you will recall that in we faced two separate issues in China. And I think most people are seeing this is that delays in actually getting the process of orders to the point where they can be viewed as a legitimate purchase order. And then even once the purchase order is received, the banking system slowdowns of getting money authorized to support a shipment were slow. We clearly saw some progress on that flow of money. So, we think we are beginning on those scores to see some breakthrough, but we are reluctant to believe that it\u2019s fully something that we can forecast improving is in the short-term. So, that\u2019s the state of the state.","Dan Leonard","Got it. And then my follow-up question, Gene, can you quantify the EPS, negative EPS impacts from foreign currency in your 2015 guidance?","Gene Cassis","Well, yes, I think as we had mentioned earlier that in 2014 the effect of foreign currency reduced the growth in EPS by about 4 percentage points. And looking at where rates are right now, we expect that, that impact will be a little bit greater, maybe a couple of points greater in 2015. Now, we have seen some pretty dramatic swings in currency lately. So, it\u2019s unclear whether the rates that we are seeing now are really going to be the rates that we deal with throughout the year, but if we do use the current rates and look at our projected mix of sales, that\u2019s where we think \u2013 what we think the impact will be.","Dan Leonard","Understood. Thank you.","Gene Cassis","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Either Doug or Gene, can you talk about the incremental spending around REIMS? You kind of alluded to maybe stepping up some of the efforts there, understanding obviously you want to grow expenses less than revenues, but how should we think about the incremental investment?","Douglas Berthiaume","You want to\u2026","Gene Cassis","Yes, I can start off. I mean, it\u2019s we actually did start to fund a program during the fourth quarter and we are looking within the fourth quarter, there were about a couple of million dollars worth of R&D spend that we can attribute to that program. So, you can look at that as sort of maybe a base rate going forward that will likely build off of. So, hopefully that gives you a little feel for what the level of investment is as we move into this year.","Tycho Peterson","Okay.","Douglas Berthiaume","And we have looked at the opportunity to accelerate that program, Tycho. You are talking about a program that could look at accelerated spending in the $5 million to $10 million annual level. We think we have some ways to look at programs that can contribute to not making that totally felt in the P&L, but to the extent, we are willing to bet on that that\u2019s all reflected in the guidance that Gene provided.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then separately the pharma growth you have seen has been notable and seems broad-based, can you maybe just talk about how much of this is a function replacement cycle really hitting its stride, how much of it is from QDa uptake or alternatively share gains, other factors you may want to call out?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, I think it\u2019s probably all of those. Certainly, the QDa has been very successful, but it certainly didn\u2019t add up to the 8 to 10 points of organic growth. It may have contributed 1 point of that. We have \u2013 I have been talking about the pent-up replacement demand for a while and some people believe that others didn\u2019t. I think we are seeing some of that as some anecdotal evidence that the industry went through so much pulling back that it was inevitable that at some point we would see some contribution as a result of pent-up replacement demand. We see some evidence of that. But we are seeing a big return to growth in India that we had a couple of years of repressed growth. I think most of that\u2019s kind of macroeconomic and regulatorily inspired. We are seeing very good response in the biotech segment of the marketplace, that\u2019s particularly vibrant area. And we are not seeing any reduction coming out of the top 20, 30 pharmaceutical customers. It certainly stopped being a drag in our growth. So and also again there is a piece here or a piece there, another piece is the strength that we are seeing on our informatics platform, to some extent that represents big pharma continuing to upgrade their information networks. But it also reflects the investments that we have made in the new unified platform and the response to that has been good both at the instrument level and at the larger network information level. So they were all contributing.","Tycho Peterson","Can you quantify what\u2019s embedded in guidance for pharma for this year?","Gene Cassis","Yes. I mean as we look at pharma as the broadly defined pharmaceutical, it\u2019s being more than half of our business. We are assuming in our guidance that pharmaceutical growth rate is at the corporate mid-single digit growth. It\u2019s slower than we saw in the fourth quarter, so if we are lucky and the world stays the way it\u2019s going now, there is some opportunity there.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thanks. And I will hop back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Douglas Berthiaume","Hi Doug.","Doug Schenkel","So within the Waters Division it was very solid, a pretty balanced beat in the fourth quarter. One of the biggest drivers looks to have been services though which continue to trend for the year. And I am making an educated guess because we don\u2019t have precise numbers yet, but it looks like Waters Division services may have grown about 9% year-over-year constant currency and this follows a pretty strong 2013, which again was better than the division average. I am just wondering if you would talk us through what\u2019s driving such robust services growth to rates that exceeds Waters instruments and Waters chemistry. And how would you describe sustainability and I guess while I am on the topic could you just talk us through the current margin profile of the Waters Division services?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, maybe I can handle the strategic question and Gene can jump in on the profitability. Yes, Doug, the \u2013 we have been doing very well in the Waters services you would find that the bulk of our high growth comes from planned development, as we instruments particularly these sophisticated systems that compass not only LC, but mass spectrometry and informatics, chemistry solutions. As we have shifted to pushing instrument systems, we find that the growth in plans extended plans has been very high. The beauty of this strategy is that they stay somewhat immune to outside forces such as third-party. Customers invest very heavily in our services and support to keep that going. Embedded within those plans are a lot of compliance services as well informatics services. So that has been exceptionally healthy and it makes up a very large portion of the growth.","On top of that, our services also consist of a fairly large parts business. And as you build your base and you keep on getting your install base moving, the amount of instruments going into the base versus instruments being retired just it exceeds that retirement and we see this increasing momentum. So for us the services business is very strong. We feed it with new products and services. We feed the organization in terms of manpower to keep it supported. So for us it\u2019s a perpetuating strength and we feel that our strategy keeps it fairly well contained within the confines of the Waters\u2019 infrastructure and doesn\u2019t allow too much outside force to come in and disrupted us. As you have pointed out, this performance has been pretty consistent not only over the last couple of years, but over many, many years. I mean, this was a particularly good year, but it hasn\u2019t varied downward by more than a couple of points. So, it\u2019s one of the reasons of this strong consistent kind of definable growth. Gene, do you want to talk about the profitability in that business?","Gene Cassis","Sure. If we take a look at our \u2013 our service business is a very attractive business for us. Interestingly at the gross margin line, it\u2019s probably slightly dilutive. A lot of the costs that we have are labor costs are the people that we have in the field. But if you look at it at the operating margin line, it is accretive to the corporation\u2019s operating margin, in the same way the chemistry business is. So, it\u2019s certainly something that as it becomes a bigger part of our mix, it does have a positive effect on our operating income.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thanks for all of that. Very interesting and helpful. And I think somewhat related to that and I guess as my follow-up, if we look down below the revenue line into the expense line, you talked a little bit about R&D and that picked up a little bit in this quarter and if you actually factor in FX, it probably increased a decent amount. And I think for good reason most of us would agree that the incremental investment in REIMS in the clinical side. At the SG&A line, you increased, I think it was 1% year-over-year on a reported basis, on reported revenue growth of north of 3%, organic growth of I think close to 8%. On the surface, this actually seems a little bit light. I am just wondering is there anything to point to you in terms of product or geographic mix? I mean, this as you have just described, Gene, could relate to the higher services mix, is there a timing issue? I guess really what I am getting at is, is this the type of leverage that we can expect as we think about 2015 moving forward over the next few quarters? Thank you.","Gene Cassis","It\u2019s interesting, Doug, that if we look over the past five quarters, four of them have been pretty impressive in terms of the organic growth rate. And if I think about the guidance that we had for next year of mid single-digit top line growth, there really is not a lot of SG&A leverage that\u2019s assumed within that growth rate. And that\u2019s one of the factors that was considered when we gave you the guidance on the EPS line. Now, the one thing is that we typically have a base growth \u2013 a base growth of our expenses at the 3% or 4% level. And so if you look at some of the results that we have delivered in recent quarters, we have been very good at controlling expenses. But again businesses grow nicely and we have to make investments, specifically in our field service operation to make sure that we continue to support our customer base. So, I would just say that I think we have been conservative in our guidance in the amount of leverage that we forecasted for 2015.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thanks again. Stay safe and stay warm.","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you, Doug.","Operator","Our next question will come from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Just want to ask a question about the impact of falling oil prices. It seems sort of like sort of a very topical thing and while I understand it\u2019s not the biggest end market you have just maybe what your expectations are just given the energy CapEx in a lot of areas is going to be down most likely 25% or 30% this year. Just trying to get a sense of how you think that will impact your business on a net basis given all the puts and takes?","Douglas Berthiaume","Isaac, not very much, directly to the petroleum industry, our sales are miniscule. It probably matters more to the industrial chemical segment as their feed stocks go down in cost, maybe it stimulates some of their spending. So, that\u2019s probably a longer term dynamic if the cost of those petroleum derived feed stocks go down, but I don\u2019t think you will notice the decline in the cost of energy from a revenue point of view nearly at all conceivable, because we sell to other divisions within the big oil companies that might have some small derivative effect, but I would not anticipate that. And as a consumer of energy, it\u2019s likely that our costs, particularly freight costs could be meaningfully reduced, remains to be seen, but I would anticipate that.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thank you. And then just to follow-up on the tax rate for this year, it sounded like even without the R&D tax credit, tax rate this year should be down a little bit. And if I went back the clock maybe 18 months ago, there was some concern that maybe a little bit of tax credit to the upside. So just maybe the reasons why tax rate looks like it will be at least in line if not better this year?","Gene Cassis","Well, I think some of the reasons why we have seen some favorable moves in tax rate of course some of the products that we manufacture in Singapore and Ireland did very well on the revenue side. And also we have a more significant component of the TA mix that\u2019s U.S. manufactured. So, as the shift moved a little bit more towards the Waters Division that was beneficial to our tax rate. I think that we are looking at product mix and geographical mix for this year, 2015, to be similar to 2014. And we are not discounting the chance that we get another R&D tax credit from the United States government, but we haven\u2019t taken that to the bank. So, we are I think realistic in the 13% outlook for this year and I think there could be some upside, but when you have tax rates that vary from the very favorable rate that we have in Singapore to the mid to high 30s that we have in the United States, it doesn\u2019t take much of a shift in terms of geographic and product mix to move tax rates around for us.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Okay, thanks guys. Go Patriots.","Gene Cassis","Thank you, Isaac.","Operator","Our next question will come from Miroslava Minkova with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Miroslava Minkova","Hi, good afternoon. Let me just start with Europe. It has been very strong \u2013 impressively strong for you in the fourth quarter and over the course of \u201814, how do you think about \u201815 in Europe in particular as well as given the mix of economic headlines that keep flowing from the continent?","Douglas Berthiaume","The headlines are probably no more fearsome than they were through most of this year, Miroslava. We are certainly watchful as we began the year. Our organization was a little bit more optimistic I would say than we were and then they performed better than even that optimistic level. I think underlying it still comes down to the strength in the pharmaceutical sector that when you cut through all the noise, the pharmaceutical sector marches to a drummer that\u2019s different than the Greek crisis or the Spanish crisis or something like that. So, probably the surprising thing that held up was the academic and government sector not only in Europe, but specifically there where we saw good results through most of the year. So, there is one area that we continue to monitor it\u2019s that, but of course, the pharmaceutical segment is by far the most important dynamic.","Miroslava Minkova","Right, thank you.","Douglas Berthiaume","As that points out to me, the new products did well all over, but did particularly well in Europe both the new mass spec products and the QDa received a very strong push from our European results.","Miroslava Minkova","Okay, great. That\u2019s great commentary. And on the TA division, I appreciate it was a weak comp \u2013 I am sorry, a tough comp this quarter. Are you assuming that it will rebound as we go over the course of \u201815 or could there be a period of when chemical customers might be seeing some leftover pressure? Help us understand the cadence of the TA revenues.","Douglas Berthiaume","I would say we are quite confident that the results will be better than we saw in the fourth quarter. There is the confluence of events that saw a mid-single digit decline in organic revenue. We have examined that very closely and think that the events they are quite definable. And as we look at a number of underlying dynamics coming out as in 2015, we are confident that that\u2019s not likely to be repeated. Early indications albeit early in the first month of the New Year are indicative that that momentum has definitely improved. So, we are not being overly confident, but the mid-single digit kind of level that Gene has talked about, we think is doable in this coming year.","Miroslava Minkova","Okay, great. Thank you so much. Stay away from the storm.","Douglas Berthiaume","I don\u2019t think we are going to be able to do that.","Operator","Our next questions here will come from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Amanda Murphy","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So, just, I guess I had a follow-up on Tycho\u2019s question earlier on the replacement cycle. So and this maybe a hard one to answer, but I am just curious if you take the broad sort of LC install base and then the LC\/MS install base, is there a way to think about the aging there more generally, so I am just trying to get a magnitude of what a replacement cycle might look like on both sides, is it 10% of the install base, it\u2019s right for an upgrade or 20%, any sense of how that might look and\u2026?","Douglas Berthiaume","Art, do you want to shelter on that?","Art Caputo","Interestingly, on the LC side of the business, what we have been experiencing over the last few years has been somewhat the opposite. The cycle used to run 7 years pretty consistently. They seem to be \u2013 accounts seem to be stretching the cycles out on the LC side. In some cases, 8, 9, 10 years on the core basic traditional equipment. What we have had that has been offsetting that is the strategy that basically adds to that equipment. So, when you look at products likely the QDa and other add-on types of capabilities that we supply our upgrades, we look to offset those increased replacement cycles with additional capabilities which has worked out quite well for us on the HPLC side. Totally separate from that cycle, we do continue to see UPLC transition and replace some of the HPLC business. So, it\u2019s not necessarily replacement cycle as much as it is than upgrade cycle. So, the dynamics are in a straightforward as a continuous where at replace. There are some other things going on and we try to manage that.","The cycles on mass spectrometry are very different from LC side. It\u2019s not yet fully matured out. There are still a lot of increases, performance going on across various types of mass spectrometers. On top of that, as I mentioned, we have added some capabilities with the QDa where we are trying to add HPLC detection. So, the mass spectrometry cycles tends to be much shorter where new capabilities will induce people to replace or expand at a much faster rate. So, we enjoy a much more vibrant activity on the mass spectrometry side which plays well for us.","And I would add one more thing and that is that, with Waters, the biggest leverage we have in the marketplace is we have a very strong lead position in the separations business. We have a strong lead position in mass spectrometry and we compound this leverage by continually looking at the new applications and new capabilities trying to create new markets, new segments. The health sciences area is a classic where we are constantly bumping into new problems that need to be solved as people move from the discovery phase into this translational medicine phase. So, we can\u2019t really talk about a one-size-fits-all in the broad scheme of how we manage the business. We have it segmented into multiple components across the company. When we put it all together over the last few years, we are really seeing it start to work and that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s driving the growth on a global basis for us.","Amanda Murphy","On the HPLC side, are you seeing that 8 to 9 years come down a bit then or is it still running at about that 8 to 9 years?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, one or two quarters is a little bit too hard to call. I think intuitively we are beginning to see a little bit of what I\u2019d call pent-up replacement demand largely from the pharmaceutical industry who has pushed off this replacement cycle and dealt with reducing headcount. So, I think that has to account for some of our growth that\u2019s disproportionate with the industry\u2019s growth. So, we are so strong in the pharmaceutical market.","Amanda Murphy","Got it. And then just one quick one on the column side of the business, so I need you to say that the attach rate for UPLC was pretty high sort of 80% to 90%, so are you still seeing that? I know you have had some new products there and so curious if you are still seeing that and also is there a risk to that going forward?","Douglas Berthiaume","The UPLC attach rate continues to grow. It\u2019s growing at a rate faster than the rest of our HPLC lines and we continue to extend that capability by adding new chemical moieties to the substrate and new products. So, the UPLC column business is quite a success story for and it continues to expand. And we see very little competition attacking that specific performance range in the chemistry line.","Gene Cassis","Yes. And Amanda, I think the attach rate continues to be very robust in the ballpark that you spoke about. I think the big opportunity that still I think is largely in front of us. But as we begin to see more migration of UPLC technology into quality control applications, we think we have a wonderful reputation for quality of these column chemistries for the people who develop methods. And if the past is any indication of what the future would bring that, that\u2019s a great place to be once the new methodology goes into quality control.","Douglas Berthiaume","And that\u2019s when these new drugs though we develop using UPLC come into quality control, but they are still not into the mainstream of that process yet.","Amanda Murphy","Got it. Thanks guys.","Gene Cassis","Thank you.","Operator","Question will come from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Gene, quickly on the currency for next year, can you walk us through how you get to the negative 4% headwind on the revenue line, exactly what the spot rates are that you are assuming from our end maybe close to\u2026.","Gene Cassis","In general, if I think about the currency story for 2014, it was largely a yen-based story. But as we look at 2015, there is going to be a significant contribution to the top line from the diminished value of the euro and we continue to see some drag for the yen. If I look at sort of the rates that we are looking at for the first quarter, we are looking at a euro that\u2019s at about the $1.13 level, a yen at the $1.17, $1.18 level and on the cost side for us a pound and this works little bit in our favor at $1.50.","Brandon Couillard","Great. And for the full year, you are assuming basically today\u2019s rates to get the down\u2026","Gene Cassis","Yes. I mean, that\u2019s who knows what it\u2019s going to be. And all we can tell you is that listen, if grades are approximately what they are today, this is where the impact is going to be and we are not forecasting how rates are going to move through the year.","Brandon Couillard","Okay. And then one more on the outlook, could you give us a feel for the CapEx and operating cash flow?","Gene Cassis","Yes, I think on the CapEx side that the big investment opportunity that we have made in recent years is of course on new mass spectrometry facility in Wilmslow and in the later part of this year, we fully occupied that site. And I really don\u2019t see anything on the near-term horizon that\u2019s going to be a large consumer of capital expenditures. So, we are going to go back more towards a maintenance type of a cap level. I think if you saw what the capital expenditure was in the fourth quarter it was in the mid 20s. I mean, maybe projecting that out and thinking of capital expenditures that for the full year might be in the $70 million or $75 million might be a good estimate of what CapEx will like this year.","Douglas Berthiaume","I think with a free cash flow next year it should be around the $500 million level.","Gene Cassis","Yes.","Brandon Couillard","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Question will come from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and thanks for braving the storm out there. I really just like to focus a little bit on China. I wonder if you could first give us a sense for what kind of growth you are assuming in China over the course of \u201815 in the company\u2019s overall revenue guidance? And then I wonder Doug if you could reflect a bit more on the comments that you made earlier about the outlook in China. It sounds like and you guys have been pretty consistent on this point, you have seen incrementally positive signs, but you are not willing to call for a really sustained recovery there. Are there specifics that you could point us to or is it more about maybe a mixed picture in terms of certain parts of China as an end market some better, more worse? Thanks so much.","Gene Cassis","Yes. Well, I will start off talking about our assumptions for growth in China in 2015. China represents something in the neighborhood of 12% of our sales. And what we saw from the full year on the sales growth for 2014 was very close to flat or just a tiny bit of growth for that business. We think that both looking at the momentum on the order side as well as the shipment side, there is some reason for optimism. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unrealistic to think about China as growing at around the corporate average for next year, so a mid single-digit top line growth rate against what is going to be a tremendously favorable base of comparison is a good base case scenario for us.","Douglas Berthiaume","And Steve, I think as you look and try to read the tea leaves in China, this dual track of how orders get processed and then how the financial systems fund that has been something that we face through most of the year in China. And at various times, we saw a little bit of progress on the order side and relatively little flexibility on the financial funding side. The thing \u2013 and I would say roughly we saw maybe a little bit better orders performance in the fourth quarter than we had expected, but we saw real progress with the financial system in being able to fund orders that had been previously booked. And so what begets what in China, I think is a fair question. Does the shutdown of the financial funding lead to reduced orders or kind of different things working on both sides of the equation? We take it as a positive that the funding has improved and our local organization clearly sees that.","If you look at the projects and the underlying demand that we are seeing from customers and thought leaders in China, nothing has changed. They are still looking for \u2013 you would assume that the boom was still going in China. If you look at the underlying requests, the demand for new capabilities in the multimillion dollar projects that they continue to talk to us about. So if you gauge interest at that level, you would say wow, 2015 is going to be a robust year. So, we try to gauge all of that. I would say from a top down perspective, we don\u2019t see how the cork can be held in the order side of this genie for too much longer. There just appears to be the opportunity to be bursting at the seam. We have an excellent organization in China. I have compared to anyone else in the life science tools business, its top of the grade and its long service unlike a lot of organizations in China. So, it\u2019s been through the mill. And so, we are pretty optimistic, its business in these dynamics turns it all. We are going to be there to grab a hold of it, that\u2019s why we think this mid-single digit approach is more likely to offer us the opportunity to grow faster. The question is will it come earlier or later. So, it wouldn\u2019t surprise us if they were better than that, but it\u2019s awfully hard to bank on that at this point of time.","Steve Beuchaw","Perfect. That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thanks so much and get home safe guys.","John Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Bryan Brokmeier","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Doug you stated earlier in the call that you expect the TA Division to up in 2015, but the fourth quarter looks like it was the weakest quarter of the year. Is that because of an easy comp next year that you expect pick up or new products that you plan to launch this year or is there something that you are seeing now that gives you the confidence that it will improve?","Douglas Berthiaume","I will let Gene\u2019s start and since Gene is very tied of this division. Gene, you want to\u2026","Gene Cassis","Sure, sure. I think that there is a confluence of activities happening this year that are going to work favorably for the TA Instruments group. If you look at the long-term growth rate of that business on the top line, it\u2019s been the solid high-single digit grower. Now, a component of that has been acquired businesses. And I think in 2015, what you are going to see is a nice delivery of some of the businesses that we have acquired more recently. We do have some new core products that will be coming to the market mid-year. So, we should have some second half of the year positive impact from those launches. And as you already mentioned, I think in comparison to prior year is this basic comparison affords us an opportunity to show some nice growth. I think that the pipeline looks excellent where both new products for the TA Instruments Division and as you begin to look at some of the customer dynamics, it looks like there is a lot of building interest in some of the newer product launches from that group that will begin to show their positive effects throughout this year.","Douglas Berthiaume","And as I said Bryan that, we can already see and I am normally reluctant to take January results to the bank and I\u2019m certainly not going to go hard at this, but already in the January timeframe, we are seeing very good strong indications of better performance coming.","Bryan Brokmeier","Okay. Thanks. And another question is, is the money you are spending on your health science initiatives and it\u2019s relatively immaterial or is it at the expense of investments in your core platforms or are you offsetting those investments with reductions in spending outside of R&D?","Douglas Berthiaume","It\u2019s not so much \u2013 well, first of all, independent of this decision, we continue to drive productivity programs. And so, we do that every year and we are doing it in 2015. So, we fully expect particularly in administrative and in science support areas to be able to grow our sales faster than we grow the support spending. With the health science initiative, independently, we looked at that and said while the payoff is not likely to be in 2015, the opportunity, the clear outsize opportunity that we have here means that we should spend faster to get there. And so, we made the decision to do that in our plan.","We also have some initiatives probably three or four separate initiatives that we think will pay-off and added operating benefits. Anyone of which might not have happen, but taken in total, we think will contribute towards minimizing the overall P&L pain, not all of it, but it will mean that we can offset some of this increased spending. So that\u2019s probably the most I want to say about it. But it\u2019s \u2013 we are not trying to rob Peter to pay Paul.","Bryan Brokmeier","Alright. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Dan Arias","Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Just one question for me, Doug or Gene in thinking about the margin runway, how do you guys see your ability for new product to be additive to gross margins. Just curious about the extent to which this happens and then whether that\u2019s something that you sort of aim for explicitly when you are thinking about adding products to the portfolio?","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, it\u2019s interesting that typically when you have a new product launch the short-term impact until the volumes ramp is it has a little bit of a drag on gross margins. But I will take a look at some of the programs that we have introduced more recently in QDa and our new tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. I think we have done an excellent job in engineering these products to be accretive to the gross margin. So I mean it clearly is something that we are focused on especially for products where we know that there is a large market and you have a lot of initial market receptivity like the QDa, like our new tandem quadrupole. So and again we talked about this earlier in the call is the positive impact that our recurring revenues have on our gross margins and operating margins going forward and that\u2019s an important driver of our future profitability.","John Lynch","Operator, I have noticed the time and the conditions I think we could probably limit it to one more question.","Operator","Okay, great. Our next question will come from Jeff Elliott with Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Elliott","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in and just one quick one here. Doug, when you look at the fourth quarter, what\u2019s your sense, was any of this revenue pulled ahead from the first quarter perhaps in the pharma side or were there any large orders in the academic side?","Douglas Berthiaume","Jeff, the clearest indication of a pull forward and I have \u2013 it\u2019s not often, but I can\u2019t say that in 20 plus years of doing this, I haven\u2019t seen some indications of major pull forwards. But I would say the clearest indication is that you see this big bolus of orders in the latter part of December and then you see orders fall off the cliff early on in January. Let me say that we clearly haven\u2019t seen that. I am certainly encouraged by the kind of early momentum that we have seen in 2015. So it\u2019s not a guarantee that it continues at a very high level, but I will say it\u2019s very indicative that we didn\u2019t empty the bucket in December.","Jeff Elliott","Excellent. Thank you.","Douglas Berthiaume","You\u2019re welcome.","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, I want to thank you all. I appreciate you changing your schedules for this, who knows what the response would have been tomorrow. But we do appreciate it. And hopefully this is the last time we will have to change our schedule like this. We look forward to seeing you on a more rational schedule next quarter.

We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.","Briefly reviewing our financial highlights for the second quarter revenues grew 5% and adjusted earnings per share grew 11%. Overall I\u2019m pleased with the progress we made in the quarter demonstrating clear sequential improvement versus the first quarter and reinforcing the confidence we have in the ongoing growth trajectory of our business.","Highlights in the quarter included team\u2019s growth in China, double-digit growth from our DA product line and high single digit growth of recurring revenues. Looking briefly at the P&L we are pleased with the operating leverage we generated and the solid earnings results we realized in the quarter.","While investing in growth to organic innovation, we demonstrated disciplined operating expense management that drove margin expansion which enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth in the quarter.","Before I review our end market geographic and product line performance, I would like to provide an update on two factors we sited in last quarter\u2019s call that adversely impacted our first quarter, Mass Spectrometry in India.","First in Mass Spectrometry we saw a sequential improvement in the second quarter driven by solid growth from our core tandem portfolio. Our tandem quads which represent the majority of our mass spec sales have continue to sell strongly over the past year, offset by software growth from our high resolution mass spec product line. ","For further context, mass spec technologies are a key part of our LCMS and direct mass spec system offerings, yet represents a smaller part of our overall business and within mass spec high resolution mass spec represents only about quarter of the total mass spec revenue. ","Our sales force realignment, which had a minor impact our U.S. mass spec business during the first quarter is now complete and remains a key element of our ongoing market development strategy.","With respect to India, growth was flat in the second quarter with a return to growth in Pharma, partially offset by some weakness in industrial and governmental and academic. We remain confident in the improvement of our India business in the second half of the year as customers continue to regain purchasing momentum.","Now taking a closer look at the business starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level. Sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category grew 4% in the quarter, growth was driven by double-digit growth in China, partially offset by a slight decline in developed markets due to slower than expected budget releases by our largest Pharma customers. ","Importantly we saw strong year-over-year growth in our large molecule business. As we continue to leverage our refresh Xevo tandem quad portfolio in this high growth market, we feel good about our Pharma market position and in particular, our ability to meet the needs of our about molecule customers as their investment environment continues to be positive.","Sales to our worldwide industrial category which includes the materials characterization, food, environmental and fine chemical markets were up 3% in the quarter. Sales within our TA brand continued strong trend we have seen, giving us confidence in a positive outlook for industrial category as volume in our thermal and [indiscernible] product lines has been our best proxy for industrial end market demand.","We saw softer demand from food and environmental customers in the quarter, partially offset by strength in the chemical materials market. Despite the near-term puts and takes. We continue to be excited about our product positions and pipeline, as well as the breadth of opportunity across materials characterization, food safety and environmental applications.","Looking at our governmental and academic category, sales grew by 13% in the second quarter with broad-based growth across all major geographies. Weakness in biomedical research was more than offset by improvement in other research applications including pharmaceutical, materials and clinical diagnostics.","Next I will review our sales performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest region in terms of revenue was up 8% in the second quarter as strong midteens growth in China offset flat performance in India. Demand in China continues to be robust, with strong growth in Pharma, food and materials.","Turning to the Americas, overall sales grew 1% in the quarter with sales in the U.S. declining 2%. Although growth in Canada and Latin America was strong, including Brazil, Mexico and Puerto Rico, it was offset by some softness in the U.S., particularly in biomedical research markets as well as slower-than-expected Pharma growth.","In Europe, sales were up 5% in the quarter. Industrial, as well as government and academic were particularly strong in the region while European pharmaceutical growth was a bit softer driven mostly by tough comps in big Pharma.","Finally, I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instrument sales were flat in the second quarter, driven by the previously mentioned mass spec systems softness. On the other hand, we were pleased with our sales of standalone chromatography instruments.","Within LC the Acuity ARC continues to see significant broad-based demand and the newly launched Acuity Plus is receiving strong market acceptance. Our core tandem quad mass spec portfolio has sold really well over the last year, highlighted by the Xevo TQ-S micro and the Xevo TQ-XS.","In high resolution mass spec growth was challenged within the biomedical research market, we recognize we are currently in the latter phases of product cycle in high resolution mass spec and therefore face more competitive pressure than the rest of our portfolio.","That said, we continue to see significant growth opportunity in the space, are investing assertively and are confident in the strength of our technology pipelines that we expect will begin to show in the coming year. ","Waters branded recurring revenues, which reflect the combination of service and precision chemistries and represent approximately 50% of the total business grew 8% in the quarter. Recurring revenues were driven by global strength in our service sample prep and application kits and UPLC columns.","Turning to our TA product line, sales increased 12% in the quarter. Instrument sales for TA increased 12% and service sales increased 11% was. There was broad-based growth across our key thermal analysis, microcalorimeter and electroforce product lines.","In particular, growth within our discovery line of thermal analyzers continues to be very strong. We have now introduced nine new instruments over the past two years within the discovery series including the DMA 850, which was introduced earlier this year. Our balanced growth of new customers and existing customer upgrades gives us confidence that the discovery series continues to have a long runway ahead of it.","In summary, we are pleased that we saw sequential improvement in our second quarter results, highlighted by strong growth in China, our TA product line in our recurring revenues. In addition, we deliver meaningful operating leverage, which enabled us to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth. As always we remain steadfastly focused on executing to our five point value creation model","As we have previously communicated we aim to create shareholder value by first holding a focused and highly differentiated leadership position in structurally attractive markets. Second, executing a clear growth strategy driven by organic innovation. Third, seeking opportunity for continuous operational improvement, fourth being a disciplined capital allocator and fifth, operating with the performance oriented culture and management team. ","I would now like to add a few comments highlighting our strong focus on innovation at Waters. We are pleased with the progress of our product portfolio, including our recent interactions of the Acuity ARC Bio System, the Acuity UPLC Plus series and the Xevo TQGC as well as numerous new products for TA instruments business such as the recently launched DMA 850.","We continue to prioritize and invest proactively in organic innovation with second quarter R&D investment growing 9% year-over-year. I\u2019m personally excited about the rich pipeline, we are building across instruments informatics and precision chemistries.","To augment these internalizations, we are increasingly evaluating select external technologies to strengthen our overall product portfolio and enhance organically developed products. As an example, yesterday we announced the acquisition of portfolios Desorption Electrospray Ionization or DESI technology for mass spec imaging.","The acquisition of DESI technology bolsters Waters\u2019 market-leading portfolio of direct ionization mass spec, which also includes multi-REIMS and the [DAR] (Ph) QDa with live ID. These technologies allow for simplified direct sample analysis under ambient conditions without any required sample preparation.","We are excited about our unique ability to providing advance digital molecular imaging solutions and related analytical tools to researchers who strive to answer complex biological questions. In fact, my recent visit to a ASMS reinforced to me the excitement of the research community for mass spec imaging technologies, we saw 18 oral presentations and 105 poster presentations.","When coupled with our Xevo G2-XS QTof in SYNAPT G2-Si Mass Spectrometer, DESI provides maximum flexibility by leveraging the power of time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis and for more demanding applications additional or orthogonal resolution using Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry.","Importantly DESI is highly complementary to other imaging modalities, such as MALDI, making it a strategic addition to our evolving imaging portfolio and positioning Waters as the market leader in direct ionization mass spec techniques.","With that, I would like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of the second quarter financials. Sherry.","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris and morning everyone quarter. In the second quarter, we recorded net sales of $596 million an increase of approximately 5% in constant currency. ","Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 2%, resulting in 7% sales growth as reported. In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical markets grew 4%, sales into our industrial markets increased 3% and sales into our governmental and academic markets grew 13%.","Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue grew 8% in the quarter and instruments sales grew 2%. ","As we noted last quarter, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters, but there is one additional calendar day in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2017.","Breaking product sales down further, sales related to Waters\u2019 branded products and services grew 4% while sales of TA branded products grew 12%. Combined LC and LCMS instrument platform sales were flat and TA instrumentation systems sales grew 12%. Our total recurring revenues associated with both Waters and TA products grew 8%.","As Chris already shared, we are encouraged by the strong momentum that we have seen from TA in the first half of the year, which gives us confidence in the positive outlook for our industrial category.","Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically and on a constant currency basis, sales in the Americas were up 1%, but sales in the U.S. down 2%. European sales were up 5% and sales in Asia were up 8%, led by 14% growth in China.","Now I would like to comment on our second quarter non GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2% versus 58.9% in the second quarter of 2017, positively impacted by mix and FX.","Moving down the second quarter P&L. Operating expenses were up approximately 3% on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation increased operating expense growth by approximately 3% on a reported basis.","In the quarter our effective operating tax rate was 14.7% up 280 basis points year-over-year which was in line with our expectation and reflects the net impact on U.S. Tax Reform that we discussed in our Q4 2017 earnings call.","Net interest expense was $3 million down $3 million from the prior year benefiting from the reduced debt levels as part of our capital allocation framework, as well as higher rates of return on investments versus the prior year.","Our average share count came in at 78.4 million shares or approximately 2.3 million shares lower in the second quarter of last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Our non GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter were up 11% to a $95 and compression to earnings of a $76 last year. On a GAAP basis our earnings per share were $98 versus a $63 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non GAAP earnings is attached to the press release as of this morning.","Turning to free cash flow capital allocation and our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our second quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations with capital expenditures and excluding special items.","In the second quarter of 2018, free cash flow came in at a $44 million after funding $21 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow were $47 million for U.S. Tax Reform payments a $15 million payment for litigation settlement and $2 million related to the investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry Operation.","Just as a reminder on the U.S. Tax Reform, we incurred a $550 million GAAP tax expense charge in Q4 of 2017 primarily associated with the transition tax on earnings and profits outside the U.S. This tax liability is expected to be paid over eight years with the first payment of $47 million remitted in this quarter.","The lower free cash flow generation in the second quarter as compared to the prior year is impacted by a change in the timing of our current year U.S. estimated tax payments. We anticipate our free cash flow will normalize by the end of the year. Year-to-date 2018, we have converted $0.27 of each dollars up sales into free cash flow.","In terms of returns to shareholders in the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock for $271 million. These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow resulted in cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion and debt of $1.1 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, resulting in a net cash position of $1.1 billion.","Accounts receivable, days-sales-outstanding stood at 75 days this quarter which is the same as in the second quarter of last year. In the quarter, inventories increased by approximately 13 million in comparison to the prior year quarter which was in line with typical seasonal pattern.","As we look forward to the balance of the year, I would like to comment on our full-year 2018 guidance. Our outlook assume continued global growth and demand from our pharmaceutical end markets, year-over-year growth in our industrial market and consistent growth in our recurring revenues.","These dynamics along with the sequential improvements that we saw in our second quarter performance support the full-year 2018 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 4% to 6%. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to increase 2018 sales growth by less than 1% which is the change from our prior 2018 guidance that assumed a benefit of 2% to 3%.","Gross margin guidance for the year is unchanged at 58.5% to 59%. Our plan for the full-year is to continue managing operating expense growth at a rate that is below our sales growth rate. moving below the operating line net interest expense is expected to be approximately $14 million this assumes that the debt repaid in the first half of 2018 is not reborrowed during the course of the year.","The full-year tax rate tax guidance is unchanged and an effective tax rate of 13% to 15%. Regarding capital allocation our guidance assume a continuance of our share repurchase program at a level that will result in an average diluted share count of about 78.5 million shares outstanding.","Rolling all this together on a non GAAP basis full-year 2018 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $8.05 to $8.20 which is revision from our previous range of $8.10 to $8.30. At current rates, the foreign currency impact on the full-year earnings per share growth is expected to be neutral, which is the change from the prior 2018 guidance that assumed a benefit of about 1%.","Looking at the third quarter of 2018, we expect 4% to 6% constant currency sales growth. At today\u2019s rate, currency translation is expected to decrease third quarter sales growth by about 1% to 2%.","Combining these top line factors with a moderate increase in expenses, we estimate third quarter non GAAP earnings per diluted share in a range of $85 to $95 which assumes an approximately 3% negative impact in currency translation at current rates.","Now I would like to turn the call back to Chris.","Christopher O'Connell","Great. Thank you, Sherry. To recap. After a slower than expected starts to 2018, we were resolved to deliver a solid second quarter and I'm pleased that we delivered 5% revenue growth and 11% earnings per share growth. ","We made good progress in the parts of the business that held us back in the first quarter and we benefited from a number of key areas of strength that we will continue to leverage in the back half the year. As such, we expect our constant currency revenue growth for the back half of 2018 to be stronger than the first-half of the year.","With that said, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not always able to get to everyone's questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and if you have additional questions, please contact Waters\u2019 investor relations team after the call. Operator. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today will be from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","SteveBeuchaw","Chris first of all I would say thanks for preempting my first question, there at the end of your prepared remarks. I think what people really focus here is the drivers of the confidence and the outlook for the back half. So thanks for after thanks for going that proactively.","I wonder if you could, maybe go into even a little bit more detail on just a couple of components there. Number one, is India, can you talk to us in a little bit more granularity on what you are seeing that gives you comfort from the ground level there about who the drivers are for the improved confidence and spending patterns of your customer base there in India.","And the second piece of the back half, I would love to get just a little bit more on, is the sales force you mentioned that the sales force, the key positions in that filled people or in their seats, how recently did that happened and how much of an impact that have on 2Q.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, thanks Steve for the questions. First of all in India, I guess the way I would characterize it is that the caution that we saw in our first quarter, which is, as we talked last quarter was the final quarter of the year for Indian pharmaceutical companies.","The caution that they expressed there is eased gradually over our second quarter, which is there first quarter and in that caution is really around the overall financial year they have had before, plus you know what is continue to be a robust regulatory environment, FDA compliance, et cetera.","And we see this caution warm-up gradually over last quarter and we expect it to continue to warm up that, in particular the Pharma sector is firming up, Pharma was really what held us back in Q1 and as I noted in my prepared comments on Pharma turned positive in our second quarter. ","And so we do see some pent-up demand building and really are just continue to press forward and stay very focused on what we do to serve our customers. And we do expect that as we get in the back half the year that that improvement will become more pronounced.","As it relates to the sales force, like I said the expansion and e-territory activity and in some parts of the sales force were less than open positions during the course of Q1. Those were predominantly filled by the end of Q1. And as those positions have on boarded and gained traction in terms of building our territories they are becoming more productive and we expect that to really pay in the second half of the year.","So like I said, before I have the opportunity to be part of a lot of sales force changes over the course of my career and investments and this one in the broad scheme of the world was very modest in terms of the overall scope and I think the team executed well through it and I'm excited about what this team's is going to contribute as we move forward.","Steve Beuchaw","Really appreciate that and then just one quick follow-up. Given some of the commentary in your prepared remarks about maybe somewhat elevated focus on capital deployment to M&A, can you remind us of what your parameters are, what your commitments are, how you think about required returns accretion and then the most appropriate size of the deal that I recall you saying in past years, past quarters that you think about M&A as tactic and not a strategy. Can you just remind us what are you thinking about that. Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, thanks Steve happy to comment on that and the first of all, I would completely reinforce my view on M&A, which is that M&A is a tactic it's not an overall strategy for the company for capital deployment, we will be opportunistic in acquiring everything from intellectual property to technologies to talk in type opportunities - a mid to high strategic bar and high financial bar.","And nothing has really changed in that regard, so in terms of any additional guidance on financial hurdles you know that's probably not needed, because we retain all of the parameters that we have operated with.","That being said, one thing I have had the opportunity to do over the past couple years is to build a corporate development department here at Waters and its lean group, but one that is trying to enhance our focus outside of the Company to make sure that we remain oriented to thinking about growth and innovation from a 360 degree view and I think the team has been very productive.","We have had the opportunity to make a few very high impact minority investments in very promising new technologies that fit right squarely in the center of our strategy and then the full acquisition of the DESI technology from Prosolia where we had a partially exclusive position before, now we really have locked up that technology, which we think is one of the most interesting things going on in mass spec imaging.","I think those are just examples of our the way we are thinking about it and just trying to make sure that as we strive to deliver on our growth and innovation strategy that we are certainly prioritize organic innovation, but also taking advantage of some really interesting technologies that are out in the marketplace.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks a lot Chris.","Christopher O'Connell","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","DanielArias","Good morning, thanks. Chris, can you just help us with the overall mass spec growth number for the quarter and then I guess should we expect some meaningful product news later this year at the high end of the market, I know you don\u2019t like the preempt your announcement, but you kind of came in at something last quarter in terms of new high-res systems. Was that a reference to the GCMS announcement ASMS or you know should we sort of think about some things in the second half of the year that we can look for that would be meaningful when you think about the portfolio going forward.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure Dan. I would rather not break out specific growth numbers other than to reinforce what I said that we had quite a slow start to the year mass spec, things definitely picked up in the second quarter. Now where we wanted to be yet, but moving in the right direction and really excited frankly about what we're doing in terms of R&D investment.","Mass spec is a huge priority for the Company, particularly as it relates a true system orientation around LC aspect as well as what I talked a little bit more about this morning, which is this sort of wide-open field of direct mass spec, I think as we move into the future, there is going to be more interest in some of these direct ionization techniques and there is a lot of kind of whitespace out there for growth.","And we have been assertively investing, we have increased the system orientation of our core mass spec portfolio, which I think is a competitive advantage for Waters and we have also created greater focus around our high resolution mass spec.","In terms of the product it's new and coming. Yes the GC mass spec is interesting and new and current, but clearly there is a lot more beyond that. I have talked in the past about our Bio Taft system, which is working its way through development very, very well and then we have a few what we believe to be groundbreaking technologies in high resolution mass spectrometry that will certainly give more visibility as we role into 2019.","So stay tuned for that, but the bottom line is that we remain very focused on pushing forward technology, pushing forward system orientation and doing things that we can do uniquely well.","Daniel Arias","Okay. And then maybe just on industrial, can you add a clarification there, I believed you said that food and industrial were soft, but that chemicals was strong and I usually lump chemical into industrial. So I guess how are you thinking, how are you parsing things out there and then what is the growth expectation for the year for industrial in the way that you stated in the press release. ","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. So industrial had a lot of puts and takes of course led by TA which gives me the most comfort in the overall tone of the market. Obviously we are benefiting TA from a really strong product and new product launch cadence right now, but we are also benefiting from what we believe are stable end market factors.","Overall in industrial, we did see a sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 and while there were puts and takes like the ones you mentioned there, we do feel that the overall portfolio of industrial on the waterside is normalizing. You know, there were some tough comps for example, in China and India in particular in Q2 of last year was very, very strong industrial. ","There was also dynamic within the environmental business where the EPA had been some pretty big purchasing activity last year where that is not yet recurred in this year and so there is lot of puts and takes. But overall we feel good about the category and expect some of the puts and takes we see in the first part of the year to normalize in the back half of the year, with continued strong TA performance. ","Daniel Arias","Okay. Thanks so much.","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open. ","Jack Meehan","Thanks, good morning guys. Chris, I was hoping you could start just elaborate on the trends you are seeing here in the United States and you know what you know what was weaker versus what was better across the different end markets.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure happy to Jack. On the U.S. as I mentioned before was a bit slower in the first half and a little bit of a mixed bag and I think that really reflect some of the unique customer mix that we have. I mentioned our biomedical research sector has been slow out of the gate, but is very much a lumpy business.","So you know hard to quantify exactly what direction that goes, but Pharma particularly large, large Pharma was a little softer coming out of the chute and certainly offset to a certain degree by biotechnology and generics, but we really remain confident in the overall end market around Pharma and ongoing investments they are making and we're encouraged by quoting activity that we are seeing.","And so the tone of a lot of our customers in the U.S. and particularly in Pharma gives us some confidence in the stability of the market and we think it's a very reasonable expectation for a stronger second half, assuming that we get the typical year end purchasing activity and that this point we have no evidence to suggest that won\u2019t be the case.","So, again another point that I think is important is the strong service and chemistry performance indicates to us some building in terms of some pent-up demand for instruments in terms of our unique customer mix, but overall, you know, like I said, we are expecting a solid second half of the year. ","Jack Meehan","Great. Thanks for all that and then just a follow-up on the government and academic performance, I know this can be lumpy on a quarterly basis. But obviously 2Q look pretty good, where there any revenue that was in or out of the quarter from a timing perspective and just what is the outlook for the rest of the year there, thanks. ","Christopher O'Connell","Yes good point Jack. And yes, it's governmental and academic is a smaller sector of our three and it is lumpy and it was even mixed a little bit within that I mentioned biomedical research was soft, but yet other research applications were strong. Research particular in the part of academics in areas like pharmaceutical discovery, in areas like material sciences, in areas like clinical diagnostics that are more research oriented.","So you know there is there is a good quarter there, you know the patterns in that business tend to be a little more cyclical and so you know we are just trying to focus on the things that are going well and try to make sure they are more enduring.","Jack Meehan","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. Chris I want to follow-up on your comment a minute ago about the U.S. and you mentioned slower than expected budget release from Pharma. Can you maybe just elaborate has some of that subsequently comes through post quarter and I guess what gives you confidence, it\u2019s a budget release issue and not something else.","Christopher O'Connell","Good question. I would just sort of reiterate what I said, Tycho. We watch this very carefully and in many ways it feels like last year where we saw the same pattern, where we had a slower budget release from our largest Pharma customers in the first half year and that firmed up in the second half of the year.","And at this point like I said we don't have any evidence that that's should not headed in that direction again and things that we focus on when understanding the tone of our largest Pharma customers is certainly the service and chemistry and utilization of the technology, which is solid, the quoting activity, which we are encouraged by.","And so the tone that we are hearing, we are obviously very close to these customers gives us like I said a reasonable expectation for you know more solid second half and that's what I can see from where I sit right now. ","Tycho Peterson","Okay and then you guys are obviously putting up good numbers in China and that\u2019s kind of consistent with what we have heard from peers about the demand environment. Can you talk to how you think about the back half for the year, the sustainability, you didn\u2019t proactively make any comments on tariffs, so there is nothing we really need to be worry about that either. ","Christopher O'Connell","From a China standpoint, tariffs is really not a factor right now and that\u2019s obviously an evolving picture, but you know at the end of the day we don't export out of China, we import very little directly to China from the U.S. The vast majority of our business into China comes from our global manufacturing supply chain network and so we don't necessarily foresee a large impact on that part of it.","But just in general, China is performing well, it appears from everything we can see solid and even in our forecast we are not necessarily assume everything goes perfectly right and you know my impression just from spending a lot of time in China and around Asia generally is just, you know, while it's not always the straight line, the long-term outlook is promising and we have a very diverse business in China its actually the most diverse portfolio we have of any major geographical and market.","There is less Pharma weight there, more food and materials weight and there appears to be a really decent amount of balance in the business right now. So our expectations of our China team continue to be high and we are investing to sustain that type of growth in investing to win.","Tycho Peterson","Alright and then just last one, I\u2019m curious about the decision to enter the GC market, obviously you are partnering up with going to OEM, the GC piece of it, but what do you think your advantages in that market or is it just opportunistically pushed into it. ","Christopher O'Connell","You know it\u2019s interesting because the GC-MS market is an important market, where we think there is unmet measurement need if you will unmet technology on the mass spec side and historically and I don't have the full history because I have only been here a few years, but historically we did have quite a bit of presence in that GC-MS field and I think our position faded overtime and the team has been really excited about reasserting that.","Particularly applied workflows, in food and material science, large food labs in China and Europe are demanding this technology and we thought it was a very focused way to play it to really be able to hook on to some of the more broadly accepted core GC technology to provide a superior mass spec interface which we think the market needs.","And so we definitely see an opportunity there. It\u2019s not the - won\u2019t be the largest product offering in our mass spec portfolio for sure, but we think it's a nice notch and frankly it will help us drive our overall portfolio particularly on the food side.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thanks.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Thanks Tycho.","Operator","Thank you our next question will be from Puneet Souda of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Puneet Souda","Hi Chris. Thanks for taking my question. I have two broader questions maybe one of around first let me say around empower, how would you characterize the Empower strength today in the position that it holds in the market versus a year or two back. Is it strong and sticky as it in the accounts and know I\u2019m asking that in context of the U.S. the decline here and somewhat of a Pharma that looks back half loaded, could you may be characterize what the strength you see in Empower is how is it versus before?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes sure I\u2019m happy to talk about Empower, Empower is a really major competitive advantage for the Company, particularly in Pharma in the most rigorous regulatory compliance environments and the one trend that\u2019s unmistakable for sure is the rising regulatory requirements from our customers and the increased priority our customers have on rigorous data management and compliance, and in that environment the Empower position is only strengthened.","Particularly for global companies who are working on the Empower enterprise type network system, and if anything we have seen major customers work to adopt this across their LC platforms and earn, what I call incremental strategic wins, now the reason I say incremental is because we already have a really strong and leading market share we are really in, all of the top 20 or 25 major Pharma accounts in way shape or form and those typically trend towards more enterprise type deployments.","Furthermore, we continue to push the technology down that curve where we started with workstations, we have been very oriented around enterprise solutions and now we are increasingly migrating towards the cloud. So really we are continuing to invest in our next generation chromatography data systems, I personally had a chance to review a lot of that work. I'm excited about taking the strength further and we obviously want to see many more companies besides the enterprise customers continue to behave in that way and we think for that reason there is runway.","Puneet Souda","Okay, thanks for that. And the second one I have is around the recent retirement and management changes, I wanted to get a higher view from you, your vision, your long-term strategy. So we have seen 15 to 30 years tenures of senior leadership at waters, but recently I mean Rohit Khanna, SVP, Applied Technologies, he was there for 30 years, I believe he retired, David Terricciano, who is the Head of Global Operations. I believe he has also taken retirement and Ian King is approaching close to 35 years, he has been excellent at technology and new product introductions.","So my question here is, how are you thinking about the next round of leadership, should we expect them to rise from within the Company as traditionally been the case, or should we expect maybe potentially outside of the LC-MS business, just wanted to get your views there? Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, well thank you for the question. Because certainly investing in our organization in a very broad and deep and diverse management team is the very top priority of mine, I spent an awful lot of my time on this and you mentioned some outstanding people. Our current executive team is a very strong balance between deep, credible, proven industry experience with sprinkling in of some fresh perspectives, which is exactly the way you want the management team to look.","Some of the retirements you mentioned were sort of long planned retirements both on those individuals parts as well as our part. We had robust succession plans for all of them, you mentioned Ian, he is the head of our product development organization and doing a fantastic job and we continue to leverage that expertise.","But one thing that's been a real joy for me coming into the Company is getting to know management at the next level and employees throughout. I have brought in a really a transformational talent review, organizational development process that has substantially increased the rigor and development and investment in our top talent.","I have even personally designed and teach a three day leadership course to our top up-and-coming people and all of our management is involved in that process in furthermore leading in developing teaching others. I couldn't be more excited about the talent pool of waters and you do see the tenure and the depth of expertise at many levels and we are increasingly tapping into that as leadership community.","So I could go on and on other than to say I just want to express confidence in what we are doing and I do expect that as any organization evolves overtime that we have a very strong and increasingly strong bench that were developing from within and then opportunistically supplementing that with the new skill sets and new perspectives from the outside where wanted. So it\u2019s a great equation.","Puneet Souda","Okay. Thanks Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard","Thanks. Good morning. Sherry a couple of housekeeping items for you. First, could you talk through the impact of currency in the second quarter on the gross operating margin lines as well as EPS than when you alluded to free cash flow normalizing by the end of the year. What exactly that means that we return to growth or the referring to more like the cash flow conversion metric.","Sherry Buck","Sure, yes. So your first side of question about the FX dynamics in this quarter, maybe just recapping for the top line, the Euro and the Yen is really what drove kind of the FX of 2% on the top line and we saw that favorability flow through the gross margin, we had probably a slight positive impact on the gross margin.","But the dynamic that happened in the second quarter because of our Euro and pound and particularly that our cost base that we have in the pound that impacted our operating expense. So that kind of flowed through on our operating expenses as a headwind on our operating expense line. So we have guided on the EPS, we thought it would be $0.01 positive and we ended up a little bit more positive than that.","As far as the cash flow normalizing, I would say it would be more of a return to growth and we like to look at our cash flow conversion, at $0.27 for the half, we also probably see that improving by really returning to growth. The second quarter was really a dynamic of timing of our estimated tax payments of the results of the U.S Tax Reform. Our balance sheet and working capital are in good position.","Brandon Couillard","What exactly did the $15 million litigation settlement payment relate to.","Sherry Buck","We have some ongoing litigation and we have disclosed in our queue that that had gotten settled. So we got that settled and paid in the quarter.","Brandon Couillard","Alright, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel","Hi good morning. I just want to start with two follow-ups on some earlier questions and then come back with a buyback question. So on the follow-up first, in the first quarter you noted that India represented a - what you call about a 3% year-over-year headwind to total pharmaceutical growth, which I believe implies that this was about an $8 million to $9 million revenue headwind, with that in mind how much of the Q2 strength you saw in India specific to Pharma, was a function of improvement in demand versus just a recap for revenue you didn't get in Q1? And the second follow-up is recognizing U.S. revenue declined 2% year-over-year, and that this was against down to 2% to 2.5% comparison from last year, do you expect U.S. to grow in the second half given you are going to face tougher comparisons then you did in the first half where you actually you know maybe struggled relative to expectations?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks Doug. I think for the most part I would just say in India, just a follow-up on those questions. The Q2 kind of incremental strength we saw in Pharma was probably some combination of a little bit of pent-up demand plus just a warmed up purchasing tone of the customers as I mentioned.","And Pharma was positive in Q2, is certainly not where we wanted it to be in India or where we expected to be in the back half of the year, and I guess looking at the big picture it doesn't necessarily surprise us that as we sort of anticipated when we were on the call last quarter that it would sort of build over the course of the rest of the year. So that's moving along as we expected it to.","Relative to the U.S. I think it's a fairly simple answer to your question, which is, yes, we do expect the U.S. to grow in the back half of the year, and that is just based on as I mentioned earlier reasonable expectation for typical year end purchasing activity in somewhat of a pattern that we saw last year.","So we are just focused on the basics there and making sure that we understand the tone of our customers that were quoting activity and how we translate that into their deployment of their budgets, which have been conservative in the first part of this year as I mentioned.","Doug Schenkel","Okay, thank you for that. Then on buybacks last quarter you noted your share count guidance for the year assumes $800 million in buybacks you are on pace for 1.1 billion in total buybacks just annualizing what you have done thus far, given the significant authorization last quarter is there any reason you don\u2019t continue to buy back shares at the current pace of around $270 million to $280 million per quarter?","Sherry Buck","Yes Doug. You know so far through the first half your numbers there we have had about 550 million and I would say we could maintain that through the second half and we will evaluate that over the course of the coming months.","Doug Schenkel","Okay thanks Chris, thanks Sherry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Catherine Schulte of Baird. Your line is open.","Catherine Schulte","Hey guys, thanks for the questions. Chris when you look at Water\u2019s branded instrument, what do you think the most important factors will be in order to get that piece of the business back to mid single digit growth and how long do you think that takes?","Christopher O'Connell","Now it\u2019s a fair question and certainly it is a portfolio effect, obviously we need to continue to step forward in our progress we are making in mass spec and continue to leverage the strength of our tandem quad portfolio in that regard. While also competing well on the high-resolution side as we continue to invest for the future and you on the LC side, there are other flows in the LC business.","We have a fantastic portfolio and feel better about our portfolio now probably than anytime over the past few years. Given some of the refresh we have done there. I mentioned the acuity ARC is done well, but now we have acuity ARC bio the acuity plus which brings in a whole new set of capabilities to our core UPLC platforms, you know when and really, if you look at the broader trends in just a standalone LC business the first half as a whole. U.S. LC was more like a mid-single-digit grower with worldwide being in that same range and so.","You know it's really matter of making that the whole portfolio work and leveraging the benefit of some of the newer technology we have and continue to meet the needs of our customers, but we certainly have an expectation as well as set goals to make sure that that overall portfolio of Waters branded instrument performs at the levels we expect.","Catherine Schulte","Great thank you and then Sherry can you just give us a bridge for the EPS guidance change, sounds like $0.7 or $0.8 of what\u2019s favorable FX but any other change assumptions there?","Sherry Buck","You hit that one on that, so our guidance changed we lowered the midpoint of about [7%] (Ph) and its really because of the change in our FX for the second half of the year and really our approach assumptions for the guide can remain unchanged.","Catherine Schulte","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrily Lynch. Your line is now open. ","Derik de Bruin","So first one is the DESI technologies has been around for a while and obviously it\u2019s been partnered with some other companies. I\u2019m just curious as to why you doing that acquisition now and then just in terms of can you give us some metrics in terms of what M&A is going to contribute to your constant currency growth in 2018.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure, just a couple of additional comments on DESI this technology has been around for sure. It's been in semi or co-exclusive type of an arrangement with other partners, and frankly, we see a huge opportunity to personally within Waters develop the technology to make it even more robust usable and widespread for mass spec imaging.","And frankly, we see a significant pull from our customers to one of the key sources of differentiation in some of our high-end systems and I think we were held back probably from doing all we can with the technology in that type of model.","There is obviously a transition period in their relative to other technologies, we want to support our customers as they evolve to the next generation of waters driven to the technology and having full control over the technology was a really critical step in doing that.","I think it's also reflective of our belief in the direct mass spec technology category mass spec imaging as part of that and in the really interesting technology portfolio we have, we just see more and more direct sample mass spec applications coming for all the reasons I mentioned and want to control our destiny even more significantly.","As it relates to M&A metrics and that organic growth there is very little of that in the business and even on the DESI side, it's completely immaterial at this point. So really the growth we are getting this year is truly organically driven.","Derik de Bruin","Great and then just one follow-up. So obviously the dollars has been moving quite a bit and getting stronger and I know previously there is been some issues with your [Indian] (Ph) customers losing purchasing power and obviously things moving around and currently even China. I\u2019m curious have you seen any sort of hesitation when people buy because of their budgets and then also is there any sort of indication that the trade issues that are going on are baleen over into maybe some of the OUS competitors like Shimadzu may be gain a little more business? Thanks.","Christopher O'Connell","Yes, thanks. I don\u2019t know I think that\u2019s a really interesting question Derik, and one we just really don't know, I personally don't see any evidence that trade or tariff or currency, associated currency issues that we all watch very carefully have changed purchasing behavior, certainly in India the dynamics we have seen have been much more related to the specific kind of customer and country issues in India around some of the broader economy reforms.","China we really haven't seen any affect there; obviously there is a lot of unknowns out there relative to trade more broadly. I guess personally, the way I look at that as I just try to understand it and if there are any threats, but very much remains kind of a free trader in terms of my mentality and offer my voice to that where I can and hopefully a lot of the rhetoric that\u2019s going on right now is really a negotiation that ultimately restores and affirms the sort of inexorable globalization of our economies and enables free and fair trade.","So again, no direct evidence that there is issues that get in the way of our normal commercial activities, but we will obviously stay focused on that question. I think in the extra time here, we have one more - time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, thank you. Our final question will be from Patrick Donnelly of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks for sneaking me in that Chris. Just on the sales force realignment I know you mentioned positions were mostly filled by the end of 1Q. Can you just kind of talk through what historically has been the timing, kind of ramp up the productivity there, and have you seen the territories bounce back once positions have been filled over the last three or four months?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. And I appreciate the question and like I said last quarter, we tried to just be extremely transparent about what is going on here, but I would continue to reinforce that this is a very small impact in terms of the overall results, it is a relatively minor set of changes and obviously there is a difference when you hire new people when you are hiring kind of fresh inexperienced reps in the company that have a big upside, but have a longer curve versus competitive and experienced reps and we do have a mix there.","So I don't want to put too fine a point on that other than to say that this is normal course of business and we feel good about the modifications we made overtime and it\u2019s all about investing in our team to win in a changing environment. So I will just leave it at that.","Patrick Donnelly","And then maybe just a quick run on the P&L margins came in a little ahead of our expectations. Could you just talk through any key initiatives driving expansion there, I mean even in a lower growth environment relative to where you guys have been historically driving some nice expansion so I\u2019m just kind of curious what the key levers there are and how you are feeling going forward?","Christopher O'Connell","Just a quick comment and then I will let Sherry comment as well but one of our key parts of our value creation framework is continuous operational improvement and since Sherry has come in we put together a comprehensive program to scale the Company and drive efficiencies in all parts of the P&L, everything from how we design products and manage our cost of goods and non-product costs all the way through G&A and you know selling and marketing type expenses.","And really a lot of that is being done to preserve and enhance her overall commitment to our growth investments in R&D and sales force expansion. So, you know I don\u2019t want to put too much detail on right now. We look forward to sharing more overtime, but we are really developing a comprehensive program in that regard and are excited about what it will do to help us to continue to grow scale invest in the Company.","Sherry Buck","And the only thing I would just add for the quarter, we did see some favorable mix in the quarter that impacted that and a little bit of that FX as well.","Christopher O'Connell","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, Sherry and I think we will turn to the ramp up here and wanted to say thank you all for your great questions as always. In conclusion here at Waters. We remain focused on delivering our growth plans for 2018, headlined by an acceleration in the back half the year within our pharmaceutical market, continued growth in TA and broad based growth in China, we believe that market conditions and our strong competitive position support continuing success.","So on behalf of our entire management team I would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3 2018 call, which we currently anticipate holding on October 23, 2018. Thank you. Have a great day.","Operator","We thank you on your participation in today\u2019s conference. That will conclude the call. You may now disconnect. Thank you."],"22174":["Waters Corp.

Welcome to the Waters Corporation Fourth Quarter Financial Result Year 2015 Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Lynch","Thank you, operator. Well, good morning and welcome to the Waters Corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company for the first quarter and full year 2016.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company did not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update the predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for April 2016.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning.","In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled quarterly reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financials included in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which, at this time, generally adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.","Now, I'd like introduce Waters' Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell. Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It's great to speak with you again. The last three months since my first earnings call as Waters' CEO have flown by. It's been an exciting and enjoyable time for me. This morning, I will share my thoughts and the state of our business heading into 2016 and our priorities for the coming year.","I'd also like to provide commentary on the changes announced yesterday to expand our leadership structure. However, as I indicated on the last earnings call, my first priority is to drive our quarterly and annual business performance. Accordingly, let's start by reviewing the results for our fourth quarter and 2015 overall.","I'm pleased to report that Q4 was another strong quarter for Waters. In the face of a challenging year-over-year comparison and meaningfully fewer selling days versus the prior year's fourth quarter, sales were up 5% as the positive momentum that we saw earlier in the year continued. For the full year, sales were up an impressive 9% with all major segments of the business contributing to this balanced result.","Now, let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters division performance. Revenues for Waters products and services in Q4 increased 4% led by sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceutical segment which were up 6% in the quarter. Full-year 2015 pharmaceutical segment growth was 11%.","Globally, the government and academic segment was down mid-single digits in the quarter against the very strong performance in 2014. For the full year, sales for this segment were about flat. Sales for the food, environmental, and industrial chemical markets grew modestly, up 3% in the quarter with slower growth in Europe offsetting a strong performance in China. For the full year, sales for this segment were up 7% with balanced geographical results.","From a product line standpoint in the quarter, instrument platform sales grew at 3% rate in comparison to a strong prior year's performance. Just as we saw in the third quarter, demand in the fourth quarter was strongest for our bench top LC and LC-MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. For the full year, Waters instrument platform sales were up 10%. ACQUITY and Alliance LC Technology Systems grew at a double-digit rate and the ACQUITY QDa mass detector continue to expand the usage of MS detection in classic LC end markets.","On the high resolution mass spec front, I'm happy to report that we began shipments of our new Vion IMS QTof platform in the fourth quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 4% in the quarter. This rate reflects the effect of fewer selling days in the quarter.","Waters service business growth was generally balanced across all major geographies with contracted service plan revenues driving much of the growth.","On the chemistry consumables front, sales were up 5% and benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. Looking at the full year, Waters' recurring revenue were up an impressive 9%, a rate that's indicative of strong instrument utilization, growth in service agreements, and a continuing trend towards the usage of UPLC methodologies in more routine and regulated testing.","Now, I'd like to cover Waters' division performance from a geographic standpoint. Starting in the U.S., sales were flat in comparison to a strong 12% growth performance in prior year's Q4. Modest growth in U.S. pharmaceutical and industrial sectors was offset by a decline in government spending. Full-year sales in the U.S. were up 10% with balanced growth across all major product lines and customer categories.","Our European sales grew 3% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits, government and academic business declined, and industrial sales were about flat. And just as we saw earlier in the year, stronger growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. Looking at the full year, Waters' European sales were up 7%, and similar to the U.S., sales growth was balanced across our major products lines and end markets. In China, growth was 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year with our mix well balanced between privately and publicly funded customers.","As I saw firsthand during my recent visits to Beijing and Shanghai, we are truly a powerful franchise in China and are well positioned to achieve continued strong sales growth over the long term. Sales in Japan were relatively flat in the fourth quarter and also for the full year.","Looking at the full-year results, sales were strongest for our chemical analysis business where we saw strong growth for food applications throughout the year","In India, we enjoyed a very strong fourth quarter, capping off a truly remarkable full year performance in that geography. In the fourth quarter, India sales grew at a strong double-digit rate, consistent with our 25% growth for the full year. We continue to see strong demand from generic drug companies for LC instruments, services, columns and networked information systems. Impressively, India's growth was against a very strong performance to the prior year's result.","Similar to China, we have a very strong organization and market position in India. In fact, I'm heading to India tonight, and look forward to learning more about how we can sustain strong rates of growth in this strategic market.","Finally, from a business segment standpoint, TA Instruments' performance rebounded lastly from a slower 2014, growing 9% worldwide in 2015.","So to recap last year, 2015 was truly a milestone year for Waters. I must compliment all of our employees worldwide for staying very focused on executing an aggressive business plan while we smoothly transition to a new CEO, and also smartly invested for future growth.","Financially, 2015 was a successful year. Our strong top-line performance was delivered while generating significant operating leverage when measured on a cost and currency basis. Even with the significant currency headwind, we grew our adjusted earnings per share at a high-single-digit rate, while meaningfully increasing our R&D spending and investing in customer support personnel.","As we enter 2016, we are focused on the following: first, we will strive to continue our track record of delivering reliable and consistent performance each quarter, while also investing for future growth. Second, we will develop our organizational capability, investing in our people and building the broader leadership team that will enable Waters' future success.","And third, we will sharpen our long-term strategic plan, which will guide our ongoing resource allocation.","I believe Waters is poised for continued market-leading growth as we focus on our priorities of product innovation, global market development and excellence in the overall customer experience. In particular, I'd like to comment on our innovation story, which I believe is a rich one.","In 2015, we launched significant new instruments including the ACQUITY Arc and the aforementioned Vion IMS QTof. Launched in the second half of 2015, the ACQUITY Arc System is a modern LC system with the versatility and robustness required to bridge the gap between HPLC and UHPLC while continuing to support validated assays.","In the relatively short time this product has been on the market we are already seeing the system's strength. Similarly, the Vion IMS QTof platform is creating good momentum as we are seeing increased interest and adoption of ion mobility mass spectrometry. These groundbreaking technologies augment the continued steady growth of our well-established technology platforms including Alliance, ACQUITY and Xevo Mass Spec.","In consumables, we continue to expand our line of UPLC and specialty columns as well as advanced analytical reagent kits such as the GlycoWorks labeling kit for glycan analysis. We expect our 2015 product introductions to gain momentum in 2016, benefiting Waters sales growth and market share gains.","In addition, our product pipeline is rich with innovative new product launches planned for 2016 that I will speak more about in the coming quarters.","I'd like to close my comments by commenting on the leadership announcement from yesterday. After a nearly 40-year career at Waters, our Waters Division President, Art Caputo has decided to retire at the end of 2016, and he will serve as a Non-Executive Advisor to me throughout the year.","It is impossible to describe the enormity of Art's impact on this company. He has been a truly unique leader in Waters' history who has personally influenced our market-leading performance, our many meaningful innovations and countless customer successes with Waters technology over the years. While I've only had the pleasure to work with Art for a short six months, it's clear to me that his business and organizational legacy has put us in a strong position to move forward. Perhaps Art's greatest contribution has been many leaders and employees he has personally mentored and developed.","Taking advantage of Waters' deep reservoir of talent as detailed in yesterday's press release, I've had the opportunity to promote key leaders from inside the organization to our newly formed executive committee, establishing a forward-leaning operating structure that will ensure leadership continuity. It will enhance our strategic differentiation and further streamline execution. So, on behalf of all Waters employees, I salute Art and thank him for his extraordinary career.","I also want to express my sincere confidence in our newly shaped executive committee in the broader leadership group as we lead Waters into the future.","Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Gene Cassis, Waters' CFO, for a review of our financials and further comments on our future outlook. Gene?","Eugene Cassis","Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning, all. In the fourth quarter, our revenues came in at $587 million, an increase of about 5% for currency translation which reduced sales growth in the quarter by about 5%, resulting in a modest increase in reported sales growth. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter were down 2% to $1.96 in comparison to earnings of $1.99 last year.","On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.83 versus $1.80 last year. For the full year, 2015 sales grew about 9% before currency effects. While currency translation reduced sales growth by about 6.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up about 7% to $5.89 per share versus $5.48 last year. Notably, the impact of foreign exchange reduced full year earnings by about $0.59. Without this negative impact, earnings per share would have grown by about 18%. On a GAAP basis, full-year earnings per share were $5.65 versus $5.07 in 2014. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release that we issued this morning.","Looking at our growth rate in the fourth quarter geographically and before currency translation, U.S. sales were up 4%, Europe was up 3%, Japan was flat, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14% with strong demand in India and China.","On the product front, LC and MS instrument sales increased by 3%, and our recurring revenues grew by 4%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 4%. TA sales were up 16% in the fourth quarter, and 9% for the full year with new technology offerings and acquired product benefiting the quarter and the year. Sales was strongest in the U.S. and Asia where the growth rates were up in the double digits during the quarter.","Now, I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus last year. Gross margins for the quarter came in at 59.4% as compared to 60.1% in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year in 2015, gross margins were 58.7% versus 58.5% last year.","For both the fourth quarter and full year, foreign currency impacted gross margin percent negatively, masking the otherwise positive impacts of product mix and manufacturing cost dynamics.","Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were down slightly as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency exchange on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field head count to ensure customer support.","R&D expenses including those associated with new product development and incremental investments grew about 2% in the quarter before taking into account the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3%. For the full year 2015, our operating tax rate was 13.8%. This includes the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit that was re-established at year's end.","In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million, and our average share count came in at 82.4 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year, a net result of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $2.4 billion, and total debt came in at $1.7 billion, bringing us to a positive net cash position of $731 million. As of fourth quarter share repurchases, we bought 595,000 shares of our common stock for $78 million. This leaves $441 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the fourth quarter of 2015, free cash flow came in at $136 million after funding $24 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $3 million of investment associated with major facility expansion. This brings our full year 2015 free cash flow to $484 million.","Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 71 days this quarter, up three days from the fourth quarter last year and sequentially down five days from the third quarter. In the quarter, inventories declined by $18 million in comparison to the prior quarter.","Looking ahead to 2016, our outlook generally assumes a continued strong foundation in our biopharmaceutical end markets and stable growth in our recurring revenues. Along with growth from TA Instruments, this will combine to help support a mid-single-digit constant currency sales increase in 2016. Currency translation at today's rates is expected to reduce 2016 sales growth by 1% and earnings per share growth by about 2%.","Moving down to P&L, gross margins for the year are expected to be about equal to those in 2015 as volume-related manufacturing efficiency gains will likely be offset by the negative impact to foreign currency. We expect to manage our cost and currency operating expenses to grow at a rate that's less than our constant currency sales growth rate.","Moving below the operating income line, net interest expense is expected to be around $29 million. We currently expect our operating tax rate to be about 14%. We do have plan to \u2013 we do plan to continue our share repurchase program through 2016 at a rate that we expect will result in an average alluded share count of around 80 million shares, 81 million shares.","Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2016 earnings per diluted share are projected to be within the range of $6.10 to $6.35. Looking at the first quarter of 2016, we are estimating that sales will grow at a rate of about 3% to 5%.","At today's rates, currency translation is expected to reduce first quarter sales growth by between 1 and 2 percentage points. Rolling these factors together, we expect first quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.27. Thank you. And Chris?","Christopher O'Connell","Thank you, Gene. And with that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gene Cassis and John Lynch, Art Caputo is also joining us for the question-and-answer period. We are rarely able to get to everyone's question, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. And after the Q&A, I'll add a few closing comments. So, operator, can we please have the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question came from Dan Arias. Dan, your line is now open.","Daniel Arias","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Chris or Gene, maybe if we could just start by touching on biopharma a little bit this quarter, what you saw on a global basis. Maybe next year, just looking at the way in which you're seeing growth across the different regions given the comps that you're working with. And I'm curious this quarter whether you did see any budget clutch dynamic that maybe you had not seen in previous years. Thanks.","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. Hey, Dan. It's Chris. Thanks for the question. I'll pick a first run at it, and Gene can add. But it's been, obviously, a key focus of ours to monitor the underlying market dynamics in biopharma, which were solid throughout the year, as we mentioned in the call in the fourth quarter, with the tough comparison this segment for us grew 6%, and then double digits for the year.","Obviously, we think we're seeing a trend in the market towards a broader and more diversified pharma end market that's not nearly as concentrated in the traditional large pharmaceutical companies as it has been in the past. But we're seeing a lot of activity in the biotech world, in specialty pharma. And, obviously, our generics business, particularly in India, has been a major source of growth.","Yes, the comparisons are tough, but we do anticipate that the market trends that we're seeing in every phase of the pharmaceutical market from discovery and development, all the way through QC and production, are to remain relatively stable. And so, we are going to continue to strive for good growth in this segment.","Eugene Cassis","Good. And just adding on to what Chris said and following on your question about the dynamics of sales within the quarter, I would say that as the large global pharmaceutical customer set is continuing to be a smaller percent of our overall pharmaceutical business, and as that, historically, was the group of customers where you would see this traditional end of quarter flush, it was actually less pronounced this quarter.","One of the factor about the \u2013 given the large installed base in large cap pharma. That's also the customer's segment where we saw the greatest impact from the fewer selling days and the effect of that has in our recurring revenue.","Daniel Arias","Okay. Thanks for that. Appreciate that. And then, maybe just specifically on the biotech set, I mean, how much spending do you actually see that's increasing post the capital raise? I think the consensus here that those two events are correlated. But I'm just curious about the magnitude of that dynamic to the extent that it does exist. Is there something you can help us with there?","Christopher O'Connell","I don't know, Dan. I think it's hard to tease out that particular factor in the biotech sector. What I've noticed, and I've been out into the market quite a bit visiting customers, in terms of the large biotech companies as well as a number of start-up companies is there is a rush of innovation in that industry. And you probably have the statistics better than I do on R&D spending and the ramp in R&D spending in that area.","But the complexity of the molecules that are being worked on in the discovery phase, the development phase continues to grow, and the demand for more characterization is there. And so, we're seeing a nice, steady trend in that area.","We're also seeing our technology being adopted in new and different ways throughout the manufacturing process. For example, I was visiting a major biotech customer recently on the West Coast, and our QDa system was identified by that company as a new entrant in their quality control process to ultimately replace the peptide mapping that occurs at the end of manufacturing for quality control. So, we see a lot of opportunities as the biotech business continues to evolve.","Daniel Arias","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Ross Muken from ISI. Sir, your line is now open.","Ross Muken","I just want to dig in a bit on the biopharma side, maybe more so on emerging market. I know you mentioned, Chris, sort of emerging market generics, particularly India was strong. We're seeing a kind of volatility in the rupee and some of the other currencies. Just help us think through particularly on the instrument side just how we're supposed to think about demand in those verticals and maybe in euro over the balance of the year given some of those dynamics.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Yeah. Let me comment, Ross, specifically on China and India as good sources of growth that I mentioned, although it is a balance, and there's other geographies in the emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia and some of the Eastern European countries that are slower that's more than being offset by China and India in particular.","And when you mentioned the instrument demand, one of the differences in a market like that is we are still being driven by new placements. So, there is the traditional replacement business. There's obviously a strong recurring revenue piece particularly on chemistry consumables, the columns as well as the service piece. But we're still increasing our installed base which is a good trend because that's going to be followed by the recurring revenue streams as well.","As it relates to the rupee and some of the local currencies and those types of markets, I'll have Gene comment a little bit further, but a lot of our billing is actually in dollars in those geographies. And so, we're watching that closely, but as we build those types of markets, we tend to go first in dollars and try to stick to that factor, which will lend stability to our business over time.","So, really, we'll continue to focus heavily on India and China because together those two geographies are 20% of our worldwide revenue growth, and while growth always isn't in a straight line, and sometimes can be lumpy, those markets both appear to be some of our strongest long-term growth opportunities overall.","Eugene Cassis","Yeah. Just building on what Chris said \u2013 this is Gene \u2013 and thinking about the currency impact. As Chris alluded to, we transact a lot of our instrumentation business in U.S. dollars, but some of our recurring revenue streams, our columns business and our service business are contracted in local currency. So, the valuation of the currency in China and India is one of the components that we're dealing with in this currency headwind situation that we have experienced for the last couple of quarters, and that we expect to experience during the first and second quarter of next year.","Ross Muken","Great. And maybe just turning to the pricing side of things. Obviously, you had good new product momentum across the portfolio. Can you just help us understand sort of the trajectory of price capture just given again some of the volatility and maybe some of the more economically sensitive end markets were in the academic side, government side? Just help us think about across the portfolio how that's differing?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah, from what I can see, Ross, the pricing continues to remain in a corridor where we're getting some modest low-single-digit type of annual price increases at the portfolio level. But Gene, do you want to add anything to that?","Eugene Cassis","Yeah. I just say that if you look at the difference in gross margins for the quarter, all of it is attributed to currency. And I would agree with Chris that what we're seeing is price stability or, in some instances, we're seeing a little bit of price increase.","Ross Muken","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink. Sir, your line is now open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. My first question, can you elaborate a bit more on what you saw on the academic and government end markets in the fourth quarter and also what you're planning for in 2016?","Eugene Cassis","I'm sorry. Can you ask that question one more time, please?","Dan Leonard","Sure. In the fourth quarter, it sounded like you were talking that the academic and government end markets were a little weak. I was hoping you could elaborate on that given strong funding backdrop in some circumstances. And then, what's your outlook is for 2016 for those customer classes?","Eugene Cassis","Yes. If we look globally, the government and academic component of our business has been around a mid-teens percent of our business which, in comparison to the overall life science tool space, is a little bit on the light side. And if you dig a little bit more deeply into that, you find that there's a heavy component \u2013 that the heavy component of higher end mass spectrometry within that number. So, in our -from our past experience, we tend to see that business be somewhat lumpy for us. We're encouraged by the increased funding that we see for next year. And if I take a look at the results that we reported in the fourth quarter and maybe some of the slowness there, the majority of that can be accounted for by a very strong performance in the prior year.","Dan Leonard","Got it. Thank you. And then, my follow-up for Chris. Chris, can you characterize your appetite for opportunistic M&A over, call it, the next six months or year as we're heading into a slowdown and opportunities present themselves?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Happy to comment on it, Dan. As I have been very consistent all along, I see M&A as a tactic that could be employed to deliver our business strategy. We will not see M&A generally as an ongoing strategy. We're focused first on the basic strategic questions of where we want to compete and how we want to compete. And if opportunities present ourselves to make a stronger and more effective from either a product line or a channel standpoint and if we apply our rigorous financial discipline to that type of an investment, we will assess that. But there's nothing in the environment now that would accelerate our appetite for M&A per se. We're focused, first and foremost, on organic growth driven by innovation.","Dan Leonard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Jonathan Groberg of UBS. Sir, your line is now open.","Jonathan Groberg","Great. Thanks and congratulations on a solid end of the year. So, I don't know if Chris or Gene or Arthur, if you want to comment, but if you think about the \u2013 your mid-single-digit growth on the top line outlook for 2016, which seems reasonable given a very strong 2015, I think you're guiding only 6% EPS growth or if you exclude currency, 8% EPS growth. If we think kind of the next three to four years, Chris, as you get to know this business, do you see anything about it that should alter what the historic kind of long-term model has been in terms of how much you're going to need to invest in some of these new initiatives that you've talked about? I'm just trying to think how we should think about the long-term EPS growth model that Waters has traditionally have.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. That's a good question, Jon, and one that I look forward to engaging deeper in over time. Let me start with where you began. You're right, mid-single digit is I think a very solid outlook for this year, particularly on the strong base of 9% growth the last year and really that's based on a pretty broad set of drivers. We've talked about solid underlying market conditions whether that's in pharma or some of the geographies that we've mentioned. Certainly, the recurring revenue stream after a strong 2015 good outlook, consistent with historical trends. The new product uptake that we've talked about in terms of products launched last year but even some of the prior years.","And in the mid-year, we're going to see a little bit of TA acceleration as well with their new product platform, internal analysis. And really, as we look at the year, we want to continue to focus on a number of these levers that we can pull, but also have a spending plan that really is designed to drive growth.","And so as we see opportunities to take advantage of revenue growth in the market that we are positioned to take advantage of that. Obviously, the more we grow in the top-line, the more operating leverage we would feel comfortable shooting for and we're going to continue our regular share of buyback program.","So, when you bake all that in, we do expect EPS leverage as you pointed out in the range you pointed out. And as I look at the long-term model, I guess, there's still a lot of work we need to do on strategy to really characterize what we think our top-line growth opportunities are. But we're going to probably stay consistently focused on trying to gain some modest array of operating leverage, while investing for growth but also that financial leverage. At this point, it's \u2013 I have not set a long-term aspiration for earnings per share growth, but we certainly want to be best-in-class and industry-leading in that regard.","Jonathan Groberg","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Chris. And then just a quick follow-up, Gene, on the free cash flow, where are we in terms of the \u2013 on the CapEx that you're calling out, where are we in terms of stopping to exclude some of these incremental investments on the CapEx end?","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. Thank you, Jon. Yeah. Over the last years, we have been engaged in some major facility builds and also some facility improvements. Specifically, you all recall the new mass spectrometry center in Wilmslow, UK. And over the past couple of years, we've embarked on the modernization program for our headquarters in Massachusetts. And I think that we're still in the midst of that Massachusetts upgrade. I think that 2016 will be another year of investment on that front. Obviously, the Wilmslow facility is behind us.","So, as I think about capital expenditures for 2016, I think they're going to be in a similar range to 2015. And I think there's an opportunity to, maybe, see a little bit of easing on that as we move into 2017 and beyond.","Jonathan Groberg","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Christopher O'Connell","Thank you.","Eugene Cassis","Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is now open.","Tim Evans","Thank you. Sorry to beat the biotech horse here a little bit, but I do think it's important given your exposure there. Can you talk about how you think about the funding environment right now? Obviously, it's a little bit more challenging. And, obviously, you've diversified your pharma base a little bit more heavily into CRO and biotech customers. So, in your 2016 outlook, are you expecting or are you factoring in a little bit of conservatism for this more challenging funding environment? Do you think that CROs and biotech customers in particular might be a little bit more hesitant on their capital outlays?","Christopher O'Connell","Tim, yeah, that's a good question and I would say I'm still early in my process of gaining more to feel for how some of those funding patterns work, A, and B, how they affect our business. I would just caution by saying that that particular segment of our business, biotech and CROs, is a smaller portion of our overall driver.","And so, even if there are modest or moderate short-term patterns of the nature you described, it's not necessarily a major driver, and obviously, we're trying to build balance in terms of our business not just tied to new funding cycles and early innovation, but development programs that are occurring throughout the entire life cycle for those companies all the way to including the production environment and the advent of the biosimilars world.","We're looking to gain further insights into exactly that question you asked over the course of the year and we'll update you with what we learn.","Tim Evans","Do you think you might be able to call out say, the exposure to a combination of CROs plus unprofitable biotech? Give us some sort of close approximation of what that is as a percentage of your revenue?","Christopher O'Connell","I don't know. That's the type of question that I am trying to get out in our own strategic planning process and I'd like to go through that first before I put that type of number out to the Street.","Tim Evans","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Derik De Bruin","Hi. Good morning. Hey, so, a couple of quick questions. One, is there's obviously been some M&A in the chemical industry with Dow, DuPont, and could you talk about sort of what you're seeing in that exposure? And just some thoughts in Japan, I know it's been a tough market, and how do you think about the recovery in that market.","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah, Derik. It's a good question. I'd say it's too early on the M&A in the chemical industry. And we haven't really seen an impact in terms of our relatively modest position in that market from an overall mix standpoint. And really, our business in that sector is pretty broadly spread. Trying to get a read on how a large merger like that affects our businesses. It's challenging and a little bit like the effects that we see from the large pharmaceutical mergers together.","The one thing I can say is that a lot of these mergers to me, and I've visited a lot of this companies through my travels, feel like they're driven by strategic reasons to actually increase the amount of innovation that those firms are able to generate while gaining efficiencies in other areas to pay for innovation. And so, we're just keeping our heads down and trying to act no differently, even though those are larger companies, and try to stay away from any defocusing with their \u2013 with what they're going through and just support them in any way we can.","Gene, you want to comment a little bit on Japan?","Eugene Cassis","Oh, sure. We have a long history in Japan, Derik, and we have an excellent operation there that is able to accommodate changes in the local market. If I take a look at 2015, the growth in pharmaceutical in Japan was not stellar compared to other places around the world. However, what we did see is a nice pickup in the food safety business. And I think we have within Japan a lot of resources that can very, very nicely customize our instrumentation to the applications that are important at the time.","So, we see a broad continuation of that going into 2016. There are no warning signs that we have. We're not expecting the Japanese business to contribute positively to that mid-single-digit growth rate, but we are developing a plan that does include growth in Japan.","Derik De Bruin","Great. And if I can squeeze one final one in, just I got one from a client here. So, Chris, I think you came from a more medical device company. You're now running a more cyclical business, and there's concerns about global recession going on. So, you can talk about how your sort of your background is, as you're looking at now a much more cyclical, industrial global business versus what you sort of used to at Medtronic and just sort of talk about what you're sort of doing in terms of looking at the economic implications for the business. Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Sure. Med tech is not uncyclical. I guess, I'd say there are our own cycles in med tech, and certainly, some of the businesses that I was involved in had a large capital component to them and some of the same underlying dynamics. So, I'm actually finding some perhaps more similarities than differences as I get into the life sciences tools area.","But really, the big lessons from med tech, from my standpoint that I'm really trying to apply here are to continue to sharpen our focus on innovation and where maybe in the med tech world, the goal was to drive new therapies to standard of care, the goal here in our measurement business and our analytics business is to drive our technologies to standard of analysis to have very positive beneficial impacts on our customers. So, some of those underlying principles of innovation and market development are really at the forefront of my mind as we strive to continue our track record of being a strong grower.","Derik De Bruin","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Sir, your line is now open.","Bryan Brokmeier","Hi. Good morning. Chris, as you think about your industrial business as a whole, as well as for TA by itself, how would the global recession impact your business even if the U.S. does not enter a recession itself?","Christopher O'Connell","Yes. It's a good question. And, again, the industrial sector is really about a third of our business overall and that includes industrial, chemical, food and environmental. And if you break it down from there, one of the course of that is the food safety and the food security business and that whole area is maybe can be thought about a little bit differently than the, which you might consider to be the core industrial segments.","I'm still trying to get my arms around what the global recession, if you will, means for some of these end markets. Our business in these areas and particularly in TA, you mentioned TA is very, very diversified geographically and very diversified in terms of customers with very few customers that represent a significant portion of the business.","And so, we're just trying to work collaboratively with these customers to make sure that they can continue their investments in our products, in their capital throughout this cycle. There undoubtedly are effects in certain end markets, certain geographies and certain customer segments but at this point in time, we are just trying to manage through that, and we'd certainly highlight any major dislocations or gaps as we see them materialize.","Bryan Brokmeier","And then, Chris, could you also elaborate on how the roles of the new members of the Executive Committee may be changing and how the decision-making process is changing?","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. So, thanks for commenting. And that we put out the press release yesterday on an organization evolution. And really, this was a carefully planned evolution as Art Caputo has contemplated retirement. And it's been a very smooth process. Art is a remarkable person. And really, the team that he's developed, the talent there is truly impressive. And so the opportunity to promote from within.","So, we have a new structure that is going to enable me to be one step more hands-on. It's going to, I believe, accentuate our competitive advantages by organizing around major product groupings in terms of the platforms group and then the applied technologies group which combines our strength in chemistry service and informatics. It gives us the opportunity to have an integrated go-to market organization, sales and marketing under another leader.","And really, what we're going to do is we're going to evolve into a set of operating mechanism that are very crisp and very regular in terms of enabling each of those large functional leaders to translate our strategy to execution, and to do so in a very efficient way.","So, those processes are well under development. We really don't expect to miss a beat. This is a very senior and experienced leadership team in this industry, in this company. And I have a lot of faith in the structure moving forward. I'm excited about it.","Bryan Brokmeier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Sung Ji Nam of Avondale. Your line is now open.","Sung Ji Nam","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Gene or maybe even Art, could you maybe talk about how the ACQUITY Arc is differentiated from the H-Class in terms of potentially target market segment application and things like that given you're talking about bridging HPLC to UPLC?","Eugene Cassis","Yes. Hello, Sung Ji. This is Gene. I'll start and then Art can add in. The ACQUITY Arc System is actually a system that's designed to accommodate methodologies that are in regulated markets that use HPLC separations technology. It's designed to be able to accommodate column lengths that are typically used in these applications but it also affords the user the opportunity to experiment with UPLC columns and see what the differences are in resolution and speed between UPLC and HPLC.","What we found going to market is that there are number of customers that want to exactly replicate methodologies that were created on systems like our Alliance and we've designed the ACQUITY Arc to be able to seamlessly translate a method from a system like the Alliance LC System to the ACQUITY Arc System.","So, that is the primary difference. The H-Class is designed with componentry and with a fluidic path that's more targeted to those people who are going to move methodology from HPLC to UPLC rather than the audience of the Arc that may want to continue for a prolonged period of time to use an HPLC methodology. And Art, is there...","Arthur Caputo","Yeah. I think Gene has done a great job of explaining the capabilities of the Arc. Maybe I could just add an additional flavor. Realizing that our business \u2013 a large portion of our business goes into the regulated environment pharmaceutical industry, biopharmaceutical industry, traditionally and over a long period of time, as we put in our innovation strategies, we get a mind to evolving our positions as opposed to revolutionizing them, so we have continuity.","The ACQUITY platform is over a dozen years old now. And as that strategy was designed, it was designed to evolve. And at each \u2013 every several \u2013 every couple of years, what we did was examine its penetration into the business. And whether it was the original ACQUITY, going to the H class, going to the Arc and the other iterations, what you find is that we maintain a very current innovation position by watching how the market responds, how the competition responds. And the Arc is a very surgical position that we incorporated last year which took advantage of what we thought as the market moving and evolving in the presence of ACQUITY.","So, the Arc has proven to be highly successful and that it wouldn't exist \u2013 that statement probably wouldn't exist if ACQUITY didn't exist. And so \u2013 and I think that the interesting thing is that you will see continued evolutions of this technology because it's a very powerful platform. And it \u2013 and the customer base continues to respond as if it was introduced yesterday. So that's it.","Christopher O'Connell","Good. Well, thanks, Art and Gene. Next question. I think we have time for a few more.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro","Good morning, guys. Thank you. First question for you was on new products. I know, I don't want to try and front run some of the new introductions you may have later this year at the various conferences but I was curious if you could maybe talk at a higher level about what contribution to organic growth you expect from new products this year? I know you mentioned pricing in your other comments but I was kind of looking at the opportunities set this year from the standpoint of internal innovation and new products? Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. And Isaac, as I think about new products and given the pattern of how new products are introduced, I do take a little bit of a longer view than just those introduced this coming year. We will have some new products this year that we are not in a position to announce yet, that we'll just add to our portfolio. But with the way I think about it is the uptake of products that have been, that are early in their cycle and certainly the ones to highlight the build upon our traditional platforms of Alliance and ACQUITY would be the QDa mass detector that we've talked about, that's a couple of years in the market but really on a pretty steep curve, as well as the TQ-S, XevoTQ-S micro, which has really turned into kind of a work force product in mass spec applications particularly in applied markets like food and environmental.","And then the ACQUITY Arc, which Gene and Art just talked quite a bit about and now the latest one is the Vion IMS QTof that's really going to bring new dimensions to defining resolution in the marketplace. And so, I'm looking at those four products, for example plus some other things for later this year and certainly expect those to be incremental growth drivers above what you might model to be an expected market growth rate of our core platforms in Alliance and ACQUITY.","In terms of putting a very specific number on that, I guess, I am still early in my process in terms of understanding what type of statements we want to make and goals we want to set for the contribution of new products. But it's going to be a continuing theme every year. We added several points last year, and I expect that it'll be \u2013 that category of newer products will continue to be accretive to our core growth rate.","Isaac Ro","Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe a question on R&D spend, if I just look at the numbers this quarter, it does look like a modest sequential deceleration, and I know it's relatively small numbers on an absolute basis, but I'm curious if you could talk a little bit about how we should think about the trend in R&D spend as you think about investing in new projects. Are there other projects where you're sort of allocating dollars away to fund new initiatives? I'm just curious kind of about how that all adds up to sort of the total spend.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. No. That's a good question and it's something I'm laser-focused on because innovation is my number one priority in terms of our growth model. And, really, obviously, trying to get my arms around the overall R&D portfolio and the productivity of it and how we allocate resources to the most promising growth initiatives.","But 2015 was a really big year for R&D. We increased R&D spending, M&A has reported basis of 10%, then upwards of mid-teens on a constant currency basis. And that brings our R&D spending up closer almost to the 6% type of level on total revenue. But also, keep in mind, we have a significant service portfolio, which doesn't have the classic R&D spending, if you will. So, really, R&D spending could be thought of as a little bit higher than that.","In the coming year, I expect, we'll increase R&D spending slightly faster than revenue, probably not as faster than revenue as it was in 2015, because we want to make sure that we can be as productive as we possibly can. But it's really, in terms of the evaluation of when and where to accelerate it, it comes down to a portfolio set of decisions. And I look forward to giving you some more detail over the course of the year as I get my arms further around that portfolio allocation and where I see the better opportunities in the portfolio.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thanks a bunch.","Operator","Our next question came from the line of Doug Schenkel or Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good morning, guys. So, I want to take a shot at two topics. The first on the quarter, the second really related to guidance. So, in a quarter where you, guys, had a tough comparing days working against, your recurring revenue was arguably better than what one would have expected. Generally speaking, this was a solid quarter. That said, it does seem like Waters Division and instrument sales were a bit lighter than might have been expected even recognizing the days impact because that typically doesn't impact capital as much, and you did seem to have strong momentum heading into the quarter. So, I just want to make sure that instrument sales at the end of the quarter were as you expected in that bookings heading into 2016, were okay as expected.","Christopher O'Connell","Yeah. Sure, Doug. I think it's a fair question to always wonder about the different components. I would say everything we saw throughout the quarter was within a range of what we expected. And there's always different dynamics at different points in the quarter, but I wouldn't call it anything unusual as it relates to order bookings and what the book looks like coming into this year.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. And my sense it's that while many investors were expecting guidance to come in below where sell-side consensus estimate is at heading into today, I do think it's fair to say that EPS guidance is below even metered expectations. Can you characterize how we should think about the error bars around guidance? Is it fair to say the bias is more to the upside versus risk to the downside?","And you've talked a bit about how much R&D spend is factored into guidance for the year pursuant to things like health science. Should we view this as the beginning of a multiyear period of enhanced investment to drive some of these growth initiatives? Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Hi, Doug. Why don't I just start on that? If I take a look at the spending in the base year, 2015, I think what you saw is us ramp spending across the year, ramp spending up on the SG&A side, more on the S side and on the R&D side. And that's just in response to what we have seen as a very healthy end market. And that includes 2014 as well as 2015.","And so, as we enter 2016, we are going to start the year off comparing against expenses earlier in the year that were not as high as they were at the end of the year. So, from that regard, it's a little bit of tougher base of comparison.","We also know that in our business, the second half of the year is more impactful in terms of sales than the first half of the year. And frankly, it's further away. We look at the mid-single-digit top line growth as something that's very reasonable given the strength that we had in 2015, delivering a high-single \u2013 almost a 10% growth rate for the company.","So, hopefully, we believe that we have a spending plan that will support a stronger top-line growth rate, but at this point, so early in the year, it doesn't make sense to anticipate that demand will create another top-line performance as we had in 2015. So, we're giving guidance with a high degree of confidence that these are numbers that are achievable, even if not everything materializes in a positive direction.","Eugene Cassis","Yeah. And Doug, I'd just add to that, your question on R&D and multi-year investments and so forth. Just to reiterate that our current R&D spending really reflects our core opportunities with only a modest contribution to some of the new markets like health sciences, and it's certainly, I think, premature to infer the this is the beginning of a new phase of investment philosophy. Investment in the business is going to stem from our strategic planning process. At this point, it's steady as she goes in terms of our traditional focus on our core while seeding some new market opportunities. But to the extent there's a shift in terms of how we want to allocate that portfolio in terms of new market opportunities, we'll have that dialogue in a very transparent way.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. That's super helpful Chris and Gene. Thank you.","Eugene Cassis","Thanks, Doug.","Christopher O'Connell","I think we have more time for one more call, John.","Eugene Cassis","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question came from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Elliott","Yeah. Thanks for sneaking me in here. First one, Chris, I guess, can you talk about the strength that TA had to end last year and how that can carry-forward into 2016. And then a clarification for Gene, can you talk about the selling day impact you had in the fourth quarter and what you expect from selling days in the first quarter? Thanks.","Christopher O'Connell","Sure. Jeff, to comment on TA, we did see a nice acceleration at the year, and TA, that's really a broad-based variety of factors. And one element of which is some of the more newly-acquired businesses that we picked up over the course of the year and the prior years as we build capacity. As you know, one of the elements of the TA business model is to do small tuck-in acquisitions that are under-resourced in terms of the previous companies they were in, and it takes us a little bit of time sometimes to build up that capacity, and we saw some of that towards the end of the year.","And really, as we look to 2016, we do see some carry forward there to your point. But also the main event in 2016 for TA is the midyear launched of the new discovery series, thermal analysis family. It's an exciting new product platform that'll really pave the way for the next level of evolution of that product line and solid growth for the next couple of years. So, we're excited about that. Gene, there was one for you.","Eugene Cassis","Oh, yes. You were talking \u2013 Jeff, you had asked about the effect of the days.","Jeff Elliott","Yeah. In both fourth quarter and first quarter.","Eugene Cassis","Yes. In the fourth quarter, the selling day issue affects the recurring revenues in a more understandable than it does the capital sales business. And, in general, the loss of a selling day typically results in about a percentage loss of growing revenue. So, if you have four or less selling days and the recurring revenues make up about half your business, it's easy to quantify a couple of points and associate it with the selling days.","In addition and it's harder to quantify, it does have some impact on the capital expenditures also. But I would say it's 2 plus percentage points of growth is a good way to think about it. And as we think about the first quarter of this year, you might recall we're comparing against a 15% constant currency growth in the first quarter of last year. So, it's a tough base of comparison, but in terms of selling days, there is one less selling day in the first quarter of 2016. So, using that same mathematics that we did to quantify the effect of selling days on the fourth quarter, that would equate to about 50 basis points of headwind associate with selling days, so not so meaningful, but one of the factors why we were a little bit more conservative on the first quarter growth rate than we are on the full year. Does that help?","Jeff Elliott","It does. Thank you.","Eugene Cassis","Thank you.","Christopher O'Connell","Good. Well, we're out of time. We're slightly overtime. So, I just want to conclude the call. Thank you, everybody, for your great questions. I've certainly enjoyed getting to know many of you so far and look forward to a continuing productive dialogue. So, on behalf of our entire management team at Waters, I'd to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters, and we look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q1 2016 call which we currently anticipate holding on April 26, 2016.","Thank you everybody and have a great day.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"21921":["Waters Corp.

All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. John Lynch, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Lynch - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for the fourth quarter and full year 2015.","We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for January 2016.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the company's earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP financials, included again in this morning's press release.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. In addition, unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which at this time generally adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation.","Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce Waters' new Chief Executive Officer, Chris O'Connell, as he participates on his first Waters quarterly earnings call. Chris?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","I am thrilled to be at Waters and look forward to sharing my transition goals and some of my early experiences and observations. But since my first priority is to ensure strong quarterly operating results, I would like to start by reviewing Waters' third quarter performance.","I am pleased to report that Q3 was another strong quarter where our employees around the world executed and delivered positive results. Overall revenues were up 9% in the third quarter, a growth rate that demonstrates the continued strong business momentum we have seen throughout 2015; and through the first nine months of 2015, revenues were up 11%. Our robust growth was led by strong demand for Waters Division core products and services in the broad-based life science sector.","As we have seen in recent quarters, our pharmaceutical growth came from smaller specialty and generic customers as well as from clinical labs. As I will detail in a few minutes, we also benefited from balanced geographical growth with particular strength in the U.S., Europe, India, and China.","Now let's dive deeper by taking a look at the Waters Division performance. Revenues for the Waters Division were up 9%, with sales to our broadly defined global pharmaceuticals segment up 10% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Globally, government and academic business was flat in the quarter against a strong performance in 2014, with strong growth in the U.S. offsetting declines in certain emerging markets. Sales to the food, environmental, and industrial chemical markets also performed well in the quarter, growing at a mid-teens rate.","From a product line standpoint, our (4:45) platform sales grew at a 10% rate in the quarter, including meaningful contributions from both the ACQUITY and Alliance families. Demand was strongest for our benchtop LC and LC-MS instruments used in broad-based life science applications. The strong demand for LC-MS instruments, including our ACQUITY QDa Detector, demonstrates the impact of our goal to expand the adoption of mass spectrometry to the larger liquid chromatography market. Growth for high-resolution mass spectrometry in the quarter was challenged by tough comparisons to prior-year. Looking forward, we are seeing building interest for our new Vion IMS QTof platform, introduced at this year's ASMS Conference.","Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chemistry consumables, grew 8% in the quarter. Waters Service business was generally strong across all major geographies, with contracted service plan revenue driving much of the growth.","On the chemistry front, the column portion of our broader chemistry business benefited from strong pharmaceutical demand in both research and quality control laboratories. The continued growth of Waters ACQUITY installed base is an increasingly meaningful driver of growth for our chemistry product lines as we garner high attachment rates with our UPLC platforms. We will continue to (6:05) offerings to maintain our competitive edge and fuel our growth.","Staying within the Waters Division, I now want to cover performance from a geographic (6:14) in comparison to the (6:19) performance in the prior year. Growth was generally strong across most end markets, with pharmaceutical and academic sales up double digits. Our European sales grew 9% in the quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up in the mid-single digits while government and academic business grew at strong double-digit rates. And just as we saw in the second quarter, strong growth in Western Europe was partially offset by weakness in Eastern Europe.","(6:44 \u2013 6:53) including the government and institutions. Sales (6:59 \u2013 7:04) government and university customers as well as increased demand from chemical end markets.","In India, we saw continued (7:08) double-digit sales growth driven by demand from generic drug companies for LC instruments, services, columns, and networked information systems. Impressively, India growth was against a very strong performance in prior-year result.","Shifting gears, I'd like to make a few comments on our TA Instruments division. Global sales for TA were up 2% in the quarter. Geographically, sales were strongest in the U.S. and China, with declines in Europe and Japan against tough comparisons. Year-to-date sales at TA were up in the mid-single digits.","Now I'd like to comment on what's ahead for our business. In just a moment Gene Cassis will provide financial guidance. However, what's impressive to me is that our recent growth trends have been driven by strong and steady demand for our core products and broad-based solutions, including instrument platforms, services, and chemistries. These trends suggest sustainable growth.","I'm also excited about the impact we're seeing from recently launched new products, such as the Vion IMS QTof system that I mentioned earlier, as well as the ACQUITY Arc System introduced in the third quarter. In addition, I am encouraged by our promising new product pipeline under development.","Looking at TA (8:19) fourth quarter, our business (8:21) pipeline appears to be strengthening, and we expect moderately stronger and more geographically balanced sales growth as we close out the year.","On the capital allocation front, we plan to continue to prioritize focused investments that strengthen and expand our core product offerings and technologies. I expect that our investment in internal R&D programs will yield impactful new products for both Waters and TA Instruments divisions that will enhance our tradition of technological leadership.","Finally on the financials, Waters has a strong balance sheet and we anticipate continued strong free cash flow. As a central component of our capital allocation strategy, we anticipate continuing our well-established share repurchase program.","Before turning it over to Gene for a deeper review on the financials, I would like to share some of my initial perspectives as CEO and a few of my priorities during our transition period. First and foremost, I want to acknowledge and thank my predecessor and our current Chairman, Doug Berthiaume, as well as the entire Waters leadership team. By any measure, Waters is a remarkable success, and Doug and the Waters team are to be commended for creating such a strong and sustainable franchise.","The business is built on a strong foundation of customer focus and technological depth, and the organization represents a very special blend of expertise and passion. I have seen this powerful culture in our meeting rooms as well as in our customers' laboratories. Throughout my first two months, the Waters team has demonstrated exceptional professionalism and enthusiasm for me and our exciting days ahead. From my vantage point, our strong execution in the third quarter is evidence of the team's excellence and gives me confidence for continuing positive results.","As for my transition, I am focused on a well-developed plan that is built around four priorities. My first priority is to lead the team in its efforts to deliver strong 2015 results. This began by leveraging existing mechanisms to deliver Q3 and will continue throughout Q4 so that we can optimize results for 2015 overall.","Second, I have embarked on a rigorous program to engage broadly in the organization. I am meeting with and learning from our senior leaders as well as a wide range of employees. This has included every department in Milford, multiple sites in the U.S., and planned visits for our European operations later this month, as well as Asia in early 2016.","Third, I'm accelerating my learning through a comprehensive briefing program to allow me to more deeply understand our technologies and our markets. An important part of this is to understand our business from the eyes of our customers. I've already been in the field multiple times and will continue to be active and visible with key customers on a monthly basis.","Fourth, I am focused on preparing for 2016. Starting in September has given me the opportunity to actively participate in our planning processes as we set priorities and objectives for what we anticipate will be another productive year.","Now I would like to hand the call over to Gene Cassis, Waters' CFO, for a review of our financials and further comments on our future outlook. Gene?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Chris, and good morning. In the third quarter our revenues came in at $501 million, an increase of 9% before currency translation, which reduced sales growth in the quarter by 7%, resulting in 2% reported sales growth.","Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 3% to $1.42 in comparison to earnings of $1.38 last year. On a year-to-date basis, our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 12% to $3.94 in comparison to earnings of $3.51 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.40 versus $1.34 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in our press release issued this morning.","Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency effects, U.S. sales were up 13%, Europe was up 7%, Japan was up 1%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 14% with strong demand in India and China.","On the product front and within the Waters Division, instrument sales increased by 10%, and our recurring revenues grew by 8%. In all, Waters Division sales were up 9%. For our TA Instruments division, as Chris had mentioned, sales increased by 2%.","Now I'd like to comment on our third quarter's non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins for the quarter were 58.7%, compared with 59% in the prior year's quarter. Year-to-date gross margins are 58.5% versus 57.9% in the prior year's first three quarters.","Moving down the P&L, SG&A expenses were flat as reported. However, factoring in the positive effects of foreign currency on expenses, SG&A grew in the quarter as we funded product introductions and additional field head count to ensure customer support. R&D expenses increased by 13% as reported due to our ongoing spending associated with new product development and incremental investments related to our health science initiative.","On the tax front. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 12.4%. For the full year 2015 we expect our operating tax rate to be around 13.5%, and in this projection we have not assumed a reestablishment of the U.S. R&D tax credit. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6 million and our average share count came in at 82.8 million shares or approximately 1.6 million shares lower than in the third quarter last year, this being a result of our ongoing share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion and debt totaled $1.6 billion, bringing us to a net cash position of $680 million. As for third quarter share repurchases, we bought 665,000 shares of our common stock for $84 million. This leaves $520 million remaining on our authorized share repurchase program. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditure, plus non-cash tax benefits from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items.","In the third quarter of 2015 free cash flow came in at $114 million after funding $25 million of capital. Excluded from this amount is approximately $2 million of an investment associated with a major facility expansion. This brings our year-to-date 2015 free cash flow to $384 million, as compared to $324 million for the first three quarters of 2014. Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 76 days this quarter, an increase of three days from the third quarter of the prior year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $9 million as compared to the end of the second quarter of 2015. This increase reflects a normal seasonal pattern.","As we begin to think about our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2015, and in consideration of a challenging quarterly comparison and fewer selling days, we anticipate constant currency sales growth to come in at around 4% or 5%. Currency translation at today's rates would likely reduce sales growth by about 5%.","Moving down the P&L, we expect gross margin percent for the fourth quarter to sequentially improve from the third quarters and approach 60%. Operating expenses will continue to be carefully controlled, and will grow moderately from those in the prior year's quarter as we continue to fund R&D initiatives. Moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $7 million, and we expect our operating tax rate to come in at around 13.5%.","Rolling all these figures together, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share within a range of $1.89 to $1.99. This is for the fourth quarter. Combining this fourth quarter outlook with the results of the first nine months of 2015, we now anticipate full year 2015 constant currency sales growth of about 8% to 9%, and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.83 to $5.93.","Chris?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Gene. And with that, we are going to open up the phone lines for Q&A.","In addition to Gene Cassis and John Lynch, Art Caputo, Executive Vice President and President of the Waters Division, is also joining us for the question-and-answer period. We're rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. And after Q&A, I will add a few closing comments.","So Ashley, if you could please tee up the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Sir, your line is now open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Can you hear me okay?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Hi, Jon.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Chris. Congratulations on joining Waters and for a solid start to your tenure there. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of an expectation? You highlighted some of the things you're engaged in initially and your four points that you're focused on. When do you think is a reasonable expectation for us to have when you feel like you might fully have your arms around Waters and give an update on your strategic view for the firm?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks, Jon, a lot. I look forward to meeting you and everyone else. As I mentioned, I'm focused on a very rigorous onboarding process and obviously I had the chance to study Waters quite a bit in the time leading up to my starting. And as I mentioned, my first priority is to assure continuing strong operating performance. Obviously, I'm also spending a lot of time understanding the industry and the competition, and really truly what differentiates Waters so that as we build a strategic plan, it will be truly distinctive and something that will enable future sustainable growth.","I anticipate a strategic planning process over the course of the next coming year, and as we engage, I expect that conversation to develop in terms of what we're able to say at what point in time. There are a lot of great possibilities for this company. The opportunities to grow are many. I'm focused on leading the team to help make the best possible choices we can over that time period to assure the best returns for our shareholders.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And this is a quick follow-up. Obviously, the topic de jour is in pharma. You mentioned another solid quarter in your biopharma broadly defined, including spec pharma. Are you seeing any, given some of the dislocations you've seen in some of those markets, are you hearing anything from customers or seeing anything in that end market that would make you a little more cautious as you move into 2016? Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks. In terms of the pharma business \u2013 and again, I'm new and getting to know these customers and hearing from them, and so I'll develop my instincts over time \u2013 but I just start by saying, I'm proud that we have a big core position in pharma. As you know, it's our core business. It's been our innovation driver for many years. Some of the most sophisticated users are in the pharma segment and that leads to solutions in a variety of others.","But one of my early observations, Jon, is that we're also seeing this sector change over time. Of course, the large established pharmaceutical companies have been doing better, have improved pipelines. But we are far less reliant on that category of large established pharmaceutical companies than we were in the past. In fact, a lot of our growth now is coming from, as I mentioned in the comments, a specialty form of biotech generics and CROs. We also have a nice trend, I think in our pharma business of geographic diversity, where we're seeing greater contributions from different parts of the word. Really, underlying all of this are (21:38) a push for new analytical methods, as you know (21:41 \u2013 21:46) opportunity to participate in every phase, from discovery to (21:48 \u2013 21:57) model to continue to pursue as our main focus.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","All right, thanks. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Ma'am, your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, Amanda? Are you there?","Operator","Hello, Ms. Murphy, if you are on mute, please check your mute button and unmute your line.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Apologies for that. Sorry about that. Welcome, Chris. I just had a quick question on the QDa. That adoption has been quite impressive, actually. I'm just curious, number one, how much did that add to revenue and I'm not sure if you can quantify exactly but I think you had talked to a percent or so. Is that still the case? And then I think that's been really sort of an add-on product, so I'm curious if you could give us a sense of how much of your install base has adopted that step platform at this point. Just trying to get a sense of how much run-rate you have there.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks for the question on QDa and pointing out that this particular product, this mass detector that integrates into LC is a really neat product because, like I said in the script, it has mass spec capability to the broader LC base. We think we're pretty early in the process. This product was just launched in the last year, and, as you know, product launches in this business sometimes really take multiple years to find their full effect; and so while QDa clearly did enhance our growth in the quarter, and has over the past few quarters, we're not going to quantify specifically what those numbers are. We think we still have a long way to go on QDa and expect it to be one of our core drivers for next year. Gene, would you like to add anything to that?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","No. I think that covers it very well, Chris.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then on the recurring revenue side, obviously that growth has been quite strong as well and you've had some new products launched there. So in terms of thinking about that longer term, is that still going to be high single-digit growth for some time? I think it even got above that over the past couple of quarters.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","It's a good question. And I tell you, as I've gotten in and studied the business model, I'm very impressed by this recurring revenue stream. And obviously that consists of our service and our chemistry. And I've already been diving deep and looking for ways to create as robust of a recurring revenue stream as we can. One of the things that's driving our growth, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is that with our ACQUITY platform we see much higher attachment rates with our own chemistries than with the overall install base.","And so as ACQUITY continues to gain traction and we have more platforms of ACQUITY on the marketplace, I'd also point to ACQUITY Arc as another big launch for the year that's having a big impact. You know we expect to see steady and predictable contribution from the chemistries business. And obviously, chemistries continues as a category to be a big focus of our innovation as well in what we're trying to do there.","On the service side, you know we obviously continue to prioritize that area. The team has made some great strides in terms of putting even more focus on the services business with enhanced management focus. And also if you look at developing markets or emerging markets like Asia and particularly China and India, our service business tends to be a lot more embryonic. And so another factor underlying our confidence in our service line is the increasing participation of the service business model in some of those geographies.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mr. Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Sir, your line is now open.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Chris, I realize this might be a little bit early, but was curious if you could give us a sense of how you view the capital allocation at Waters and whether you think there's room for a dividend to become a greater priority in the future.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brandon. I think it is too early for a conversation like that. You know, my first priority has been to understand the capital allocation strategy. Obviously, I really like the focus of the company around deploying capital internally against R&D and organic growth opportunities. And that's absolutely our first priority is to do everything we can to develop strategies and enhance our strategies to maximize the impact of our core business and the performance of our core business.","And as you know, one of the other capital allocation strategies has been the well-established share-repurchase program, which is steady as she goes and a continued focus of the company. Obviously as I get into this, questions of capital allocation will be addressed and everything will start with first a question around our strategy and our long-term direction, and then all of the other factors of running our business to follow.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Understood. And a quick one for Gene is in terms of the fourth quarter guidance, can you qualify exactly what you're embedding for a budget flush effect here at the end of the year? And if you could quantify the impact of the fewer days, that would be helpful.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Brandon. You know the \u2013 I'll start with the effect of fewer days. Typically, it's much more meaningful for our recurring revenue business. And what we saw in the first quarter of this year, we had benefited from extra selling days. And we had between a 2% and 3% benefit to our top line during that quarter. And we think that the effect of fewer selling days in the fourth quarter will be comparable, so a couple of percent.","If I think about the potential impact of budget flushes in the fourth quarter, I think we've been conservative on that front. We've been looking more at the momentum of our business coming into the fourth quarter. The whole issue of budget flush has been a bigger focus when you consider our large cap pharmaceutical segment of our business. And as Chris had mentioned earlier in this call, that's becoming a less meaningful percentage of our business. So I think when you consider the guidance for the fourth quarter, I would not bake into that the assumption that we are assuming that we are going to have a meaningful flush.","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","Super. Thank you.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Anything else?","Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC","No. That's good.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mr. Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Sir, your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Good morning, guys. And welcome, Chris. My first question is on, really, operating spend. Earlier in the decade in periods of uncertainty Waters occasionally held back on investment in commercial infrastructure until visibility improved. In the midst of what has been a strong period of revenue growth that goes back through eight of the last nine quarters, I'm just wondering if you've been able to reinvest in your commercial reach, and maybe even opportunistically pull forward investment in areas that would position you better to take advantage of some of the growth opportunities that you see heading into next year. It's clear that R&D investment has been ramping. But it's less clear at the SG&A line, at least on a reported basis, recognizing that there is some pretty pronounced FX impact there. So just wondering how you're feeling about your current commercial infrastructure and how we should think about investment there heading into the end of the year and beyond?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks, Doug, for the question. And I'll give you a couple perspectives and then see if Gene would like to add anything. And you're right; I think you asked the question well. Our first focus is to ensure that we have top line organic growth momentum, and when we're in that period and we have good visibility to continuing momentum we want to make sure we're making the proper investments; and as you point out, we have been increasing our investment in R&D. That's a combination between investing in our core business, our core product lines where we've got a strong pipeline, as I mentioned, but also applying investment to some potentially exciting new growth areas like the health sciences.","From an SG&A standpoint and sales force, I'm still obviously getting my arms around the commercial organization. It's a very efficient, very experienced commercial organization that's impressive in terms of its depth of expertise and the credibility it has with our customers. I've seen that first hand as I've gone out into the field and I come from a strong commercial background myself and, obviously, will be very focused on making sure that our team in the field has everything it needs to succeed in the changing environment.","In the quarter, certainly I would say there was a bit of a catch-up on some of that spending and in growth investments in the commercial organization. Obviously, we try to balance getting modest SG&A leverage over time. In the quarter, SG&A spending grew on a constant-currency basis about the level of revenue. But for the first nine months in total, SG&A grew at a slight discount so (32:05) of the year, but we're also making sure that we catch up on that spending and make sure that our team has everything they need to sustain the top line as we head into the next year. Gene?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Chris. I think that sums up the situation where we are today. I just wanted to add that if you begin to look at our expectations for the full year, I think what you'll find is that the typical SG&A leverage that we generate from this business that is characterized by growing our top line one or two points faster on an organic or constant-currency basis than our SG&A, I think that will materialize as we look at full year 2015.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Doug?","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Yes, thank you. And then maybe if I could just ask one more. The commentary on the pharma end market was really encouraging. Heading into Q4 and next year, the comparisons in this end market clearly get a lot tougher. It's great to hear that it doesn't sound like you're seeing any change in the underlying dynamics of that market. That said, it does seem like your growth is increasingly dependent on smaller specialty and generic labs. These might be more dependent on equity market conditions. And just mathematically the comparisons are pretty tough. Recognizing that it sounds things are \u2013 like things are very good, do you think it's prudent for us to be thinking that there should be some moderation in growth in this end market relative to what we've seen over the last year-and-a-half to two years? Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Doug, just maybe a couple more comments, and without repeating some of the themes earlier, but I think you picked up well on our intent and really the reality of our pharma end market transforming over time to a much broader base in terms of some of those smaller players geographically. And of course you're right. It will be a tougher comparison next year. But we're not letting tougher comparisons get in our way of continuing to plan for success in these markets. And we're going through that planning process now. We obviously have a nice combination of new products in the market. But also, as mentioned earlier, that strong recurring revenue stream is a key stabilizing force and a follow-on to a lot of the products that have been successfully introduced and, of course, to continue to emphasize the new product potential.","Our team is working hard to be very responsive to the changing needs of this marketplace and the broadening of that marketplace, as we mentioned earlier. And you know, what I'm trying to learn is just all the different dimensions of this pharmaceutical and broader life science end markets, consisting of large players, the smaller specialty biotech and generics companies, as well as the lab opportunities. So it's a good question. I look forward to a continuing dialogue on this with you.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. All very helpful.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matt Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my questions. And welcome, Chris.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I guess my question about sustainability of demand was just asked. I'll ask in a different way maybe. Heading into 2016 is there a new product pipeline that's maybe a little bit more robust than it was this year that could help you keep more consistent growth going into next year?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Matt. Appreciate the question. And we've touched on a couple elements of this, so maybe I'll try to wrap it into a more complete answer on the product side. Like I mentioned, we're getting nice performance out of our core base. I think one of the neat things from my perspective is it's not just one product here, one product there. If you look at our core chromatography business, we're really getting a nice portfolio effect right now of ACQUITY, Alliance and then some of the new products. The QDa was mentioned, the ACQUITY Arc, which is kind of a mid-range system. We're getting nice performance out of our super critical fluid separations and extraction business, and a number of these, including some of the newer launches like Arc and QDa and then Vion, when it really hits the marketplace, will be product launches that will have a bigger impact than just in one quarter or one year.","And without getting too specific, the team is very focused and I am really trying to reinforce the continuation of the steady drumbeat of new technologies and separations in mass spectrometry, in chemistries that continue to enhance the performance of the systems but also to enable the development of new work flows and applications for more specific needs in the marketplace. So that's probably how I'd sum up the product strategy at this point after two months. And look forward to learning more and continuing to demonstrate the great innovation machine that I think we have here.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one last quick one for me; if renewed, what would the R&D tax credit add to EPS?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe, Gene, why don't you answer that one?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Oh sure. I think that the R&D tax credit has the potential to benefit EPS by $0.02 or $0.03.","Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Gene.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Derik Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is now open.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. And welcome, Chris. A couple of questions; so what was the impact of FX on the gross margin and to EPS?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Gene, why don't you get the details on the gross margin there?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thank you, Derik. When you look at the effects of foreign currency translation, historically we've focused on the euro, the yen, and sometimes the British pound as the major currencies that influence our business. I think one of the things that was surprising in the quarter that we're reporting on now is that we had some pretty significant moves of currencies that are secondary currencies for the company, including the real of Brazil, and the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar all moved against us.","And we had a much more meaningful impact reflected in the gross margin line because we really have no cost of goods sold and we have very efficient distribution operations in those countries. So we had approximately 190 basis points of FX headwind. Now, fortunately, that was offset by gross margin tailwinds associated with higher shipment volumes and favorable product mix. So it was actually pretty meaningful. It's interesting that gross margins did not come out too far from where we anticipated, but the way we arrived there was a combination of much more significant FX headwinds offset largely by favorabilities on mix and volume.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's very helpful, Gene. And just one final question; could you give a little bit more color about China growth, net market and booking? Thanks.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Derik, maybe let me just make a quick comment on China and then see if Gene wants to add anything else. But I'm very interested in the China business. I'm very impressed, to be honest, with the size of the China business and the length of time that Waters has been present in China, the credibility that we have there, and the foundation, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, on both private and government business. And as you may know from my background, I've got a lot of experience operating in China.","I tend to take a long-term view of China. I'm pleased that in the quarter we had strong growth, double-digit growth, and the one thing we all know about China is not everything is on a straight line. But for us to become the preeminent global company in this space we will prioritize a leading position in China. Underlying demand approximated the sales growth and we continue to see relatively stable demand out of China. I'm going to be in China in early 2016 and look forward to diving a little deeper and understanding this market even better. But I am encouraged by the franchise we have in China and, for that matter, in some of our other big emerging markets like India. Gene?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","I think that summarizes it very well, Chris.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink. Your line is now open.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you. I was hoping perhaps you could elaborate on trends in Japan by end market, and also remind us of what your business mix looks like in Japan by end market?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dan. Japan, let me make a quick comment on Japan. And again I have not had the opportunity yet to visit Japan, but I will early in 2016. Japan represents about 8% of Waters' sales overall. It's more of a modest growth business, moderate kind of mid-single-digit type of business, a very well-established, loyal customer base. Very profitable businesses, as many Japanese businesses are in the instruments and device world, and as mentioned before, we had good business in the government and academic markets there in the quarter. So I think it's a very stable situation and a position of strength. But Gene, do you want to add anything more on Japan?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Chris, I think that summarizes it well, but I would just say that in the second quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, in the third quarter, we had a tough base of comparison in the pharmaceutical segment of our Japanese market in that in the prior-year we had some very successful large orders for informatics systems that did not, obviously, repeat in the third quarter. So I think that the underlying demand in Japan is actually healthier than the 2% constant-currency growth rate suggests, and we're very encouraged by the strength of government and academic spending as well as our industrial and applied market spending in Japan, and that is encouraging for the fourth quarter.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","And then for my follow-up, and maybe this question is six months too early, but Chris, can you talk about how much you might be willing to dilute the margin structure of Waters with either organic or inorganic investments?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think that type of question is certainly premature in my process to understand our overall P&L and our investment strategy for the future. Again, I'm trying to focus on the fundamentals of understanding what makes this business go, and make sure I'm doing everything I can to ensure continued strong performance. You know, a strategic look at the business will increasingly become a focus. Our goal is to develop a very sustainable, robust business that's delivering for the long term. I know that's not saying too much but I look forward to engaging in all those topics in the future.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning and thank you, guys. Chris, just want to start with a question about your prepared comments on the end markets. I thought you said that EU academic was up double digits. Is that right? And if so, could you just put come color on that? It's obviously well above trend.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Yeah. We did say that. The European \u2013 on a constant currency basis, the European business was up 9% with strength in that particular area. And obviously, we're seeing a lot of demand for many of our research products in that area. And maybe Gene can say a little bit more about what's happening in that sector in more depth.","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I would say, Isaac, that the business that we have in academia is weighted towards our higher-end mass spectrometry product offerings, and it tends to be a little bit more lumpy. So one of the things about the third quarter performance is that we were comparing against a favorable base of comparison in the prior year, and that's somewhat the nature of our performance in that sector.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a bigger-picture question for Chris. Obviously Waters has a great track record as a company for being pretty efficient, everything from margins to cash flow into the great tax rate. So if you bring a different set of experiences from Medtronic. I'm curious if, in your short time so far, if you can point to any areas where you think that the operations of the company could be more efficient just based on your prior experience at a bigger company?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. That's a great question and one that we'll increasingly answer over time. But you're right. One of the great strengths of Waters is the very strong financial discipline. I think what you'll find is that I'll continue that tradition. That's one of the commonalities that Doug and I share and the management team and I share, and I think in many ways the company has done a really good job weathering FX and other issues plus investment needs to deliver sustainable growth and strong margin performance. And obviously, I want to continue that.","With that, I will always be looking for new opportunities to free up investment for revenue growth drivers, particularly R&D as well as sales force. Those will be two of the bigger priorities. And I do see little pockets of opportunity over time. It's probably premature for me to comment on exactly what those are, but there are definitely some efficiencies that we can drive in all parts of the P&L as we grow and scale this business.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mr. Tycho Peterson with JPMC. your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Chris, maybe just following up on the comment on your prior experience with Medtronic, obviously, there you ran businesses that faced more end-market challenges and secular headwinds. Clearly that's not the case with Waters, where end-market dynamics have been strong. So can you maybe talk a little bit about what in your operational background you can bring to the growth story at Waters, and then, along those lines, we haven't heard a lot about the Health Science Initiative, but clearly there are investments in the distribution channels and manufacturing we need to think about. Can you maybe talk a little bit about maybe milestones we can track, and should we assume at some point this gets broken out as a separate P&L line item?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks for the question, Tycho. I appreciate it. I think your characterization was reasonably accurate in terms of the differences in the end markets within medical devices versus this space, and obviously I'm continuing to try to understand what those are. And you're right; we are blessed at Waters with great end markets and strong positions that are in general more stable and more recurring than some of the markets I've participated in. Although, certainly I had some businesses before that had mixes of capital and service and consumables as well.","I think, overall, what you'll see from me in terms of reflecting from my background as I come into Waters is a very strong focus on innovation. I grew up in a company that was all about some of the same principles in terms of being extremely responsive to unmet needs in the marketplace for innovation, where innovation can make a difference in terms of improving our customer's performance. And so I'm very interested in innovation and how to bring some of those lessons forward into this space.","The priority for that, as I mentioned before, is in our core business to ensure we're doing everything possible to drive the core business but there are some very intriguing opportunities down the road. You mentioned health sciences. Obviously I have a personal understanding of more regulated markets, and I'm certainly not afraid of these markets; in fact, I'm quite excited about them. But we're going to approach some of these market opportunities in a very measured, very thorough manner. We've got a lot of work to do to characterize these opportunities, to build plans. And as we do that, we will look for opportunities that enhance and grow our top line and our margin structure over time.","So this whole area of health sciences is very interesting, and as you know we're already serving some of these segments in terms of neonatal screening, (50:09) drug monitoring. And so the question over time from a strategy standpoint is just one of degree and emphasis, and we'll have an opportunity to talk more about it. At this point any thoughts on breaking out these revenues or establishing new structures around that is premature.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, I think you noted an uptick in industrial. Clearly the data points from the true industrial companies have been pretty poor this earnings season. Can you maybe just talk about where you're seeing the strength? Was that really just on the applied side? And your visibility into that channel.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Maybe I'll make a couple of broad comments there and Gene can comment further. But the industrial markets or the applied markets of food and environmental and the chemical industries is a really intriguing set of markets. From my standpoint, it's impressive how Waters has taken some of the core technology originally developed for primary use in the pharmaceutical sector and created new applications to serve those markets.","And there are some interesting long-term trends, particularly in food security, food safety, food authenticity, and a good stable business in the chemical industries sector as well with a wide range of applications that we're in today and we can develop for tomorrow in a very efficient way. So we've been able to serve these markets, in my early view, in a very efficient manner both from a R&D investment but also from utilizing our well established sales force to call into these areas. So I think we're getting some pretty good performance out of them right now. Gene?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The only thing that I would add after that good summary, Chris, is that if we look at that segment of our business, one of the components there is food analysis. And what we have seen in the quarter that we just \u2013 that we're reporting on here is that we had a particularly strong performance for food safety testing. And I'm not sure it is that we're yet seeing the full impact as the U.S. begins to move more deliberately down the pathway of mandating more testing, but it's certainly encouraging at this time.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good morning. So I just want to touch back on sort of the emerging markets. Can you just give us a sense versus prior periods how you would kind of characterize the current environment? And what would you need to see on the currency side, for instance in places like India, to get more concerned with what that could do to the demand trajectory? I mean it's obviously been a broader market issue, and obviously your business has proven to be a bit more resilient, so just sort of some context from the historical basis on that, maybe, Gene. And then on the \u2013 actually start with that and then I'll ask my follow-up.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just a quick start to that, Ross; this is Chris. The emerging markets are a big focus for the company. Obviously, we're getting quite a bit of business out of there, and to your point exactly, the underlying demand in China and India and the emerging markets, with some exceptions. I mean we haven't mentioned Brazil specifically, which was a challenge in the quarter, so there are some emerging markets that are not operating as robustly right now.","But certainly India and China are examples where the currency situation has not yet manifested itself in a fundamental change in demand, and so we're monitoring that closely but also doing the things to be successful on a fundamental basis for the long term. Obviously, other emerging markets like Brazil have been a little bit more disruptive and we're watching those closely and looking for ways to improve, but Gene, do you want to comment on that?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. The only thing that I would add, Chris, is that in some of the larger emerging markets we do transact our instrumentation business in U.S. dollars. So it somewhat limits our exposure to some of these dramatic shifts. But in terms of spare parts and some of our services, those are denominated in local currencies, so that has been a component of the FX headwind that we encountered this quarter.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe can you just remind us of the emerging market comp in sort of the key, maybe the key ones in China, India as we enter 4Q and then give us a bit of a sense of how the jump-off into 2016 compares to what we had in terms of the jump-off from 2014?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","In terms of emerging market basis of comparison as we look at the fourth quarter, I'm very impressed with our performance in India in the third quarter because we grew double digits off of a double-digit quarter in the prior year.","If I begin to look at the dynamics in China, we had a very successful third quarter result, but we are facing a more challenging base of comparison in the fourth quarter. I remember last year we began to see the business ramp in the third quarter, but our sales growth really came in at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter. So our assumptions embedded in our guidance is to see a little bit of slowing in our China growth associated with a more difficult base of comparison, but we are very encouraged by the trajectories that we have in India and think that that has some sustainability going into the fourth quarter.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good. I think we have time for a few more questions. So why don't we get the next one?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I have two for you. Chris or Gene maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question. Just in thinking about the revenue growth in your service business, it's been pretty strong this year along with strong growth in instruments. But the growth in services has been strong for a number of years now, and so I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on if there's any relation between the growth in service versus your growth in instruments or any other color on what's driving the strong service growth over the last number of years? And then the second follow-up is just, Gene, within your guidance for this year, what are you now assuming in terms of the EPS impact from FX in your overall guidance? Thanks so much.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. And maybe just a quick note on service there, Steve, and Gene can comment as well. But you're right to focus in on the sustainability of the performance in service. And it's a pretty fundamental mix between both the contracted service business, which we continue to strive for higher attachment rates and good customer value and pricing that comes along with that, but also a fairly robust parts business and the continued maintenance. As you know, our equipment is heavily used and is used for a long time, and the opportunity to help our customers maximize the return on those investments has also resulted in a great service business. It'll continue to be a big priority for me moving forward.","So, Gene, do you want to put a finer point on that?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Well, just on the service side, in the last quarter we did see a very nice service growth in some of our larger Asian markets, and as the installed base continues to ramp up nicely in those countries, and as there is a higher degree of focus on making sure that these instruments are properly validated, especially for pharmaceutical applications, I think that that provides us with a base of stability for our service business going forward.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","And the question on the guidance?","Eugene Gene Cassis - Chief Financial Officer","Oh. On the guidance. Yes. Thank you. Looking at the effects of foreign exchange on our business, if I look at where we are year-to-date, foreign exchange has been pretty meaningful on the EPS line; we think it represents about $0.41 of EPS headwind associated with foreign currency exchange. The last quarter was a little bit more dramatic than we had originally anticipated. So for the full year and looking at the fourth quarter we think that the effects of foreign currency are going to be not quite as dramatic as they were in the third quarter because we began to see currencies move in a positive direction last year. We think for the full year the effect of foreign currency exchange is going to be similar in the range of $0.50 to $0.55 of headwind for the corporation.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Good afternoon \u2013 or good morning, and welcome, Chris. Following up on the question previously on the service business, you said that it was strong. Could you describe a bit of the impact that your business is having from some of the lab-wide service offerings of your competitors?","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","(59:50 \u2013 59:59)","Arthur G. Caputo - President-Water Division & Executive VP","Yeah. Bryan, one of the things about our services (1:00:04) business is that this is an area where we have continually invested heavily to make sure that we are providing the top service levels that our customers can (1:00:20) to sell an instrument. Invariably, they will cue in on service as being a primary driver as their reason for investing.","The second aspect \u2013 and we find ourselves much more insulated from the third-party effect because of our basic strategy. It's heavily innovative based. Things like ACQUITY or LC-MS solutions, these offerings that consist of instrumentations, chemistry, support services insulate us from the traditional attacks that third-parties usually go after. And they're usually going after more commoditized offerings, where, quite frankly, our primary emphasis for growth is in the areas of innovation and performance. And the more commoditized offerings, while we sell there, is not what our customers recognize us for; so when third-party goes into the account, they don't associate us with as highly being susceptible to third-party as many of the other vendors in the industry.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","Good. Thanks, Art. Appreciate that. And I think as you can see, Bryan, the service business is a really interesting part of Waters and a big area of investment and something that we're all working closely on to make sure we continue to get the performance out of it for the future that we've gotten out in the past as well.","Christopher James O'Connell - President & Chief Executive Officer","I think we're a little bit over time. And so maybe I'll bring the Q&A session to a close. But thanks for your great questions. I really enjoyed our first call here together today, especially the substantive dialogue we just had in the Q&A. I do look forward to getting to know all of you well. And as that goes, I am committed to interacting in a manner that keeps our communication open, honest and insightful. At this point, Gene and John and I are mapping out opportunities for me to meet with a number of you later in the fall, as well as to engage with the investment community more broadly throughout 2016.","So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters.

This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today\u2019s call is Gene Cassis, the Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and John Lynch, the Vice President of Investor Relations. As is our normal practice, I\u2019ll start with an overview of the quarter\u2019s business, and Gene will follow with details of our financial results and then update you with our outlook for the third quarter and for the full year. And before we get going, I\u2019d like Gene to cover the cautionary language.","Gene Cassis","Thank you, Doug. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company, this time for quarter three and full year 2014. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events and results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, please see our 10-K annual report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2014.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly compatible GAAP measures is attached in the company\u2019s earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Quarterly Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning\u2019s press release. Doug?","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you, Gene. Well, our second quarter\u2019s results were largely in line with our expectations. Improved demand from our global pharmaceutical customers and strong overall sales growth in the United States contributed nicely to our topline. In comparison to the first quarter, higher sales volume, more favorable currency translation, and continued cost controls resulted in improved operational leverage and double-digit growth in our adjusted earnings per share.","Looking at the second quarter, our constant currency sales were up 6% and our adjusted earnings per share grew at 13%. For the Waters Division, organic sales growth was 6% and benefited from stronger shipment volume to pharmaceutical end markets. Budgetary delays that we had cited in our April call resulted in a shift of business into the second quarter, most significantly in the U.S.","Overall sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical segment were up 8% in the quarter and up 5% through the first half of 2014. Global government and academic business declined moderately in the quarter with growth in the U.S. offset by continued weakness in China and a quarterly decline in Europe.","This European decline was primarily due to very strong growth in the prior year\u2019s results. We anticipate government-funded instrument sales in the U.S. to continue to increase during the second half of this year and are also seeing signs that governmental spending in China is beginning to improve. Our combined industrial chemical and chemical analysis businesses grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter and benefited from a nice pickup in most developing markets.","Geographically, we saw varying levels of strength across our key regions. Coming into the quarter, we were very focused on monitoring business conditions in China. As you may recall, a drop in order volume had an adverse effect on our first quarter results, and that we had attributed this lower business flow to delays in placing orders at governmentally-funded institutions. Through most of the second quarter, we continued to see a similar dynamic, and consequently finished the quarter with a double-digit decline in China\u2019s sales. However, during the closing weeks of the quarter, we began to see improving governmental orders, and by the close of the quarter and in contrast of the first quarter, we finished with a moderate increase in orders and a nice sequential pickup in orders in comparison to the first quarter results.","Needless to say, we are continuing to watch for signs of improving momentum in China, and at this time, we feel encouraged by the second quarter\u2019s ordering trends that suggest a return to growth in orders and sales during the second half of 2014.","Sales growth in the U.S. was encouraging in the second quarter. For the Waters Division, sales were up 9% with particular strength in governmentally-funded accounts and with the solid performance in our pharmaceutical business. Elsewhere in the Americas, business trends were very positive and recovered nicely from a slow first-quarter start. Waters Division constant currency sales in Japan moderately increased in the quarter and were up around 8% through the first half of 2014.","In the quarter, meaningful improvements in pharmaceutical and industrial chemical accounts were tempered by declines in public sector spending. Our business in Asia outside of China and Japan was robust in the second quarter. India, in particular, saw a healthy and long-awaited return to double-digit sales growth as generic drug firms resumed adding new instruments and replacing old ones. In addition, the stability of the rupee and a general sense of optimism following the recent election cycle seemed to be contributing to more favorable business conditions.","Our European Waters Division business at constant currency grew modestly in the second quarter. Pharmaceutical sales were up mid-single digits, while our government and academic business declined in comparison to a double-digit increase in the 2013 quarter.","Looking at our TA Instruments division, sales were up 9% in the quarter. Within the quarter, we began to see sales from recently acquired businesses contributing to the division\u2019s topline performance. In general, sales growth for TA was strongest in developed markets, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Underlying demand for TA\u2019s products and services appears to be strengthening as we move into the second half of 2014, and we are looking to achieve mid to high single-digit topline growth in the second half of the year.","Now, I would like to turn to some product line dynamics that we saw in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew 7% in the second quarter. Waters\u2019 service business was generally strong across all major regions as the trend toward higher penetration for service maintenance contracts was apparent in the quarter\u2019s results.","On the chemistry front, our new line of LC columns called CORTECS was recognized as a significant scientific achievement by R&D Magazine with the prestigious R&D 100 Award. This new CORTECS packing product line is complementary to our broad line of UPLC chemistry offerings, and will further expand the application reach of UPLC technology, especially for UPLC MS applications.","Waters Division instrument system sales grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. Demand improved most significantly in the U.S. where our more advanced instrument systems benefited from higher funding for governmentally-supported labs and improved spending by pharmaceutical customers. Overall, sales for research-focused UPLC MS systems in the U.S. were up double digits. Outside of the Americas, sales in Europe for research UPLC MS systems declined against the strong base in 2013. In Asia, shipment volumes declined as orders in China were booked too late in the quarter to complete shipments and recognize revenue.","Demand for our tandem quadrupole systems improved in the second quarter in comparison to our first quarter\u2019s results. The improvements that we saw were most apparent in the U.S. with stronger pharmaceutical demand and an increase in clinical diagnostic business drove our growth. At this year\u2019s ASMS conference in June, Waters showcased a range of new systems offerings. Most significantly, we introduced two new Xevo benchtop mass spectrometers, the Xevo G2-XS QTof and the Xevo TQ-S micro. Each of these new offerings provides researchers with a differentiated level of performance and value in a compact benchtop design. Initial customer feedback has been very positive, and we are anticipating meaningful shipment volumes of these new systems in the second half of 2014. Earlier in the year at the Pittsburgh conference, we introduced ionKey technology for our Xevo TQ-S tandem quadrupole system. This advanced Ion Source couples the demonstrated advantages of our StepWave technology with an integrated tile-based ACQUITY column separation to deliver improved sensitivity for challenging applications.","In the second quarter, adoption of this technology had a positive effect on our high performance Xevo TQ-S orders and sales. Based on the demonstrated advantages of this new technology source, we announced at ASMS that ionKey will be available as an option for a wider range of our tandem quadrupole and top platforms.","On a chromatography front, ACQUITY instrument system sales benefited from another strong quarter for our ACQUITY QDA mass detector. The primary application area for this new detection technology continued to be in the area of small molecule drug research, and in the second quarter, we saw drug research customers purchase the QDA as a detection module for existing UPLC or HPLC systems as well as within new system orders. The sales volume associated with the QDA through the first half of 2014 is consistent with an opportunity to generate meaningful and largely incremental sales from this new mass detector.","Now, I would like to turn to our outlook for the second half of 2014. Broadly speaking, we are anticipating sales growth in the third and fourth quarter of 2014 that will result in full-year constant currency mid-single-digit growth for the corporation. For the Waters division, this growth anticipates pharmaceutical demand that is consistent with the first half\u2019s results, continued growth in governmental and academic spending in the U.S., and a return to positive growth in our China business. The division\u2019s recurring revenues are envisioned as continuing to grow at a solid mid-single-digit range. If you look at TA instruments, we anticipate seeing more sales associated with the recently acquired product lines and a high-single-digit topline full-year growth rate.","On the M&A front and for the Waters division, we see opportunities to benefit our long-term initiatives in applications such as food safety testing, microbiology, and clinical diagnostics by licensing and acquiring innovative technologies. In fact, later today we plan to issue a press release that will describe a technology investment that is directed towards future growth in these areas. For our TA division, we will likely continue a consistent and focused business acquisition plan. However, given our primary focus on driving organic growth, we plan to continue to deploy the lion\u2019s share of our strong cash generation on our share repurchase program.","And finally on leadership transition front, we continue to progress in the search for my successor. During the second quarter, we have continued to identify well qualified executives whose candidacies are now being further developed. Though we are optimistic about completing a transition within the timeframe we have already discussed, our primary focus will be to ensure a smooth succession that will result in the retention of the core tenants of our focused and proven business strategy. I will look forward to sharing with you more information on developments in this area in the upcoming quarters.","In the meantime, we will direct our operational efforts towards building on the positive business momentum that drove our second quarter\u2019s performance and leverage the advantages of our recent new product launches.","Now, I would like to turn to Gene for a review of our financials and an update on our outlook.","Gene Cassis","Thank you, Doug, and again good morning.","In the second quarter, our sales came in at $482 million, an increase of 7% over last year with currency translation adding about 1 percentage point to sales. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 13% to $1.22. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share were $1.13 versus $1.03 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release that was issued this morning.","Looking at our growth geographically and before foreign currency effects, U.S. sales were up 11%, Europe was up 2%, Japan up 4%, and sales in Asia outside of Japan were also up 4%. Strong sales growth in India helped offset a decline in China. Rest of world sales notably including Latin America were up 10%.","On the products front, and again in constant currency and within the Waters division, instrument sales increased by 5% and our recurring revenues grew by 7%. In all, the Waters division sales were up 6%. For our TA instruments division, constant currency sales including instruments and services increased by 9%.","Now, I would like to comment on our second quarter\u2019s non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margins came in at 58.1% versus 58.3% in the second quarter last year. SG&A expenses were up about 3% before foreign currency effects, which added another 2 percentage points. R&D expenses increased 6% before foreign currency translation, and notably the British pound contributed to add another 3 points to the reported growth number.","On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for the quarter came in at about a point lower than expected and at 14%. This favorability was primarily due to production mix dynamics. For the full year 2014, we now expect our operating tax rate to be between 14% and 15%. In the quarter, net interest expense was at $6 million and share account came in at 85.2 million shares or approximately 1.4 million shares lower than in the second quarter last year, a net result of our share repurchase program.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $1.9 billion, and debt totaled $1.4 billion bringing us to a net cash position of $524 million. As for second quarter share repurchases, we bought 908,000 shares of our common stock for $93 million. In May 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a new three-year share repurchase program for $750 million while extending the duration of a previously authorized program. So, in all, we have more than $900 million in authorized share repurchases remaining when both programs are considered.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, plus non-cash benefits from stock-based compensation accounting, and excluding unusual non-recurring items. In the second quarter, free cash flow came in at $110 million after funding $17 million of capital. Excluded from this amount was $5 million of investment associated with major facility expansion and a one-time $21 million pension contribution in Europe. Accounts receivable days outstanding stood at 78 days this quarter, up 2 days from the second quarter last year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $6 million in comparison to the first quarter to accommodate new ASMS product launches.","Now I will discuss our 2014 full-year outlook. For the second half of 2014, we anticipate positive new product momentum, a continuation of growth in our pharmaceutical markets and in our recurring revenues, and we also anticipate a general improvement in our Chinese business. With these dynamics in play, we expect to finish the year with a mid-single-digit topline sales growth. On the currency translation front and at current exchange rates, we are estimating that our full year \u2013 that for the full year, currency will be approximately neutral to sales growth.","Moving down the P&L, gross margins for the full year are expected to be between 58.5% and 59% as we anticipate stronger than previously envisioned headwinds from foreign currency. In particular, the British pound which has continued to strengthen year-to-date. Operating expenses at constant currency are expected to be up moderately from 2013 levels and below our sales growth. Moving down to the operated \u2013 moving below the operating profit line, net interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million, and we expect our full-year operating tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%.","Turning to share count, our full year average diluted share count is expected to be reduced to around 48.5 million shares outstanding as a result of our continued\u2026","Douglas Berthiaume","Not 48.","Gene Cassis","I\u2019m sorry 84, I\u2019m sorry, 84.5 million shares outstanding as a result of continued share repurchases. Thank you, Doug. Rolling all of this together, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.40. As we think about our expectations for the third quarter of 2014, we anticipate organic sales growth to come in at or above mid-single-digit range. Currency translation at today\u2019s rate would be about neutral to sales growth. This level of sales growth is expected to result in operating leverage that is less than what we delivered in the second quarter. This is due to the timing of variable compensation expenses in the base year. For the third quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be within a range of $1.22 to $1.32. That\u2019s it. Thank you. Doug?","Douglas Berthiaume","Thank you, Gene. And operator, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Doug, could you elaborate on what you saw in terms of mass spec demand on a year-over-year basis and give us some more color both across technology verticals and end markets? One of your competitors had cited strength in the academic market, curious what you saw there?","Douglas Berthiaume","Sure. Overall, the underlying strength in our mass spec business was somewhat camouflaged by the lateness of the orders. So, overall we saw mid to high single-digit orders rate growth, but particularly in China, a lot of those orders came in late in the quarter and you didn\u2019t see it reflected in revenue. So I think, we are seeing good decent demand. ASMS came a little later this year than it normally does, so we did see some customers delaying decision-making, and some of that I think clearly slipped out of the second quarter, and we\u2019ll see more momentum on those new introductions coming in the second half of the year. Gene, do you want to talk about the academic dynamics or at least the --?","Gene Cassis","Yes, it\u2019s interesting that in the first half of last year, we had particularly strong academic uptick in our SYNAPT and QTof business in Europe, and of course that\u2019s in the base this year. Now, we\u2019re beginning to see sort of an echo effect in the U.S. as governmental spending in the U.S. is better funded this year. So, I would say that, key leading dynamics are improved spending by governmental accounts for high-end mass spectrometry products in the U.S., and another thing that we\u2019re seeing again in the U.S. is a nice uptick in both quadrupole and orthogonal time of flight in the pharmaceutical area. So, I would say that as Doug mentioned, we ended up seeing some demand late in the quarter, particularly from China, that wasn\u2019t reflected in sales but is in the order book, and we suffered from a little bit of a tough base of comparison in Europe just given the particular strength that we had during the first half of 2013.","Douglas Berthiaume","And I would say Brandon, in terms of underlying symptoms, we\u2019re seeing very strong interest particularly out of academic medical centers for very large programs that anticipate investments in mass spectrometry. I would say in terms of leading indicators, that\u2019s a strong and early dynamic or symptom that we\u2019ve seen recently, so that\u2019s encouraging.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","","Thanks, that is helpful. And then one for Gene. Could you quantify the impact of currency on the EPS line both in the second quarter and as well as what\u2019s baked into your full-year guidance at this point? And then could you quantify the impact of M&A on the TA segment in 2Q on the revenue line?","","Gene Cassis","","Yes, if I look at the first half of the \u2013 of this year, we probably had a total effect year-over-year of about $0.10 that we can attribute to currency, and most of that came in the first quarter because we had a more meaningful yen comparison in the first quarter. So we probably had about $0.01 headwind from currency in the second quarter. Looking at the full year, you\u2019re likely to see currency during the remaining -- during the remaining two quarters become a slight headwind, a few cents, fortunately largely offset from a more favorable tax rate this year. So, the negative effect of currency on our EPS is largely offset by the positive on the tax rate. I think for the full year, if I take a look at the effect of M&A, you\u2019re likely to see the major contribution from our TA instruments division. You will recall they acquired four smaller companies last year, and we\u2019re beginning to see the positive impact of those acquisitions in the second quarter, and my estimate is that we might benefit around 50 basis points this year on the topline, primarily from TA acquisitions.","Douglas Berthiaume","","And the second quarter impact was $2 million to $3 million.","Gene Cassis","","It was a little bit higher. It was a little bit more than half of the TA growth in sales that we can attribute to these acquired companies, but again, if I look at the underlying order dynamics, it\u2019s looking as if about half of the growth that we get from TA this year will be M&A or acquired businesses and the other half organic.","Brandon Couillard \u2013 Jefferies","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Good morning. So you indicated in your prepared remarks that part of the recovery in the second quarter was driven by recapturing of revenue not captured in Q1, and you seemed to point largely to U.S. pharma, and clearly while you indicated China got better in terms of orders, at the end of the quarter it didn't help you at the revenue line. So it seems like when you are talking about the recapturing, you are talking about U.S. pharma, but when I go back to what you described during the quarter talking about the $20 million Q1 miss, about $15 million of that was attributed to China and $5 million was attributed to TA backlog. And usually when I think of recapturing revenue, I think the incremental margin is going to be a lot better, so I'm just trying to figure out the disconnect here. It does seem like there is a little bit of a disconnect in the explanation, and really importantly as I think about looking ahead, it is definitely great to hear that China is getting better, but it is hard for me to understand exactly what is going on with Waters in the bio-pharma end market. Are things getting better or was there just a recapturing of revenue?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Well, just to -- just to go back and look at the first quarter momentarily right in the $20 million miss, and we had described that as about half of that attributed to slower order growth in China. We had about $5 million associated with the backlog build at TA and another $5 million that we attributed largely to just business shifting in pharma from the first quarter into the second quarter, so it was about a $5 million issue that we were talking about in terms of order slippage and sales slippage. If I take a look at where we are through the first half of this year, the pharmaceutical -- global biopharmaceutical growth is up around 5%, so the strength that we saw in the second quarter of 8% growth in sales does contain some of that business that we might have -- you might think of as first-quarter business. So, going forward, Doug, I would say that a way to think about it is that for the first half, we grew at a nice, mid-single-digit range. We think that that is a logical outlook for the second half of the year.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","","Okay that is helpful. And then, I guess just a couple cleanups. OpEx increased $10 million relative to Q1, we haven\u2019t seen that since 2011. Most of this was at the SG&A line. I understand some of this was at least FX year-over-year, but I wouldn\u2019t think that would make a huge difference sequentially, so I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle on, are there particular areas where you guys are stepping up investment and is this catch up or is it opportunistic as you see some signs of promise in particular areas?","Gene Cassis","","Well, it had a few components to it Doug. When you look at the business sequentially, you have to realize that we do have married increases that kick in at the first of April. So, you have that and of course that\u2019s in the base quarter last quarter. And you\u2019re right, there is a foreign currency impact that we have, particularly the pound and the euro, both of those hit us in the second quarter and contributed about 2 percentage points of growth on the SG&A line. On top of that and you also have the effect of the acquired businesses at TA, it is not a big effect, but you do have more operating run rate expenses associated with those companies that we acquired last year.","Douglas Berthiaume","","And the revenue hasn\u2019t really totally kicked in at this point.","Gene Cassis","","Yes. So, those we think are the major components of the SG&A increase.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","","Okay. And very last one, I don\u2019t think you gave a specific to one decimal point contribution from M&A and FX in the quarter. Would you be willing to break those out?","Douglas Berthiaume","","FX was 1 point, and M&A was less than 1 point, it was about three quarters of a point.","Gene Cassis","","Yes, it was about 70 basis points from M&A in the quarter, but again it was \u2013 it\u2019s kind of particular to the shipments that we made in the quarter. If I take a look at the underlying impact of the TA acquired businesses, you\u2019re going to be closer to 50 basis points for the year.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","","Okay, thank you.","Gene Cassis","","Welcome.","Operator: Thank you. Next question is Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","Good morning guys. I want to dig in a little bit more again just on sort of China and the rest of Asia, and it seems like developing markets kind of getting better across the portfolio. Usually, that would sort of be feeding off at least as we think to Asia off of China. I guess in terms of the weakness there, particularly on the government end, are we still seeing some of the delays just in terms of budget approvals on high end CapEx, you know say over $50,000 type items where it\u2019s really the sign off process that is just taking time given some of the anti-corruption probe and sort of concerns? And secondarily, when you are seeing some of the order pickup or order improvement, you are feeling more comfortable, is some of that activity that should've happened in the first half that is now getting signed so there is a bit of a catchup or do you think just underlying improvement is kind of happening as just -- there are some releases but demand is also coming back?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Well Ross, you asked a number of questions in there. First of all, the overall Asia business, ex-China, as a matter of fact, the overall developing world definitely saw an uptick in the quarter. Of particular note I would say is India where we\u2019ve been struggling with the political dynamics, the strength of the rupee or the weakness I should. We clearly saw a turn in India, and we\u2019ve continued to see that as we go into the second half. So, I think the symptoms in India are very positive. In China, we think that we\u2019ve seen a clear turnaround in the underlying dynamics of the orders in the revenue cycle. It came in the latter part of the quarter and it particularly turned up in the last few weeks, and needless to say we\u2019re continuing to monitor that, we monitor the China organization, look at the drop sheets. We think we have seen very clear symptoms that the overall tenor of that marketplace has improved. Now, how much we recapture from what maybe could have been a run rate basis in the first half, right now we are not counting on a doubling up of what happens in China. We\u2019re anticipating that this turn that we saw late in the quarter is going to continue to build some momentum as we go through the rest of the year. We clearly see a number of signs that that\u2019s likely to happen. We think the issues that existed is related to a crackdown on corruption kind of was a general dynamic that affected a lot of business in China wasn\u2019t necessarily focused on the lab and analytical marketplace, and to that extent, maybe we have seen it leave that area of the marketplace sooner than some others, but clearly we are more optimistic as we go into the second half.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","","And maybe taking off something Doug said earlier, I mean as we think about the margin line, I mean it seems like the last 12, 18 months have really been characterized a lot by sort of FX movements and sort of a drain, but we have been sort of hovering in this high 20\u2019s area of margin now for a while. I think you hit 29.5 on an annual basis back in \u201811 and that was kind of the peak. I mean as you think about peak margins in this business or the multi-year opportunity and how that translates into kind of your multi-year view on earnings growth, I mean has anything else in the business changed around what you think this model can kind of deliver, and if we stripped out all the noise on FX the last several quarters, anything else of note that you would point out from an incremental perspective that in your mind has kind of changed?","Gene Cassis","","I think that during the time period you\u2019re focusing on, Ross, I think one of the things to bear in mind is that the overall pharmaceutical growth was somewhat less than historical averages typically for Waters Corporation. The pharmaceutical segment has grown at the same rate as the corporation as a whole, and over the past couple of years has been a little bit of a point off the line. We\u2019re kind of encouraged with the trends that we see this year where pharmaceutical seems to be picking up. There is a certain ebb and flow in the business dynamics for that market, and I think that an important component of getting the leverage that we need at the operating profit line is going to be a more sustainable growth trajectory for the pharmaceutical segment.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","","Got it. Thanks Gene.","Gene Cassis","","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Paul Knight with Janney Capital Markets.","Paul Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Hi Gene, you had mentioned that the European academic market was down in the second quarter. What was the dynamic last year, a large order flow last year? What do you see in Europe creating that, I think you mentioned down here in 2Q?","Gene Cassis","","I think there was a convergence of positives last year in that the funding, the funding was there and we had a very exciting product in our SYNAPT G2. And so, we were encouraged that that combined to have a very positive effect for us in Europe last year. We\u2019re beginning, as I mentioned before, to see a little bit of an echo of that in the U.S. this year. We believe that the product story is just as compelling and with the funding being better we\u2019re optimistic for the second half of this year.","Paul Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","And then in China, you had mentioned, you know the corruption issue has been a major deal consolidation of agencies. You seem pretty confident about 2H, is it the orders or anything else you see in China?","Gene Cassis","","Well, you know, if you look at the business in China and think about the non-governmental businesses, the occidental companies that have footprint there as well as the more chemical and food safety business, those businesses have done well all along. So, it\u2019s been the governmentally-funded businesses in particularly around the greater Beijing area where we\u2019ve seen most of the problem. And late in the second quarter, we began to see some orders break through on that front, and I don\u2019t think -- we\u2019re not deep enough into this release process to be able to call a new trajectory on demand, but it\u2019s certainly more encouraging that we began to see some of these bigger ticket items start to flow through into sales.","Douglas Berthiaume","","We\u2019re also seeing Paul, our customers act a little bit more confident as we go into the second half. So, that\u2019s another point on the line that encourages us.","Paul Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","And then lastly, the healthcare market here in U.S., is it pharmaceutical better or is it biotech better?","Gene Cassis",""," Well, it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s more of the spec pharmaceutical, it\u2019s more of bio. The particular strength that we had in higher-end mass spectrometry in the U.S. is more indicative of the -- more of the biotech business. The large pharmaceutical firms that currently make up something in the range of around 10% of our sales had a rather lackluster year-over-year performance. So, it is more specialty pharmaceutical biotech and generics that are showing strength.","Douglas Berthiaume","","And clinical too continues to be a pretty robust area particularly in areas of drugs of abuse testing and areas like that.","Paul Knight \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey thanks. Just to clarify on guidance, you know bringing down the high end of the range by $0.10, is that just simply a catch up from the first quarter miss? I mean, obviously the end markets are improving a bit, you\u2019ve got a lower tax rate, and you have got the restructuring initiatives, are there other factors in there in the back half of the year or is this simply recalibrating from the first quarter?","Gene Cassis","","No, I think when we gave guidance on the first quarter, the high-end of the guidance, anticipated that the issue in China would be resolved, and although we\u2019re encouraged with some of the late quarter trends that we saw, we still had a sales decline in China. So as you begin to think about a recovery and as the year \u2013 what remains in the year gets shorter and shorter, I think it\u2019s only wise to be a little bit more conservative. The other thing is that we\u2019re seeing a little bit more pressure on the currency front, and depending on how product mix materializes for the full year, that could have a little bit of a drag. So, we thought that, that this range that we have right now, maybe has a little bit of conservatism in it. It doesn\u2019t anticipate a full recovery in China, and it does anticipate that we could have a little bit of headwind on the currency front.","Douglas Berthiaume","","But if you look at the tone of your question Tycho, I do think you \u2013 we are more optimistic than pessimistic about these estimates, I would say.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan","","I know you had a question on China before, but as we think about -- I mean the tone at ASMS on China was pretty negative, Gene, so can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of the momentum you\u2019re seeing there?","Gene Cassis","","Yes. I think we really can\u2019t talk about that until we have a little bit more clarity on that front, Tycho. I mean we are encouraged that very late in the quarter, and you\u2019re right, post-ASMS we began to see some of these orders break through, but again I think it makes sense to be cautiously optimistic that this is the beginning of more improved business conditions. Fortunately, we are seeing the nice uptick in India offset. We saw it offset some of the China weakness in the second quarter, and frankly the business trajectory in India looks pretty strong, so there could be a little bit of an upside for us during the second half of the year.","Douglas Berthiaume","","So I think the other thing in China, just another piece of positive data is that we\u2019re talking to a few of the large clinical research centers that we know are favored in terms of the funding initiatives in China. We feel very close to some large commitments from those [tenors] (ph). The timing is a little bit unclear, but we weren\u2019t looking at that as strongly a quarter ago versus today. So, you know, more than a few points on a line that point to positive activity in China.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay, and then lastly Gene, can you just comment on the $6 million in restructuring in one-timers, and how should we think about additional restructuring initiatives going forward?","Gene Cassis","","I don\u2019t think you should think about additional restructuring. There is nothing in the second half of this year that I see.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan","","Thank you.","Gene Cassis","","It was a first quarter dynamic, yeah, welcome.","Operator","","Thank you. Next question, Jon Groberg of Macquarie.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","Thanks, good morning. Hey Doug, from the tone around the CEO search, it sounds like this may take a little bit longer than you initially anticipated. I think oftentimes we think these things are going to go quicker. Can you maybe just give us a little bit more color around kind of what you are seeing there and maybe why you think it could take a little longer?","Douglas Berthiaume","","I\u2019m not sure. From my perspective, it\u2019s going about as I expected Jon. The process just -- you\u2019ve got Directors involved, it\u2019s not a one man initiative. So, you know, you\u2019ve got to go through the process of identifying all the players and vet them and then reference check them. That is mainly the reason why I provided such a long window of transition, so I think we are right where I expected. We have had some good strong interviews with very viable candidates, but it is just the process grinds it down finer and finer, so I fully anticipate that within the window I\u2019ve described, we will have a very good candidate. We\u2019re continuing to vet both internal and external candidates, but it\u2019s going to still take some time. I think I wouldn\u2019t want or lead you to believe that we\u2019ll have an announcement anytime in the next few months.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Doug, also if you look at your balance sheet, I mean your net cash continues to build again. I know that you noted you are going to make a technology acquisition. I guess the question is are you -- you mentioned you are still committed to the buyback, but obviously you have given your cash outside the U.S. I mean it continues to build up. So I guess, I'm just trying to think about is there any shift in terms of what you want to do with that cash, and is this technology acquisition large enough that is it dilutive, is it contemplated in your guidance? I'm just trying to understand, I guess, your, kind of, cash, if there is any shift there around your cash [view] (ph)?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Frankly, Jon there is no shift around our view. We continue to believe that it\u2019s unlikely that we will do anything in substantive terms that increases the risk quotient in our business. We continue to believe that long-term we\u2019ve got excellent opportunities to continue to grow the business at an organic rate that\u2019s in the high-single digits. It\u2019s going to continue to produce outstanding free cash flow, and certainly if there is anything near the current price of our stock, we think it\u2019s a good deal. So, we\u2019ll continue to focus on the buybacks. The technology deal that we\u2019re going to talk about with the press release is fully anticipated in our forecast for earnings and sales. It\u2019s not going to impact our sales in the short-term, but it is a very highly anticipated technology transaction largely focused in the mass spec and long-term in the clinical arena. So, we continue to think long-term. We are not looking at acquiring businesses, cost reducing, and leveraging the short-term. I think we\u2019ll continue to do what we\u2019ve done for years, and I think in the long run, you wake up, we\u2019ll have fewer shares outstanding and we\u2019ll be leveraging the bottom line in a way we have historically.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","","And a lot of your customers are looking at \u2013 on the pharma side are doing inversions to be able to have more access to their cash, it sounds like that\u2019s not something you are contemplating?","Douglas Berthiaume","","It\u2019s highly unlikely, I would say. We certainly wouldn\u2019t be interested in doing it from a tax rate perspective, obviously inversions give you some additional ability to use your cash outside the U.S., but I would say that\u2019s an unlikely scenario for us.","Jon Groberg - Macquarie","","Okay thanks.","Operator","","Dan Leonard with Leerink.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink","Great, thank you. I could use some more color on how important the new mass spec launches are to your second-half outlook. I think Doug, you mentioned meaningful shipments are anticipated, but is there any way you can further quantify?","Gene Cassis","","It\u2019s interesting that the two benchtop instruments that we have I think fit into a sweet spot within the mass spectrometry market. They are directed nicely at regulated testing. Clearly, I think they will represent significant shipment volume. It is not likely that there will be heavy cannibalization of our high-end TQ-S system. So, as we looked across our product line and thought about the sequence of introductions that we\u2019ve had over the past few years, we clearly recognize that some of these value priced, value performance segment of the market probably required a new product introduction, and we feel confident that from initial customer reception of these devices that we\u2019re going to be in a nice position there. In addition, Doug had alluded to the ionKey technology as being an important innovation in mass spectrometry, and I think it\u2019s the combination of ionKey technology and these new benchtop devices along with the TQ-S also makes a very interesting opportunity for us.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink","","Got it, that\u2019s helpful color. And for my follow-up Doug, could you elaborate on a comment you made in response to Brandon\u2019s question earlier. You mentioned there are some very large programs that academic medical centers that anticipate mass spec investments. Could you talk a bit more about that, what are the applications and what specifically is happening on the field?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Yes, I would say without mentioning specific names, we are looking at more large research programs in the academic medical center area than we probably ever have, and I would say they are closer to fruition than many of these discussions typically are. I would say they -- you\u2019ve all been exposed to the dramatic increase in investment in genomics that\u2019s going on. I think you\u2019re beginning to see a similar type of focus on phenomics or whether it\u2019s down to proteomics or metabolomics of looking what\u2019s going on in specific phenome centers that are taking on kind of comparable levels of anticipated investment. Well, we have certainly done some of that with Imperial College in London and building on that relationship, we\u2019re seeing a great deal of interest apparent in other centers around the globe, you know not limited to the United States. Limited -- also showing up in Asia and in \u2013 and interestingly in areas of the Middle East also. So, I\u2019m very encouraged by it -- this investment that we are going to announce this afternoon further complements our activity in that area, so we\u2019re building a portfolio that I think is going to be pretty impressive to answer the needs in these emerging research areas.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","The next question is Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks for taking the question. Just one on the guidance here. It does assume in your guidance I think for an acceleration in the organic growth rate in the second half as we just kind of look at the first half versus the full-year assumptions. And the reason I'm asking the question is the comps that you have are considerably tougher in the fourth quarter versus third quarter on a year-over-year basis for organic growth. So, I just want to get a sense of what kind of organic growth assumptions are contemplated in your third quarter guidance?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Yes. Gene can flesh it out, but I think if you look at our all-in first half growth rate, we\u2019re looking at roughly the same anticipated growth rate in the second half. We certainly had a very low growth rate in the first quarter, and that kicked up to high-single -- mid-single digits, I would say, in the second quarter. We anticipate our growth rate to be higher in the third quarter than it will be in the fourth quarter largely for the dynamics you cited, Isaac, that the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter last year. It\u2019s not impossible to have another very strong quarter, but the reality is when you\u2019ve got a tough compare, it\u2019s probably wiser to anticipate leavening of that. So, I don\u2019t think the second half is anticipated in our guidance to be much different than what we have seen in the first half, and to be fair I mean, I would say we\u2019re probably [err] (ph), the reality could be a little bit better than that. I think right now we\u2019re running a little bit stronger than that, but we\u2019re careful given the fact that China doesn\u2019t have that many points on the line, and it\u2019s still an important part of our worldwide revenue.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Got it. And maybe just a follow-up, product specific question. Curious if you can comment on the market for medical cannabis testing. That is an area where we\u2019ve seen what looks to be pretty interesting uptick in demand for your products, so I would be curious what the contribution was either it\u2019s whether this quarter or year-to-date, just the current impact and outlook for that business specifically?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Yes. It is an area that we are optimistic about. We think that it\u2019s reasonable to provide the products particularly to help in the overall characterization and quality control of that marketplace. Of course, it\u2019s now limited to a small handful of geographies around the United States. In the quarter, it wasn\u2019t a material number, certainly not a point, much less than a point of revenue for us, but we think it has the opportunity to grow into an eight figured revenue number. This year, it could press that, so that means the second half would be stronger than the first half. We certainly are responding to a level of requests, particularly in the extraction area of our business, where we have a pretty strong position with supercritical fluid. So, I would say, I think the second half is going to be stronger than the first half, and I think it\u2019s going to be a multi-year opportunity for us, but it will probably be a few quarters before we\u2019ll talk about it being, you know a $4 million or $5 million business.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Got it. Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","","The next question comes from the Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","Hi, good morning. Just a question on competition. I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing on (inaudible) sides of the business around competitive dynamics, particularly in China?","Douglas Berthiaume","","I would say the competitive dynamics in China across the product lines haven\u2019t changed very much. We haven\u2019t seen -- we\u2019ve seen a few of our customers, our competitors show up in the news because of transgressions, but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve seen that have a dramatic effect on the competitive issues, so I\u2019d say it is kind of no news both on the mass spec front and on the chromatography front in China. It\u2019s almost totally a customer dynamic that we are willing to talk about China. And the rest of world, I would say chromatography is a remarkably consistent competitive arena, don\u2019t see too many ripples on that wave front. On the mass spec front, you see some ebbs and flows from quarter-to-quarter. We probably ebbed a little in the early part of this year. We think we are beginning to flow more as ASMS comes behind us, and we see a number of these very large initiatives beginning to pay fruit, so that\u2019s probably what I\u2019m seeing on the competitive front.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","","And just on the columns, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about attach rates in the past between HPLC and UPLC, are those still basically the same? And is there -- are you seeing any \u2013 especially on the UPLC side, just given that you have a higher attach rate, is there a potential for that to maybe change going forward?","Gene Cassis","","Well I think the biggest dynamic on that front, Amanda, in the long run, I could see the migration of UPLC into quality control methods, and that\u2019s a multi-year process, because the usage of columns is so much higher when you\u2019re running a regulated method like that. But we\u2019re very excited about the trajectory for our new line of CORTECS columns. It seems to have a significant performance advantage, and it complements the other column chemistries that we offer on the UPLC and HPLC front.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","","Got it. And then just on the, I guess a product specific question as well on the QDA, I think you\u2019ve talked about that being adding about a percent of growth, is that still what you\u2019re looking for?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Yes the \u2013 what we, the results that we have for the first half of the year are consistent with that vision.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","","Okay, thanks very much.","Douglas Berthiaume","","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo.","Tim Evans \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi thanks. Gene, I\u2019m a little confused on the comments about the contribution from your recent acquisitions, I think in response to Brandon\u2019s question, you indicated that there was about $5 million of revenue there, and then later on you said it was more like 70 bps in the quarter. $5 million looks to me like it would be over a point of growth in the quarter and assuming that you get more revenue in the back-half of the year from these acquisitions, which I think has been your forecast, you would be looking at more than a point of growth for the full year from these acquisitions. And so, I\u2019m just trying to understand what the right number is on that and how that relates to your mid-single-digit revenue growth guidance?","Gene Cassis","","Yes, Tim, I know that the number of $5 million was in an answer to a question and I know that 70 bps was an answer to a question. But I don\u2019t think the two of them are together, because you\u2019re right that\u2019s inconsistent. And that the TA instruments business is roughly 12% of the corporation sales. So understanding that we\u2019re anticipating a mid-to-high single-digit growth rate for that division this year and on top of that understanding that we\u2019re anticipating that half of it is organic and half of it is acquired business. I think you can do the numbers and certainly it doesn\u2019t equate to a $5 million per quarter.","Douglas Berthiaume","","But simply put the acquisition revenue in the second quarter was something around $2 million, $2.5 million. So the effect of acquired revenue was less than a half, it is mostly half a point probably a little bit less. It\u2019s now that that\u2019s going to ramp up in the second half, we fully believe.","Tim Evans \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Okay, so when we think about your full year organic growth what should we be thinking about?","Gene Cassis","","Yes, mid-single-digit and assume about 50 basis points worth of contribution from M&A.","Tim Evans \u2013 Wells Fargo","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Baird.","Jeff Elliott \u2013 Baird","Good morning, thanks for the question. First question is on Japan, little bit softer the second quarter, how should we think about growth in the second half?","Gene Cassis","","I think we should think about it as maybe a little bit less robust than what we delivered for the first half, through the first half the constant currency growth rate was about 8%, I would say in the second half we are encouraged by what we see as improved business dynamics in the four profit sectors of that market. And understanding that in terms of government supported research we have a kind of the tough base of comparison given the performance that we had for that segment in the prior year. So, overall we\u2019re probably expecting Japan to be maybe close to mid-single-digit, maybe a little bit less than mid-single-digit. But certainly positive growth with the growth being driven from the industrial chemical and pharmaceutical segments of that market.","Jeff Elliott \u2013 Baird","","And Gene two quick modeling questions, first on Easter in the quarter did you see any impact there, particularly in the columns business? And then the pension contribution in the quarter, should that have an impact on the P&L going forward?","Gene Cassis","","I don\u2019t think either of them are material.","Jeff Elliott \u2013 Baird","","Okay, thank you.","Gene Cassis","","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Given the current shift from big pharma to smaller biotech and especially pharma that are currently driving growth within the U.S. biopharma market. Have you made any changes to your sales force or how you think about the sales process?","Douglas Berthiaume","","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s been significant, the big pharma piece of our business has been under pressure for a number of years. So we have both in our product development and in our operating both in service and in sales have been, turning that organization to focus more and more on biological applications. And so that\u2019s been a kind of a natural dynamic that\u2019s occurred in our business both in the United States and to some extent in Europe. So it hasn\u2019t resulted in a huge twerking of the new organization just kind of, minor tweaks.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","","Okay. And are you seeing any changes in demand yet due to M&A by pharma customers and particularly demand for instrument versus the demand for consumables?","Douglas Berthiaume","","I wouldn\u2019t say that we have seen of course in big pharma recently, you have seen more attempts at M&A rather than the too much actual M&A. certainly in the Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal would have changed that. I would say that nothing unusual, I would say it\u2019s more business as usual in big pharma.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities ","Doug just come back to China, just the macro level. Have you taken [shareholder] using share and what\u2019s been happening to pricing in the last couple of years?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Pricing has been largely stable I would say Peter. We haven\u2019t seen any significant change in margins in China been remarkably consistent in comparable to our margins elsewhere in the world. Competitively, I think I touched on it in the previous question, and some of our competitors have run into minor or not so minor legal issues. So that had to deal with some of those, we have of course not gone with, did not run into similar kinds of issues. But on balance I don\u2019t think the competitive dynamics in the LC area have changed very much that we are all still there and it\u2019s competitive. I think some of our competitors tend to use price more aggressively, but we haven\u2019t seen that affect our business to any great extent. The mass spec arena all the major players are there, I would say we more than hold our own and continue to believe that the dynamics that we see are customer related not competitor related.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities ","Got it. And the late booking of the Chinese order, that sounds like it\u2019s just purely a late order as opposed to any kind of internal slip?","Douglas Berthiaume","","I\u2019m sorry I missed the first part of that.","Gene Cassis","","You know talking about the\u2026","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities ","Late booked order from China.","Douglas Berthiaume","","Wasn\u2019t just one late booked order, it was \u2013 this whole process where I would say for the first part of the quarter in China we continued to the effects of the focus on corruption and the fear in the part of customers is that how the government was treating people. So, everything that checked and double checked and the effect of that was to drag out the, process of doing a demonstration, getting the customer to do the paper work for an order and getting that order cleared. We didn\u2019t see that the customer was all of a sudden looking at four competitors, because they didn\u2019t like our product that kind of thing was all is internal dynamic and that\u2019s what we saw begin to loosen up as we worked our way through the quarter. To be fair our organization anticipated, they are in the ground they are talking to customers, they are talking to the government officials, and they saw internally and forecast that the process would begin to loosen up and in fact it did and those orders begin to flow late in the quarter. But, you have to get find the financing cleared, you have to get the products move from our manufacturing side on to China and that just happened too late in the quarter to facilitate those orders.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities ","Got you. And then the signs you talked about in Asia that was part of \u2013 that was a large part of that confidence coming back to those customers and just kind of break through in government orders was there anything else?","Douglas Berthiaume","","I would say that dynamic in China was really the overall dynamic, we did have a significant. We do built throughout our business in the quarter, but that one in China was the one that was related to this whole process of government intervention.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities ","But I\u2019m just\u2026","Douglas Berthiaume","","I think since we\u2019re well over an hour here, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","","Our final question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, good morning. Just one quick one, I just sort of want to clarify and just make sure I understand, and this is sort of related to what Isaac was asking about the comps in the back-half of the year about 10% organic revenue comp in Q4 and that include some contributions from the QDA launch already. And so just if I\u2019m sort of sifting through the commentary in the Q&A, is part of that is that your confidence since you\u2019re getting and being able to beat that number or deliver on the organic revenue growth is that large multisystem orders is that what I saw here you\u2019re hitting that or it is just sort of steady growth and improvement in the overall market in the year end? Basically, are you expecting some large multisystem orders in mass spec in Q4?","Douglas Berthiaume","","Those, we may get some large orders Derik in the second half of the year. However, those are not baked into the expectations that are included in our guidance. I would say that, you\u2019re absolutely correct that the, from a growth point of view it is a 10% growth quarter in debate. But there is another way to look at the base year and understand that on a percentage base the fourth quarter last year represented about 30% of the annual sales. In that regard it is not that atypical when you look at the natural quarterization of our business where typically the first quarter is 20% to 22%, the two middle quarters are around 25% and the fourth quarter is typically in the 28% to 30%. So it is a little bit on the high side, but when you look at the quarter, when you look at the base of comparison using percent of business across the quarters, it doesn\u2019t look quite as steep as it might when you just look at growth rates, which in terms have a dependants on what the 2012 year look like.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Great.","Douglas Berthiaume","","That\u2019s largely because of that strong base that you will see as you derive with our anticipated growth rates, we\u2019ve taken our anticipated growth rate in the fourth quarter down to the lower single-digit. So, we clearly expect the growth to be stronger in the third quarter tempered because, of the strong base in the fourth quarter. And we think that\u2019s very reasonable.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Great, okay that\u2019s actually what I was heading for. Great, thanks a lot, I appreciate it.","Douglas Berthiaume","Welcome.","Gene Cassis","Welcome.","Douglas Berthiaume","Well, thank you all for sticking with us through this extended timeframe.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Douglas Berthiaume, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Waters Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you. Well, good morning, and welcome to the Waters Corporation Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. With me on today's call is, as usual, John Ornell, Waters' Chief Financial Officer; Art Caputo, the President of the Waters Division; and Gene Cassis, the Vice President of Investor Relations.","As is our normal practice, I will start with an overview of the quarter's highlights, and John will follow with details of our financial results and provide you with our outlook for the third quarter and full year. Before we get going, I'd like John to cover the cautionary language.","John A. Ornell","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future income statement results of the company this time for Q3 and full year 2013. We caution you that all such statements are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.","For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see our 10-K annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, in Part 1 under the caption Business Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release and 8-K. We further caution you that the company does not obligate or commit itself by providing this guidance to update predictions. We do not plan to update predictions regarding possible future income statement results, except during our regularly scheduled earnings release, conference calls and webcasts. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 2013.","During this call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is attached to the earnings release issued this morning. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to pro forma results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule entitled Reconciliation of Net Income Per Diluted Share, included in this morning's press release.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Well, our sales growth rate in the second quarter slowed from what we delivered earlier in the year and was below the outlook that we shared with you on the April call. If you look at the quarter, our constant-currency sales grew about 2% and our adjusted earnings per share were down 8% from the prior year's second quarter results. Needless to say, these results are well below our prior expectations.","I want to start off by discussing our instrument system results and specifically the weaker-than-anticipated finish that we saw for this segment of our business. Looking back at the first quarter, our instrumentation business grew organically at about 8%, and the similarly healthy growth trend was maintained through most of the second quarter.","However, in the closing 2 weeks of the quarter, orders booking rates surprisingly and atypically slowed, as customers, primarily in the U.S., delayed issuing orders to us for capital goods. In addition, overseas orders received late in June could not be converted into revenue prior to the end of the quarter.","As we had in the first quarter, we again increased our backlog in this quarter, but even more significantly. In fact, through the first 6 months of this year we have built about $20 million in backlog, and that's about double the volume we had anticipated. Following the close of the second quarter, we performed a thorough analysis of orders and backlog and confirmed our ability to convert these orders to sales in the second half of 2013. In the full year sales growth outlook that we will supply to you later in this call, please note that we will remain cautious on instrument order growth rates in the second half in response to less predictable purchasing patterns in the first half of 2013, but we will include sales revenue associated with the planned reduction in backlog levels.","Turning now to an analysis of our second quarter sales. Constant-currency sales growth for the Waters Division was 3%, as flat growth in the combined government and academic end market offset mid-single digit pharmaceutical sales growth. Our chemical analysis sales growth rate was in the low-single digits. Comparing these results to assumptions embedded in our guidance, slower-than-expected growth in pharmaceutical instrument system demand substantially contributed to our revenue shortfall.","Geographically and for the Waters Division, sales growth in the U.S. was most affected by this late quarter slowdown and consequently finished the quarter marginally down. U.S. pharmaceutical sales in the quarter were flat, with robust recurring revenue growth offset by a decline in instrument system sales. U.S. government and academic sales growth was under pressure, while sales for chemical analysis applications were up at a high-single digit rate.","In general, our developing markets in Latin America continued to perform well in the second quarter in comparison to mixed results that we saw throughout 2012. Sales growth in Europe was relatively strong and slightly ahead of our expectations. Most notably, government and academic spending for mass spectrometry-based instruments was up at a double-digit rate, while pharma and industrial revenue growth was largely in line with our expectations and up at a mid-single digit rate.","Waters Division constant-currency sales in Japan were down slightly in the quarter, with a strong uptick in academic spending largely offsetting declines in pharmaceutical and chemical end markets. The strength in academic and government business that we began to see late in the quarter is related to supplemental governmental stimulus programs, and we are encouraged by the prospect that these programs will continue and contribute to growth in our Japanese business in the second half of 2013.","Asian sales outside of Japan benefited from a strong performance by our Chinese business, where we enjoyed double-digit sales growth, with strong performance by all customer key segments, including pharmaceutical firms.","Indian sales were flat in the quarter as fluctuations in local currency valuation adversely impacted demand from generic drug makers. Our sales in Asian markets outside of Japan, China and India were generally weaker in the quarter than we had planned as demand from these countries is generally more erratic and associated with the shallow global recovery.","For our TA Instruments division, constant-currency sales were down by about 3% in the second quarter and were heavily impacted by a backlog build in the quarter. Instrument demand for high temperature and industrial chemical applications were strong, while biocalorimetry platforms were adversely impacted by reduced governmental and academic spending levels. The backlog generated in the second quarter principally involved orders for high-temperature instrumentation and thermal systems for customers in developing Asian markets. Our second half sales growth outlook for TA is more in line with the ordering trends that we saw in the first half of 2013, and specifically, we are targeting low- to mid-single digit constant-currency revenue growth for the division.","Now I'll discuss some product line dynamics that we saw for the Waters Division in the quarter. Our recurring revenues, the combination of service and chromatography consumables, grew nicely in the second quarter, delivering 8% sales growth before currency effects. This growth rate was consistent across the quarter and suggests healthy instrument utilization rates. ACQUITY columns continue to account for an increasing proportion of our overall column business, and we continue to introduce more ACQUITY column chemistries in the quarter.","Looking at our Waters Division MS instrument system sales, we saw mid-single digit sales growth for UPLC mass spec systems and low double-digit orders growth. Business momentum was strongest through the quarter for high-performance QTof technology systems, including Xevo and SYNAPT platform instruments. Our tandem quadrupole-based instruments delivered strong growth in the quarter and an overall double-digit revenue growth through the first half of 2013.","At this year's ASMS Conference, we showcased the new SYNAPT platform instrument called the SYNAPT G2-Si. This innovative instrument offers significant advantages to researchers, taking to more fully utilize ion mobility measurements across workflows. In applications ranging from lipidomics to food safety analyses, Waters' scientists and our collaborators demonstrated the unique capabilities of high-performance Ion Mobility Separation for challenging qualitative and quantitative measurements.","On the chromatography instrumentation front, we had a weaker-than-anticipated quarter, with overall declines for both orders and sales in the mid-single digits. This weakness was most pronounced for our pharmaceutical companies in well-established markets, U.S., western Europe and Japan, and in application areas outside of pharmaceutical QC. ACQUITY H-Class demand continued to ramp for QC applications, but weakened in early-phase development applications, interestingly, the same type of labs where we saw robust demand for advanced mass spec instruments.","ACQUITY overall and ACQUITY H-Class had particularly strong sales growth in the prior year quarter. The comparisons become easier in the second half of 2013, and as we move into the second half of 2013, we expect to see a return to modest growth for our LC system platforms, with incremental demand for our new ACQUITY advanced polymer characterization system, along with continued ramp of our ACQUITY UPC2 instruments.","So in summarizing our second quarter results, I believe that the underlying demand for our products and services is stronger and more stable than our second quarter sales growth suggests. Late quarter shifts in the product mix and in geographical mix of orders, in combination with the choppy capital spending environment, all converge to disrupt what had appeared through most of the quarter to be a healthy demand trend. Looking toward the future, I am pleased with new system offerings that are on the near horizon.","During the past few years, our R&D efforts have delivered significant new innovative system offerings to the markets that we serve, and there's been a nice correlation between new product launches and higher-than-market sales growth. We have seen this with ACQUITY and are now witnessing the positive effects of the recent mass spec system introductions. To that end, we hope to benefit from new system introductions later in the second half of this year, with the sales impact from these launches contributing more meaningfully to 2014 growth.","Before turning it over to John, I will say a few words about our nonoperational plans. On the M&A front, we will continue to seek smaller complementary technology opportunities that fit our profitability and growth characteristics. Our strategy is to remain a technologically focused company with market-leading offerings for targeted customer sets. We see this as the most viable path of securing long-term growth and leading profitability in the analytical tools business.","We will remain focused on strong free cash generation because we feel that cash generation is the long-term primary goal for any successful enterprise and a key indicator of our current market strength. In terms of cash deployment and after any bolt-on type business acquisitions, we plan to continue our share repurchase program, a plan which has, over the years, removed more than 1\/3 of shares outstanding and meaningfully contributed to predictable EPS growth.","On closing, when I last spoke to you in April, I mentioned that I felt 2013 would be a successful year for Waters. Though the results of the second quarter remind us that the road to success is not always a straight and smooth path, we do remain confident in our product and market positions and anticipate more profitable growth in the second half of the year.","Now here's John for a review of our financials and an update on the financial outlook.","John A. Ornell","Thank you, Doug, and good morning. Second quarter sales grew by 2% before currency translation. Currency translation reduced sales growth by 2%, resulting in flat overall sales. Non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were down 8% to $1.08 this quarter compared to earnings of $1.17 last year.","On a GAAP basis, our earnings were $1.03 this quarter versus $1.09 last year, and reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to our press release issued this morning.","As I just mentioned, before currency translation, sales were up 2%. And looking at this growth geographically, and again before foreign exchange effects, sales within the U.S. were down 2%, Europe sales were up 7%, Japan was down 6% and sales in Asia outside of Japan were up 3% as strong growth in China was offset by weaker sales growth in India and other smaller markets. ROW sales growth in the quarter was strong.","On the product front and in constant currency, within the Waters Division, instrument system sales decreased by 2% and recurring revenues grew by 8% this quarter. Within our TA Instruments division, total sales decreased by 3% versus prior year.","Now I would like to comment on our Q2 non-GAAP financial performance versus prior year. Like last quarter, gross margins continue to be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation and capitalized software amortization. Additionally this quarter, we saw a more pronounced mix shift away from our higher-margin LC instruments in favor of mass spec sales.","SG&A expenses were flat to last year as a result of continued tight spending controls and foreign currency translation. R&D expenses increased by 3% this quarter. On the tax front, our effective operating tax rate for Q2 was about 15%. In the quarter, net interest expense was $6.4 million and share count came in at 86.6 million shares, 2.8 million shares lower than Q2 last year as a result of our continued share repurchase program.","On the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $1,650,000,000 and debt totaled $1,268,000,000, bringing us to a net cash position of about $382 million. In the quarter, the company successfully refinanced its syndicated bank credit facility, increasing the size by $200 million to $1.4 billion and extending the maturity date to June of 2018. As for Q2 share repurchases, we bought 725,000 shares of our common stock at $70 million. This leaves $478 million remaining on the authorized share repurchase program.","We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures plus any noncash tax benefit from stock-based compensation accounting and excluding unusual nonrecurring items. For Q2, free cash flow came in at $95 million, after funding $80 million of CapEx. Excluded from this CapEx amount is $13 million of spend associated with our new Manchester, U.K. mass spectrometry facility. We expect this facility to be ready for occupancy in 2014. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding stood at 74 days this quarter, up 2 days from Q2 last year. And in the quarter, as is typical early in the year, inventories increased by $7 million.","Now looking at the remainder of 2013. While Q2 sales were below expectations, a continuation of the rate of order production from the first half, coupled with the backlog reduction, supports a mid-single digit growth in sales for the second half of the year. We believe our recurring revenues will provide a foundation of stable mid- to high-single digit growth in the second half of the year and our instrument business will see low-single digit growth as CapEx budgets remain under -- remain more constrained and less predictably released in the markets that we serve. Foreign currency translation at today's rates is expected to continue to depress sales by 2% in the second half of the year.","Moving down the P&L. Gross margins for the full year are expected to be about 59.25%, a modest decline due largely to currency translation, software amortization and the instrument mix shift dynamics I discussed earlier. Gross margins in Q3 are expected to be about 58.5%.","Operating expenses are expected to be up about 2% to 3% in the second half of the year, bringing full year growth to about 2%. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, and we expect our full year operating tax rate to be between 14.5% and 15%. Our full year average diluted share count is likely to be around 86.5 million shares outstanding.","Rolling all of this together, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are expected to be in a range of $5 to $5.10. Earnings per share growth continues to be heavily affected by foreign currency translation this year. Versus prior year, foreign currency translation at today's rates is expected to reduce our full year EPS by about $0.30, almost entirely due to the weaker Japanese yen. While we have kept spending controls in place and will for the entire year, it has not been possible to counteract this currency translation effect meaningfully in the short term.","As we think about our expectations for the third quarter of 2013, we expect mid-single digit organic sales growth, supported by orders growth that's consistent with our first half rate in combination with a backlog reduction. Currency translation at today's rates would reduce sales by 2%, resulting in reported sales growth of around 3%. This brings our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.25.","Doug?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Thank you, John. Operator, I think we can now open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Ross Muken of ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess as we think about sort of the progression of the quarter and kind of the outcome, particularly on the capital equipment side, it's interesting that a notable amount of the weakness came from pharma and on the LC side in the U S. It seems like, in general, that's actually been a piece where a lot of folks are talking about kind of a net strengthening or improvement in demand, at least relative to Europe or maybe some of the emerging markets. And so as you sort of went back post -- looking at the outcome for the Q and looked at what you saw in the backlog, I mean, what do you think was kind of the confluence of events that led to that level of disconnect in those pieces of the business versus some of the other areas where you actually came through quite well, where we've seen actually a little bit less stability from other players or from other macro data?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, there's a lot tied up in that comment, Ross. I think, just from a big picture, clearly, the area that surprised us was the weakness in our LC business, particularly in pharmaceutical areas outside of QC, which is, of course, one of the biggest areas that we service. So it was more in the front end of the research area and in discovery, and frankly, that was an area that was quite strong in our mass spec business. So it's a little bit head scratching because it doesn't appear related to large capital outlays, where we were pretty successful. We have seen periods when we -- the confluence of events throws a quarter at us, where we have an unexpected drop or increase. We saw a very strong instrument business in the first quarter of this year, and while we weren't straight-lining that, we did anticipate that it would be stronger. And in fact, through most of this quarter, we had pretty robust results, and then at the very end of the quarter, it faded, much to our surprise. So I'm not -- as you can tell from our forecast, we don't anticipate that this is a forever dynamic. We are conservatizing our outlook in the second half to some extent. But we don't think that there are major share dynamics going on here, and we don't think this is forever. But we continue to dig deeper in this whole underlying demand phase of the LC instruments.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe as a follow-up, I mean, one of the things you've been dealing with, a lot of folks have been dealing with, their exporters, is kind of the strong dollar. It seems like that could be in play for some time and maybe even continue to move against you. I guess, in that context, for places like India, where we've seen disruptions, the rupee has gone up to kind of INR 60 or something like that or in other kind of emerging geographies, how are you thinking about that as it kind of progresses through the year, where people are kind of adjusting to kind of this new set level and so they're just assuming we're not going to see a correction like in times past, where they've maybe basically delayed spending for more favorable exchange rates instead of just going forward with it? How do you -- what are you sort of assuming for that dynamic in the back half?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, we're assuming that in Japan, we're going to continue to see a yen that's around about the current level, and I think that's a pretty fair estimate. But early -- the yen did weaken from the beginning of the year to this point, so we have seen incremental pain from the translation of the yen. We haven't seen a lot of underlying demand dynamics in Japan as a result of that. So contrary to what happens in India, where, clearly, the very weak rupee has affected the local conditions significantly. We haven't seen that in Japan, and Japan is largely a translation effect on our business. And I think the thing to remember is that while this costs us $0.30 relative to last year's earnings, if the yen stabilizes where it is now, then next year is a more normal period and we don't have that piece of page. So look, we operate in a world of many different currencies, the euro and the yen being the most significant. And we continue to believe that facing the dynamics through our operating plans, it's a slippery slope if you try to hedge these dynamics and then get into dramatic costs and forecasting issues, as you try to forecast well into the future. So historically, we feel like we have done a better job by addressing this through our operations. We'll continue to do that, and we'll have to work our way through it","Operator","Our next question does come from Dan Leonard of Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","First off, on your backlog communication, is it right to think that your current level of backlog is about twice what you would normally carry? Or is it some different multiple of that?","John A. Ornell","Yes, the increment year-to-date, Doug talked about a $20 million increment in the backlog through June, that's up about double what it traditionally would be. And that demand is heavily affecting growth in Asia, specifically, Asia and Japan, through the half. Much of this came in later in week 13 and just given logistics and revenue recognition in that part of the world, couldn't be converted. But that's the increment to the base backlog that we typically have that we're discussing.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So is it right, then, to think of your second half communication as you can get about a point from additional backlog burn and maybe 4 points from underlying demand on the top line?","John A. Ornell","That's exactly right. So the logic to the sales revenue growth in the second half of the year is a continuation of the order rate that would be closer to 4-ish percent. It's the base order rate, coupled with a reduction of backlog over both Q3 and Q4, that would add a point to that. So we're basically projecting that we'll see a continuation of the first half's order rate and then a backlog pull-down to add a point to that in each of the next couple of quarters.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then my follow-up question, on Japan, assuming a stable yen from here forward, does the absence of that $0.30 headwind in 2013, does that fall to the bottom line in 2014? Or are there offsets?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, when you say does it fall to the bottom line, it just means that you're -- you have a stable base of comparison, Dan. It doesn't...","John A. Ornell",".","It doesn't repeat itself is another way to think of it.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. So if the yen had been stable -- one way of looking at it is if the yen has been, on average, comparable to 2012 this year, our earnings would have been $0.30 higher. So if the yen stays stable, then we think with our -- all other things being equal, if we get where we call our normal growth and our normal attention to the bottom line, you'd see normal earnings growth dynamics from us in the future.","John A. Ornell","Exactly. So if the yen doesn't -- this year went from about JPY 80 to JPY 100. If it doesn't go from JPY 100 to JPY 120 next year, we don't repeat that $0.30 penalty.","Operator","Our next question does come from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You guys indicated LC weakness, I believe, was primarily in U.S. biopharma or developed economy biopharma for non-QA\/QC purposes. Just wondering if you could talk about how exactly you know these instruments are being used. I guess what I'm getting at is how confident are you that QA\/QC demand remains strong? And if the answer is because you see that -- if part of the answer is because you know what's going on also in mass spec and you know that mass spec is strong in these non-QA\/QC areas, like discovery, are you sure that LCs from other vendors aren't being attached to these mass specs? I think this gets it really also a question of how you're positioned share-wise in LC.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, Doug. I think we're pretty confident that our information systems and our reporting mechanisms tell us with pretty good accuracy what's happening in our order rate, where it's coming from. And it also tells us, with a fair degree of precision, whether what we're seeing is due to delayed orders or share loss. And as you know, share just doesn't change radically quarter-to-quarter, and we had very good results in the first quarter. Instrument demand was up 8%, I think, in the first quarter. I wouldn't say wow. Therefore, we took lots of market shares in the first quarter, and demand was down in the second quarter. Unfortunately, this isn't the first time in my career that we're seeing those kinds of swings, so unusual but it happened before. So there's nothing -- there's been no technological advancement, there's been no regulatory issue that's dramatically changed the playing field that we've seen. Yes, we saw one of our vendors incorporate their own LC a year or so ago, and we absolutely saw some dynamic there. That's played itself out. We don't see major shifts in who's putting LCs in front of their mass specs. So I just -- I think that this is more of a timing issue. And additional to the U.S. dynamic, we're clearly seeing a major center of LC demand in India become very challenged by the issue on the ground in India. So I think those 2 issues are clearly what's happening in our instrument demand. India, I think, is likely to continue this year, whereas the other dynamic, I think, is likely to be more of a short-term issue.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So let me ask, I guess, 1, maybe 2 follow-ups. On the timing issue, talking about this as though it's a timing issue. I mean, a lot of your business was strong here. It's clearly how instruments came in at the end of the quarter. I think from talking to you guys over the years, it's probably fair to assume that you get something like ballpark of $80 million in instrument revenue in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And given your miss was attributed primarily to instruments, it seems like that came in closer to something like $60 million to $65 million -- or $15 million to $20 million below target. You talked a lot about how great backlog is heading into Q2. Would you be willing to tell us how much of the Q2 miss you've recaptured in the early weeks of Q3? I think that is important for investors in assessing how much of this truly was a timing issue.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Sure, Doug. I think your -- our orders are more weighted to the last 2 weeks of the quarter than you estimate. So I think it should be very clear that while we saw very strong comparisons right through the quarter, right into the last part of the quarter, we weren't anticipating that to continue with the rate that it was. So we had, what we thought, some cushion and it still fell off to a degree that brought us to where we are now. As it relates to going forward, there's no question that we've captured some of those orders that we anticipated to get in the second quarter, as we've gone through the third quarter. I caution you, though, that the same thing happened a bit in the first quarter, where we -- there was many millions of dollars awarded that we thought we were going to get late in the first quarter that we absolutely captured in the first part of the second quarter. So that makes me more reluctant to automatically say I know what's happening here. We're satisfied that our stocks in the third quarter has been positive. And I think we've rolled in what we've learned from the second quarter, applied the management judgment that says, \"We don't want a repeat of what we saw in the second quarter.\" So I think the combination of all those factors suggests that we see nothing now that would lead us to believe we could have a repeat of the second quarter. But it's still a forecast, and we're still going to do our best to make sure we achieve it.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last quick one. In Q1, I think your chemistry growth was just under 1%. We don't know what the number was for Q2, but it's probably at least 7% to 8%. Is the right way to think about this from here is just really think about the first half growth and project it forward? Or are you -- it does sound like you might think it may be a little bit better than that.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think the second quarter is more reflective of what we believe the underlying growth. The first quarter was very unusual and impacted by some things like large chemistry orders that were in the base in Asia that didn't repeat in the second quarter. I think the mid to somewhat higher growth rate for chemistry is much more our feeling going forward.","Operator","Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If we look back, we have seen misses on the business before that were driven by late quarter spending dynamics. I think we all know that. However, if you do look back, you guys have missed -- revenue were put in line -- put up in line reports for something like 6 quarters in a row now. So I appreciate that the operating environment is challenging, but can you give us a little confidence as to why you have good visibility or line of sight on the back half assumptions you're making here and the fact that your guidance is conservative?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, Doug -- Isaac, excuse me, I think that our visibility hasn't changed very much. As you know, we, like most everybody in this business, don't operate with very significant backlogs. So most quarters, we have to generate, in that quarter, the business that we're going to ship and record as revenue. So we have all the tools that we've always had, which is discussions with our customers, historical run rates, projection of the strength of the economic environment, and we have a reasonably sophisticated process. But as we've seen, it's forecasts, and there are a lot of pieces of that, that move around in an individual quarter. We clearly thought and thought through most of this quarter that we had properly anticipated what was going to happen, and then, in very short order, it fell out of bed. We've looked at that, we've examined the underlying trends. Much like the first quarter, we saw this weakness in chemistry, and we didn't believe it. And in fact, that all turned around in the second quarter, and we're reasonably confident that, that's going to continue in the second half. We had a very strong first quarter in instruments, and then it dropped in the second quarter. We don't think that, that was anything we did. We don't think that, as I said, dramatic market share changes occurred. It's frustrating, I know it is for you, and it certainly is for us. But we continue to try to refine what we know, and we overlay what our product introductions are and what the customers are telling us, what the field is telling us. We try to apply a little degree of conservatism there. And -- but I can't tell you that our process has changed as a result of this. We just looked harder, looked harder at the backlog, looked harder at the customer forecast, and we continue to try to do our best. But we live in a world of uncertainty.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, I totally understand that part, for sure. One follow-up would be a little bit more on the items that you guys can control, one specifically on just use of cash. I mean, in the past, you've had years where you have purchased stock in excess of the free cash flow you generated. Just given the long-term growth drivers of the business and where you are right now, why not buy back more stock? And then just secondly, if you could touch a little bit on the plan here for mass spec. What do you guys have in the pipeline that you can talk to in terms of new project -- products? And maybe are those defensive products that are going to help the gross margin or the operating margin story?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, on the mass spec front, I think, as I alluded to, we have some, I think, exciting near-term plans that, unfortunately, I don't think I could talk to much more about. But you'll see that happening in the second half, really in the fourth quarter. That should have a significant impact next year, maybe a marginal impact in the fourth quarter. But I think the run rate in mass spec, the competitive positions, that's all encouraging. I think we're -- coming out of the last couple of years, we had to scramble a little bit more to secure our position in mass spec. Current indications are that, that's going well. The second part of that?","John A. Ornell","Share repurchases.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes. We continue to believe that our stock's a good investment. John has shared what the authorization is. I can tell you that, at the board level, we continue to wonder whether we're aggressive enough. So that clearly is the way we lean, and I think that's the way we'll continue to lean about applying more of our cash flow to share buyback rather than less. I guess that's probably the most I want to say about that.","Operator","Our next question does come from Amit Bhalla of Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Doug, TA Instruments has been a consistent positive performer for quite some time. I'm wondering if you could just talk about what the weakness there tells you about the industrial and chemical end markets.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, Amit, it's very unusual -- you're absolutely right. TA has been a consistent performer through many years, and again, I think we've had somewhat of a perfect storm here that is not likely to continue. TA had a combination of slow results in the biocalorimetry piece of their business. It's the first time, I think, in many quarters that we've seen that. And as they have gone back and looked at that, we see no reason to believe that, that's a continuing dynamic. They also had a backlog build that affected their results, and that's been reflected in improvements that we see in the second half. I think they have a very strong market position, a very strong technological base. And I think you'll see TA return to more traditional growth rates as we get through the second half of this year.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You don't think that there's an underlying end market issue here taking place?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Not versus our level of expectations. I mean, I think we're expecting mid-single digit kind of performance. That's somewhat lower than we've seen traditionally, and yes, I do think that, that's kind of market related. But off that base, I don't expect dramatic changes.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And Doug, just a follow-up on the academic, government comments you made, can you talk to -- talk about those in the context of any incremental changes sequentially or just put into better context what's going on in that end market?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I think the European markets were pretty strong in that segment of our business. And we also saw an uptick, although it wasn't all shippable in the Japanese marketplace as they kicked in with some stimulus spending. The place where we saw disappointing results and clearly, some impact from the sequester was in the U.S. And so some of that business, we expect to actually return in the second half, but we haven't been overly ebullient in what we're expecting out of government sources in the U.S. in the second half. I think it's going to continue to be a tough area until the whole government spending in the U.S. gets somewhat more straightened out.","Operator","Our next question does come from Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask first a question on India. Certainly, I know into the quarter, there's optimism that you guys were to recovery. Just wanted to kind of flesh out a little bit the results that you saw, kind of the rupee versus some of the other operational issues that you've been seeing in India and kind of what's implied in your guidance for the back half of the year there.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, India has been frustrating because now it's almost about a year of continuing weakness in the rupee that continues to put pressure on almost all of these accounts of getting the capital to invest. And boy, if you looked at the discussions that we're having with those accounts and how much they want to buy, you'd say it's going to be strong double-digit growth as far as the eye can see. So the customer expectations and desires are certainly there, but they've been unable to fulfill that and get the capital to invest. Now in the second quarter, that's coupled with the fact that we had a reasonably strong second quarter in India last year and so that makes the comparison tougher. We have easier comparisons as we go through the second half, but that's kind of not a statement on the return to growth of the India market. We were anticipating it'll continue to be tough in the second half, and I see no signs that they've really had a fundamental ability to overcome the fact that the rupee has weakened by some 20-plus percent in the last year or so. So I think it's going to continue to be a struggle.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just shifting gears over to the kind of chromatography weakness in the quarter. Can you -- Doug, I think you were citing sometimes things are somewhat unexplainable with this weakness that you saw in discovery chromatography. But is there another quarter, possibly, you could point to in the past when you saw that type of weakness in chromatography and discovery work? Anything to get our -- help get our arms around this event and how we should evaluate this quarter's weakness and an expected pickup as we move forward.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, we have seen -- but it's not -- some of it is formfitting. You go through a quarter like this where you have weak demand in discovery, and you'd say what are the dynamics that we think affected it. In the past, we've seen mergers in big pharma that can dramatically affect the demand swings from a quarter to a quarter. So we've seen that, over the past 10 years, 2 or 3x, where demand sucked as they were absorbing mergers and acquisitions. I'd say, we -- it's unusual to see it in a period like this, where there's relative stability in the big pharma marketplace. So I can't point to a specific point in the past, where things have done like this. And it's a little surprising to see the strength in mass spec and to see weakness in the chromatography. But as I say, it's telling that we saw strength in the chromatography market, greater strength in the first quarter, and so you look at the average across that, you're looking at low-single digit first half growth. That's probably more telling and more indicative of what the market is doing than any one quarter standing on its own. So that's what we think, and that's what we're planning for.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then maybe I can sneak just one more in. Just back to an earlier question, Doug, it's just kind of on your attach rate. Could you discuss kind of how it's been trending, say, over the past kind of a year plus or so and kind of what you expect going forward? I think you commented that there's no issue with the attach rate. Just wondering if you could put a little bit more detail.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, I would say -- I wouldn't say the attach rate in terms of our consumables business is getting higher. I'd say it continues to be very good. And ACQUITY is a big piece of that, where the use of our consumables with our ACQUITY instruments from the day of introduction was high and continues to be very high. I would say we see no falloff, but then we don't see a greater attach rate. But it's high and we continue to be satisfied with it.","Operator","Jon Groberg of Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Doug, just I think you mentioned this before. But in the first quarter, you also mentioned pharma kind of delays. And as you alluded to on this call, that's why you're not getting too far ahead of yourselves because you saw it again on the second quarter. So I'm just curious, is this just 1 or 2 customers that this happens to each quarter. Has it been broad-based, these delays? Do you think this is just kind of the new norm?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, it's certainly not universal, Jon. It's -- we see strength in some large pharma accounts and weakness in others. And some of it's quarter-to-quarter, where one that was weak in the first quarter is strong in the second quarter. Some of that's project related. We continue to believe that, long term, this is a good set of customers, that the demands on them and the demands in early stage continue to be high. And we continue to believe that we're introducing capabilities across our platforms in chemistry and in instruments and in data and information processing that will produce gains for us. It's certainly been frustrating that, that's been as choppy as it has been. And you see individual cases where you can understand that somebody -- some pharmaceutical in China gets challenged because of regulatory issues and you see orders flow there, but those are one-offs. There's not one layer of dynamic that's affecting everybody in this industry.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So is it kind of fair to say, last quarter, it was a certain set of customers; this quarter, it's a different set of customers? And I'm just curious, for the second half outlook that you described, would you say that now you're kind of taking into account that, that's likely to happen at the end of each of the next couple of quarters as well.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, we think so. We -- as I say, we don't think that the first quarter instrument growth rate in the high-single digits was run-ratable. We don't think that the rate in the second quarter. We think the average of that is more likely what we're going to see in the second half, and that's what we've planned for.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","And just to hop on instruments, I think, it has MS. It actually sounded like demand for instruments was pretty stable, kind of what you're describing now. So for like the first half of the year, if you exclude revenue, but if you just talked about orders, can you maybe talk about mass spec versus LC for the first half of the year in terms of orders, kind of what that looks like?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I mean, as we said, the instrument order rate is mid-single digits.","John A. Ornell","Mass spec, a little faster.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","And mass spec is a little higher, and LC is a little lower.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, if I can, to just finish my question, but then just -- John, can you maybe, just really quickly -- it sounds like, for the year, you're still talking about mid-single digit growth, which is, what, last quarter, what you guys talked about for the full year. I kind of go down through the P&L of some of the ships that you made. Can you maybe just highlight what are the key reasons for the lowered kind of EPS guidance, given the -- it looks like a similar mid-single digit top line?","John A. Ornell","For the second half, I think, basically, what we're saying, the guidance on the EPS is down largely as a result of the miss in the second quarter. And then, on the second half of the year, there's just a modest decline in earnings associated with a slightly worse yen than what we had before. Share count is up a little bit versus where we thought we might be as a result of the higher share price, and there's other little bits of movement between expenses and a slightly lower tax rate. But it's all kind of rounding, if you will, Jon. So it's -- the dropoff in EPS of $0.15 versus the midpoint guide to guide is largely a Q2 miss with the second half largely intact.","Operator","Our next question does come from Amanda Murphy of William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I actually had a follow-up to Doug's earlier question on the chromatography sales. So obviously, the sales are a bit weaker on the pharma side but -- or early stage side. I'm curious, can you help us think about -- or even qualitatively, think about the contribution from sales to the regulated markets? Just assuming that's a contributor to growth in some ways, I'm just trying to figure out how much that is and how to think about that over the rest of the year.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Amanda, when you talk about the regulated markets, are you talking about just pharma in general, pharma QC or...","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess I was thinking about pharma QA\/QC, but maybe you can talk to it more broadly as well.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, pharma QA\/QC was right on our expectations. So as I said, it was really the R&D and tending towards the discovery segment of pharma that was off our expectations. The regulated market, I think, continues to be pretty predictable. That's where the workhorse instruments go. It's where productivity -- it's much like a manufacturing process of writing those analyses. So I would say the demand there tends to be more predictable, more consistent. And historically, I think the other stages of pharmaceutical capital spending tends to be lumpier and less predictable.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So in terms of QA\/QC adoption of the H-Class, for example, I mean, is that something that could accelerate or be a larger contribution -- or contributor on the back half? Or do you expect that to be sort of...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I think, over time, we believe that H-Class will continue to penetrate more and more QC. Our penetration has been good, but it certainly is not universal. But I wouldn't suggest that you see significant dynamics in a quarter-to-quarter basis. This is a multiyear dynamic that I suggest you see not quarter-to-quarter.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just a similar question on the mass spec side and maybe this is a moot question just given your comments on some of the potential launches you might have coming up here. But -- so you've obviously had some pretty good results there in the higher end side of it with SYNAPT and Xevo. I mean, how do you think about that in terms of how much more runway you have given some of the improvements in the product line that you've introduced recently? Is that something that can -- that growth rate can sustain for multi-quarters? Or is that something that you should see this year and then maybe tapers off next year?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm pretty encouraged by the opportunities in the high end. And I think our introductions and our current interactions with customers in metabonomics and proteomics are -- I think are served markets that are showing very good results. The opportunities in the applied markets, particularly in food safety, continue to grow and provide, I think, a very secure long-term source of mass spec revenues. An encouraging current dynamic is in the clinical market. We've served the clinical market in places like the neonatal and any rejection growth analyses market and pain monitoring areas. Those are well-developed segments of the clinical marketplace. Some of you may have seen recent results, particularly coming out of Britain, on emerging areas that we're participating heavily in and have very good visibility. I think that's longer term. That's not going to affect the second half of this year. But there were very good signs of emerging applications for mass spec and high value-added mass spec that we're developing in the clinical marketplace. So I think that's very encouraging. And I think we're working on some of the areas of bringing mass spec to the underserved areas on the benchtop. So that we hope to have some more information on as we go through 2013.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just last quick one on Japan. Have you looked at the stimulus dollars and sort of figured out how much of that might be available to Waters specifically?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, we looked at the particular tenders that have been let under that. Of course, not all tenders have been let under the expectation. And the stimulus approvals in Japan came later than originally anticipated. So we absolutely have booked several orders late in the quarter under the stimulus plan. And we're anticipating that the net result of that, with our ongoing business in Japan, we'll see an improvement in our growth rate in the second half of this year.","Operator","Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Doug, how confident are you in being able to get back to a long-term top line organic growth rate of something like the 7% that you guys usually want to see?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","It's still our target. We still believe that the markets we serve and that the technologies that we bring, combined with the geographical dynamics and the improvements in the developing markets -- I do understand that any time you have a period when it's been a challenge to meet those rates, raises questions about whether you have to reconsider what those long-term growth rates are. But I think we've been in a relatively unusual period, lots of challenges. Typically, coming out of these periods is where you see some of your best growth, and I still believe that we're capable of producing those growth rates. We're not so large to be challenged inordinately by kind of the lot of large numbers. And so yes, I still believe that the combination of our technologies can get us to that mid- to high-single digit growth rate.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I mean, I guess, when you think about the end markets, when you guys have kind of achieved those levels of growth in the past you've had government, academic funding that was growing pretty rapidly every year and you had pharmaceutical R&D spending that was growing pretty rapidly every year. And those 2 dynamics, for sure, have seemingly changed for the -- at least the intermediate term.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, certainly, big pharma has changed. But we're coming into -- coming off a period where startup biotech funding has been pretty robust, and we're coming off a period where biotech spending was pretty slow. So we see near-term opportunities in some of that smaller to intermediate-sized biotech spending to be very encouraging. So look, I think it's fair questions, but in my experience, it's -- people tend to look at -- if they're at the bottom of the well, they tend to forecast that they're always going to be there. And when times are rosy and robust, the tendency is to forecast that those conditions will continue. Generally, it's just the opposite. Generally, what happens is that when industry conditions are weak, they tend to get better. Obviously, that's in my best interest, but I think that traditionally has been what's happened. I think it would be wrong to think that, all of a sudden, the technologies that we provide are becoming less valued in the world.","Operator","Our next question does come from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So in the interest of time, I'll keep it short. So did -- in the pharma discovery, when you're talking about LC delays, was this delays of new LC systems for purchases or were these replacements? Do you have any clarity on that? And I guess Europe was strong in the quarter. Could you compare and contrast the European pharma versus the U.S. pharma? I think people are trying to figure out the dynamics that was going on in discovery areas there, if there's anything that's markedly going on that is different.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Derik, there's no difference between European pharma and U.S. pharma. I mean, in terms of the -- these are multinational companies. And really, it would be wrong to think that Glaxo and AstraZeneca are riding high and Pfizer and Lilly are riding low. That could be happening, but they're related to individual corporate dynamics, not related to geographical applications. And so while it's true that we score our business in a particular way that says this business was generated in Europe and it came out of a pharma company, but I think it's more to think about the pharma industry in global terms and the fact that global spending in our front end was weak. So I think it's that piece that suggests that in the tradeoff of separations versus detection in the mass spec, the air is on the side of the higher end mass spectrometry purchases this quarter. But I think, as I've said and I continue to say, there's a leveling off. Those tend to be 1 quarter dynamics that don't indicate a permanent change.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. One quick follow-up. You mentioned environmental last quarter being a little bit soft. Did environmental improve this quarter?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Environmental was okay. I'd say in the non-pharma markets, the food safety and food analysis is probably the strongest area of our non-pharma business.","Operator","Our next question does come from Dan Arias of UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe just one for me. Doug, going back to pharma. When you think about your view there and what you're seeing out of those accounts, does the growth outlook at this point include anything in the way of expectations for a budget flush in 4Q? I guess to the extent that you have a feel, what's the general thinking in terms of end-of-the-year spending there?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I would say we always -- in our run rates, we always see some end-of-the-year uptick or fourth quarter dynamic. It's become, I'd say, less and less. Certainly, in my time in the industry, if you went back 10, 15 years, there was a much bigger end-of-the-year dynamics than there is currently. So we don't expect an inordinate end-of-the-year dynamic in those terms. We expect a more normalized pattern of demand.","Operator","Our next question does come from Tycho Peterson of JPMC.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Question on the OpEx. If we look at the original guidance you provided for the year, it was 3% to 4% OpEx growth. Obviously, that was off the 5% expectations originally for the year on the top line. Now you're talking about 2%. Can you just talk about -- to the extent that you've got levers to pull here, are these project delays? Is it just less travel? Can you talk about where the OpEx leverage is coming from?","John A. Ornell","Yes, it's slightly more effect as a result of currency, but mostly it's associated with holding back on discretionary spend at the levels that we're likely to end at now. There'll be slightly less variable pay schemes being paid out. There'll be -- the project expense associated with getting new products out and making those investments is largely intact. But we are looking to, everywhere we can, hold back on spend to compensate for the yen and the somewhat softer order rate as we make our way through the second half.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","So it largely comes out of everything we've described as discretionary spend, Tycho. I mean, it's travel, it's meetings, it's -- you can't do it forever, but you can continue to limit that. And you put on extra controls, and you make life as miserable as possible to have somebody spend incremental money. And it's a tough time, and I think everybody appreciates that they have got to tighten their belts a little more. We're not embarking on any significant structural reductions. Again, it's important to recognize that $0.30 a share of our pain this year is coming out of the yen. And we do think that, that has a fixed lifetime, that we'll come out of this, and we don't want to do things that causes us long-term pain. But in the short term, if everybody takes their belts down a notch, we can help keep our expenses lower.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then a quick follow-up, can you just comment on general pricing trends in the market today? And then also, can you clarify what your expectations are on academic in the back of the year? I think I heard you say that you thought it could get a little bit better. I just want you to clarify that.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, I'll take the general pricing trends, and John can talk about academics. But general -- in any period of time, a quarter or 6 months, we'll see 1 territory in the world kind of pop up with the sales force complaining that so and so has given away their products and it's much tougher to sell because, god, the discounts are ranging high. You almost always get some territory that's complaining about that. If you look at our average end market pricing across instruments, mass spec and chemistry, we have seen no significant change in that. Our margin, to the extent that you can see, a slight change in margin. It comes from mix and the fact that our mass spec margins are a little bit lower than our instrument margins, but it doesn't relate to a change period-to-period in the pricing. Pricing has been solidly constant.","John A. Ornell","And on the government, academic expectation, we started the year with a high-single digit growth in government and academic. We came into the second quarter, it flattened out there. So the expectation and the guide in the third and fourth quarter is that we'll see a couple percent growth worldwide for that market.","Operator","Our next question does come from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Security.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Just to dig down deeper, on the customers, what were they actually saying around those delayed orders?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","I'm sorry, Peter, what -- I didn't catch all of that. What are the customers saying about the delayed orders?","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes, exactly.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Well, in terms of some specific orders, we've actually seen them close in the third quarter. So that gives us some confidence that our people on the ground were right, in that a number of those orders were in the works and for either capital spending reasons or just administrative delays, they flipped from the second quarter into the third quarter. When you look at the pharma dynamic in early stage, our customers -- again, you don't get them to talk specifically about a delayed order necessarily there. It's -- they're not saying anything different about their commitment to early-stage discovery. It's not like a big pharmaceutical company is now saying that they're out of the early-stage discovery business. So you probe around it as to what their capital budgets are, what their plans are, and that's the same story. We don't believe that there are significant changes, and that's another reason why we think that this is just kind of quarterly abnormality, that we're more likely to see a more average period of demand than we are -- either the spike in the first quarter or the downward turn in the second quarter.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then the disconnect you're seeing in LC versus mass spec for pharma discovery, could that be anything internal versus being an external issue?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Internal, by -- you mean, like a company specifically?","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes, sales organization issue or...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","No, we don't think so. We don't think it's the fact that the sales force is happier with mass spectrometry. We have pretty good mechanisms to -- both in the compensation arena, as well as in the field force management. We don't think this is internally driven. We think that this is just the vagaries of demand across a big wide, worldwide marketplace.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And how much of it -- FX impact, how has that changed since 1Q? I guess I'm trying to work out how much of the...","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Kind of little bit worse, probably $0.05 worth in the second half.","John A. Ornell","Yes, we ended up having the yen, as you might recall, lifting up meaningfully across the quarter, coming kind of back down to where we thought it would be. But the average was like a couple percent higher across the quarter. Other currencies were under a little bit of pressure versus original guy. But really, the yen, at the end of the day, is the biggest contributor, and you're looking at, as Doug said, about $0.05 across the year associated with incremental FX.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And that's versus 1Q and now?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","That's versus -- right, the guide we gave in April for the 1Q results.","Operator","Our last question does come from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","My question is just a follow-up on one of your answers to Tycho's question regarding operating expenses. And I was just wondering, now that you've had to lower the EPS guidance again, as it relates to your variable compensation, how much of a reduction in variable comp is there? I think, if I remember correctly, maybe last year, there was a pretty large cost of variable comp last year that helped earnings a little bit. I was just wondering how much variable comp has come now -- come down now in your new guidance.","John A. Ornell","Yes, that -- there's still some base amount of variable comp that's in there for various geographies and various groups, so they are likely to still achieve some base level of hedge. There's other measures, EPS and others, that are now likely not to have a payout. So a significant portion of the decline is associated with expectations that plans won't be met and we'll see a reduction in the variable pay that leads to a meaningful piece of that reduction overall.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Just to flesh out, the meaningful -- our variable pay plan for the senior people, as I talked about the 25 senior people in the company, are all driven off earnings per share growth, and the payouts don't get meaningful until you get to double-digit earnings per share growth. So in a period like this where there is minimal, if any, earnings per share growth, there is no variable comp that is paid out. So we go into the year, of course, planning to have a successful year, and if it turns out like this year, then there will be no variable payout of any significant amount to the senior-most players in the company.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","I think that goes to the heart of my question. Just were you accruing for senior management incentive compensation and now because of the guidance reduction, you reversed that or you've stopped accruing for that?","Douglas A. Berthiaume","There is a piece of that. We -- coming out of the first quarter, we anticipated that there would be some payout, now we're not.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Is there any way to quantify that change?","John A. Ornell","It's a few million dollars.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Yes, it's in the low millions of dollars.","John A. Ornell","Right. We were accruing, Steve, at the lowest payout levels in the first place. Otherwise, it would have been a more meaningful amount.","Douglas A. Berthiaume","Okay. I appreciate everybody staying on well past our normal stop date -- stop time. Hopefully, that helped you in putting in, in perspective coming off a difficult quarter. I do want to emphasize that we have seen times like this in the past. We're disappointed that we had a soft quarter. We do think that we're well positioned for the future, and we do think that the second half is likely to be a better performance than we saw this quarter. So hopefully, you'll all be back to hear about that the next time we get together, and we hope to hear from you again. Thanks for taking the time, and we'll talk to you again.","Operator","Today's conference has ended.

Please go ahead, sir.","Bryan Brokmeier","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language.","During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company for the fourth quarter and full year 2019.","We caution you that all such statements are only our present expectations that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risks factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, in Part 1 under the caption, Risk Factors, and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s press release and 8-K.","We further caution you that the company does not intent to update its -- any of its predictions or projections, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for February 04, 2020.","During today\u2019s call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and available on the company\u2019s website.","In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning\u2019s press release.","Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today\u2019s call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chris O\u2019Connell, Waters\u2019 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Chris?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning\u2019s call is Sherry Buck, Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer. ","During today\u2019s call, I will provide an overview of our third quarter operating results, as well as some broader commentary on our business. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. ","Briefly reviewing our operating results for the third quarter, revenue grew 1%, while adjusted earnings per share grew 11%. With one meaningful exception, the third quarter played out largely as we expected. That exception was the U.S. where we saw unanticipated late quarter softness, which led to a shortfall against our overall revenue expectations for Q3. ","At the time of our last earnings call, the strength of our U.S. performance in Q2 as well as the growth we saw during the first month of Q3 reinforced our prior expectation that we would see positive second half trends in the U.S. market. However, that momentum yielded to a more cautious tone from our U.S. pharmaceutical customers as the quarter developed, resulting in inconsistent capital purchasing in the second half of the quarter.","Outside of the U.S. Q3 played out largely as we expected, with a continuation of mixed market conditions in China and Europe that we\u2019ve seen throughout the year. ","Stepping back to look at 2019 through the first three quarters, it is clear, the challenges in the global macroeconomic environment, including market effects of government policy changes in China, lingering European political uncertainties, and mixed sentiment in the U.S. have led to a more variable set of end market conditions than we expected coming into the year. ","Customers in key markets we serve have simply been more cautious in their capital purchasing during 2019 and more willing to delay spending quarter-to-quarter. One particular market impacted by these global macroeconomic challenges during 2019 has been small molecule pharmaceutical LC applications. This market where Waters has unique focus appears to be in a slower growth environment with ongoing stability and recurring revenue while simultaneously seeing modest pressure in instrument systems sales. ","Certainly recent trends in India and China play a central role in this dynamic as does U.S. and European volatility in recent quarters. ","That said, we are confident in our leading technology portfolio and strong market position as well as the long-term growth prospects of the small molecule LC market. ","Aside from the macro environment, Waters has been diligently focused in 2019 on an exciting series of new product introductions that is positioning the company for a robust multiyear product cycle. While the impact of these new products has not been highly visible on the revenue line yet, market development activities are progressing well. And we are very pleased with early customer reactions. ","BioAccord made solid incremental progress in Q3 relative to demo, quoting and sales pipelines. And the third quarter launches of the Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS and our two new tandem quad mass spectrometers have all been very well received. We expect to see an increasing sales contribution from all of these key products in Q4 2020 and beyond. ","We remain very positive on the long-term attractiveness and durability of the markets we serve. In particular, our recurring revenue, consisting of precision chemistries in servicing of our instruments has remained steady, indicating consistent underlying utilization of our strong installed base of instruments. ","Taking a closer look at the business starting with a review of our market categories at the corporate level, sales to our broadly defined pharmaceutical category increased 3% for the quarter and year-to-date, with strong growth in China and India, partially offset by weakness in the U.S. and Europe. As I stated earlier, the global market for small molecule pharmaceutical applications is currently experiencing a more modest growth environment. ","Conversely, the global large molecule market remained robust in Q3 and year-to-date. And we have sustained consistently positive results supported by our focused investments in this category, across LC, LC-MS and chemistries. ","Sales to our worldwide industrial category, which includes the material science, food and environmental markets, were flat in the quarter with strength in material science offset by global weakness in food testing markets. ","Furthermore, our industrial category remained solid in the U.S., but soft in Europe. Year-to-date, our worldwide industrial category sales were down 2%. ","Sales to our academic and governmental category were down 3% in Q3 as strong growth in European biomedical research and materials research applications is offset by weakness in the Americas and China markets, most notably the China food segment. Year-to-date, our academic and governmental category was flat as growth in Europe and the U.S. has been offset by declines in China. ","Next, I will review our sales performance by geography at the corporate level. Asia, our largest region in terms of revenue grew 7% in the third quarter. China grew 2%, which as I noted earlier, was driven by strong pharmaceutical growth, partially offset by food market weakness, and has been further influenced by the broader economic slowdown in China. ","Looking specifically at the China pharmaceutical market, generic customers were cautious at the beginning of the year, while they digested the impact of the 4+7 program. However, this caution has given a way to a return of capital investment. Bidding in the second phase of the 4+7 program occurred in September and we\u2019re closely following the subsequent developments. ","We continue to be encouraged by the pragmatic tone of our customers through this process, as well as the program\u2019s increasingly stringent quality requirements, which together support our initial observations that the larger pharma companies with higher market shares will be the most likely to benefit from 4+7. ","Furthermore, we\u2019re well positioned in this regard, because within the Chinese generic pharmaceutical market, we have a higher concentration of sales to these larger companies than we do to smaller companies. ","As mentioned last quarter, we believe that 4+7 will result in rising generic prescription volume in China over time, creating a positive tailwind for instrument demand. In India, solid growth was driven by the continued strength in the pharmaceutical market partially offset by industrial softness. Elsewhere in Asia, we continue to be pleased with our business in Japan and Korea, where we expect ongoing stability. ","Turning to the U.S., we are disappointed with the 4% decline in the third quarter. U.S. pharma reversed the improving trend we saw in Q2 as our largest pharmaceutical customers, as well as generics companies slowed spending across both LC and LC-MS instruments during the second half of the third quarter. ","On the other hand Q3 sales to our U.S. industrial customers grew 5% year-over-year. Overall, the Americas declined 5% in the third quarter, including expected weakness in Latin America, due to the ongoing political instability in both Mexico and Brazil. ","Year-to-date, the U.S. grew 2% slightly ahead of 2018\u2019s Q3 year-to-date results, while total Americas in 2019 year-to-date have been flat, influenced by weakness we\u2019ve seen in Latin America throughout the year as well. ","In Europe, sales were flat in the quarter with a nice rebound in Eastern Europe that we expected offsetting a slight decline in Western Europe. Overall European results continue to be impacted by cautious Big Pharma capital spending as well as weakness in food and environmental markets. ","Finally, I will review product line dynamics within our Waters and TA brands. Waters branded instrument sales declined 5% in the quarter. LC instruments declined slightly, and system with broader market LC trends that we spoke about earlier in our commentary. In LC-MS, our Q3 business was impacted by the weak Chinese food market as this market has a high concentration of our tandem quad LC-MS systems.","Outside of the China food market, our tandem quad portfolio performed well in biopharma R&D, followed -- following the early third quarter launch of our Xevo TQ-S cronos and the next generation version of the popular Xevo TQ-S micro. We are also off to a good start with the launch of our Cyclic IMS and SYNAPT XS systems. ","Commercialization of our BioAccord system continues to track positively as market development activities support a meaningful multiyear revenue ramp. Overall in LC-MS systems we are excited about our investments over the past several years in new instruments, chemistries and informatics targeting high growth applications, such as biopharma and we believe that we are now poised for improving results driven by our enhanced and extended portfolio. ","Waters branded recurring revenues which reflect the combination of service and precision chemistries grew 5% in the quarter. Chemistry strength in our pharmaceutical business was partially offset by softness in our industrial and academic and governmental categories. In particular, growth is strong and consistent within our application kits, UPLC columns and bioseparation columns. And we are seeing good uptick of our focused branded HPLC columns. ","Turning to our TA product line, sales grew 5% in the third quarter with TA instrument system sales up 7% and service sales up 1%. We are encouraged by solid ongoing growth in our thermal and microcalorimetry product lines. I am proud of our TA team which has maintained great focus through a period of leadership transition. Our new President of TA, Jon Pratt, has brought great new energy and leadership that will enable TA to build on its historic success to make even more significant contributions to Waters over time. ","Returning to the big picture, we remain steadfastly focused on executing on our five point value creation model. As we have consistently communicated, we aim to create shareholder value by: One, holding a leading specialty position in structurally attractive markets; two, executing a focused growth strategy driven by organic innovation; three, seeking opportunities for continuous operational improvement in innovation, channel and operations; four, maintaining capital discipline as we have shifted from being a capital accumulator to a capital deployer; and five, operating with a performance-oriented culture and management team. ","To recap the third quarter, our assumptions in China and Europe played out as we expected, while we experienced volatility in the U.S., particularly among our largest pharma customers. While the macro environment in 2019 has been more challenging than we expected, our concerted investment in new product development is yielding a strong cadence of new products that should increasingly contribute to results over the coming quarters and years. ","Looking to the fourth quarter, while we continue to focus on improving our sales growth and are prepared to fulfill higher demand, we are modeling our fourth quarter consistent with year-to-date trends. Sherry will cover the details of our guidance during her remarks. ","With that, I\u2019d like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of the third quarter financials and our outlook. Sherry? ","Sherry Buck","Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we recorded net sales of $577 million, an increase of approximately 1% in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 1% resulting in flat sales as reported. In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical market grew 3%, sales into our industrial market were flat, while academic and governmental markets declined 3%.","Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, grew 5% in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 3%. As we noted last quarter, there was no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the third quarter but there is one additional calendar day in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 2018.","Breaking third quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services were flat, while sales of TA branded products and services grew 5%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument platform sales were down 5% and TA\u2019s instrumentation system sales were up 7%. ","Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter geographically and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were up 7% with China growing at 2%, sales in Americas were down 5% with U.S. down 4% and European sales were flat. ","Now, I\u2019d like to comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.2%, about flat compared to 58.3% in the third quarter of 2018. ","Moving down the third quarter P&L, operating expenses were about flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis and benefited from lower variable expenses as compared to the prior year. In addition, foreign currency translation decreased operating expense growth by approximately 2% on a reported basis. ","In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was about 16%. Year-to-date, the tax rate is approximately 15%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net interest expense was $8 million, an increase of about $6 million from the prior year as anticipated, as we shifted to a net debt position over the course of the year. Our average share count came in at 66.8 million shares, a share count reduction of approximately 13%, or about 10 million shares lower than in the third quarter of last year. This is a net effect of our ongoing share repurchase program. ","Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter increased to $2.13 in comparison to $1.92 last year, an increase of about 11% driven by our ongoing share repurchase program, and lower variable expenses as compared to the prior year. ","On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.07 compared to $1.83 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. ","Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I\u2019d like to summarize our third quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the third quarter of 2019, free cash flow came in at $124 million after funding $24 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $21 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the third quarter, this resulted in $0.22 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow and $0.25 year-to-date. ","Now, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our third quarter activities related to capital deployment, which we\u2019ve categorized into three areas: Investing for growth; balance sheet strength and flexibility; and return of capital to shareholders. ","In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $580 million in the third quarter. These capital allocation activities along with our free cash flow resulted in cash and short-term investments of $405 million and debt of $1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter resulting in a net debt position of $951 million. Looking ahead, we remain committed to deploying capital against these three priorities. ","Our current plans are to repurchase approximately $600 million in shares during the fourth quarter and consistent with our previous communications, about $2.5 billion for the full year. These assumptions are reflected in our full year 2019 guidance. ","Turning to working capital, accounts receivable, day sales outstanding came in at 80 days this quarter, up slightly compared to the third quarter of last year. In the quarter, inventories increased by $55 million in comparison to the prior quarter, driven by planned inventory build related to Brexit contingency planning, and new product launches. Lower quarterly sales volumes also impacted inventory balances.","As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I\u2019d like to provide some broader context on our Q4 and full year 2019 guidance. Given dynamics through the first three quarters of the year, we\u2019re expecting ongoing mixed end market conditions in China and Europe, improvement in the U.S. versus Q3, and increasing benefits from new product launches. ","Our guide does not assume large end of year budget spending by pharmaceutical customers. As a result, we expect constant currency sales growth in the fourth quarter to be in the range of flat to 2%. At today\u2019s rates, currency translation is expected to decrease fourth quarter sales growth by about 1 percentage point. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share is estimated to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.05. At current rates, a negative currency impact on fourth quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be 2 to 3 percentage points. ","Looking to the full year, assuming we perform within the guidance range for the fourth quarter, that would result in full year 2019 constant currency sales growth guidance of about 1% compared to our prior guidance range of 1% to 3%. At current rates, currency translation is assumed to decrease 2019 sales growth by 1 to 2 percentage points. ","Gross margin guidance for the full year is now expected to be about 58.5% at the lower end of a prior guidance range of 58.5% to 59% due to less fixed cost absorption on the lower forecasted sales volumes. We will continue to exercise disciplined expense control for the balance of the year. ","Our other key assumptions for full year guidance are unchanged. Net interest expense of $30 million to $32 million, full year effective tax rate of 14% to 15%; and lastly, an average diluted share count of 68.5 million to 69 million shares outstanding. ","Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2019 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $8.73 to $8.83, a decrease from our prior range of $8.95 to $9.10. At current rates the negative currency impacts on full year earnings per share growth is expected to be 2 to 3 percentage points.","Chris will now make a few summary comments. Chris?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Thank you, Sherry. In summary, our third quarter saw continuation of market conditions influenced by a challenged global macroeconomic environment. We remain very positive on the ongoing durability and potential of our chosen market categories and we are excited about our increasing new product cadence for which our management team is focused on successful launch execution. ","With that, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not always able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Waters Investor Relations team after the call. Operator? ","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Doug Schenkel, Cowen. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. So Chris, over the last five years, Waters\u2019 division recurring revenue has gone from over 8% in 2015 to now tracking to 5% or below this year. In the time we\u2019ve been tracking Waters, which goes back to the early 2000s, we can\u2019t find anything that resembles this trend. And I can\u2019t find an annual recurring revenue growth number for the division as well as the one year tracking to this year other than in 2009. I think we can all understand why there might be periods where capital demand slows. But at the core of an investment in Waters, there\u2019s always been a belief that recurring revenue growth would be steady. Simply put this is your 5 of ongoing declines in this metric, and this year is the worst other than the great recession. And this is in the midst of what has been one of the golden periods for tools. This begs a number of questions. I\u2019ll limit it to three. ","One, what can you point to that would demonstrate that there are not structural issues at Waters that are different from the peer group? Two, have competitive dynamics intensified, leading to share loss that you would now acknowledge? And three, why is a continuation of the share buyback, which has arguably depleted the company\u2019s rainy day funds with shares at historically high multiples, the best use of capital moving forward given aforementioned trends and amid concerns about structural and competitive dynamic issues? Thank you. ","Chris O\u2019Connell","Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Okay, you asked three questions there, so I\u2019ll try to take them in order. In terms of the recurring revenue and a reflection of the overall structure of our company relative to our peers, of course, Waters as you know is more concentrated in the pharmaceutical category, particularly the small molecule category. And as I mentioned on the call, we have seen a lengthening of equipment purchasing dynamics in that sector. We\u2019re currently in environment very much driven by macro and to some degree other noise that\u2019s in the environment that has affected the small molecule business of our overall pharma business, our small molecule business, which is LC intensive, is about 70% of our overall pharma business. And currently that\u2019s experiencing more modest growth and certainly there is some impact of recurring revenues that follow from the overall instrument sales. This particular market, which again we do have unique concentration in Doug, as you know, has been steady over time. And while it\u2019s hard to tease out individual cycles, I think there\u2019s no arguing that it\u2019s in the softer phase right now for a number of those reasons that are affecting participants, whether it\u2019s on the generic side or the large pharma side. Our pharma revenue -- our pharma recurring growth, while we don\u2019t break that out, was strong in Q3 and has also been strong throughout this year and last year. And certainly some of the recurring revenues on the industrial side of the business that\u2019s been in a difficult period with global macro has certainly explained that. ","And as it relates to a competitive differentiation, our strongest competitive differentiation is in the pharma sector, particularly in the regulated laboratory environment and late stage development, and QA\/QC. And so, there have been periods over time when the -- when that particular market segment has done very well and grown above the average of tool, other tool categories. And at this point in time, that sector of the market is growing below the average. But I think because of that, we do see the -- some evidence of pent up demand building and have confidence in that end market over the long-term. ","Relative to share loss and your second question, we\u2019ve certainly seen over an extended period of time pressure on our mass spec market share, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested so heavily to reverse that trend and we think we\u2019re really on at a bit of a pivot point relative to the new technology that\u2019s come into the market at both the high end of mass spec as well as in the core tandem quad portfolio, and with a totally new white space opportunity with BioAccord to really improve the mass spec market share position. ","On the LC side, we\u2019ve seen generally stable conditions over time and different dynamics within UPLC, HPLC and UHPLC. But as I mentioned earlier, the strong concentration of Waters and regulated laboratories has been an advantage in stabilizing in keeping that share stable and we continue to invest against that, and in other product categories that you didn\u2019t mention, TA instruments, chemistry informatics and service we\u2019ve seen stable share trends as well. So overall, we\u2019re very focused on competing in a market that is very competitive. Certainly acknowledged strong competition but I like the position we have. ","Relative to the buyback, as you know with U.S. tax reform that came through a year and a half ago or so, we had a one-time opportunity to really reset our balance sheet and work towards in appropriate capital structure that gives us flexibility but also optimizes our balance sheet and our overall weighted average cost of capital. And certainly feel like we have enough flexibility to make the investments we want to make, both capital investments as well as M&A.","Next question, please. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks, Chris, I want to follow up on the U.S. headwinds because obviously last quarter, you were up 7%, pharma up mid-single digit. So this is a pretty decent reversal. It seems like it caught up with you late in the quarter. Can you just give a little more color on how much was pharma, how much was generics. What really does give you confidence in a fourth quarter recovery? Is it the order book? Just curious as to what the drivers of the reversion here are in particular versus some of the comments we\u2019ve heard?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes, thank you, Tycho. Yes, just to confirm, your -- the first part of your question, this was -- in fact it happened quite late in the quarter, as you know more than half of our business comes in the third month of the quarter as just to give some color on where our head was at a quarter ago, we did comment on the fact that coming out of the chute in the beginning of the quarter we saw the continuation of trends we had seen in Q2, which as I mentioned in my prepared remarks reinforced the view we had on the U.S.","August is always a little bit variable with vacation periods and September ended up being a lot weaker than we expected. And really the only thing I can point to in general is just a lot of noise in the market right now, whether it\u2019s industry litigation or M&A, or certainly on the generic side some of the effects later in the government year on the generic user fee increase. There\u2019s just a bunch of different factors that make for a more noisy market than is expected. ","I\u2019ve had the chance to personally with the team evaluate a number of the large orders that we expected, that we had forecast internally within the third quarter and I\u2019m confident that those orders which come from well known customers, strong customers, have been delayed and not lost or cancelled. And so that has given us confidence to suggest that the U.S. ought to be better in Q4 than it was in Q3 and year-to-date. But we\u2019re certainly also being pragmatic and cautious in assuming overall trends for the year continue. And therefore, our assumptions for Q4 do not include a large budget flush. Certainly if a large budget flush were to materialize, as it has in the past, that would represent upside to our numbers, but we\u2019re not forecasting that at this point.","Tycho Peterson","And then for the follow up I want to hone in a little bit on the China dynamics. Can you give us some color on how much China pharma grew? And then as we think about 4+7, you talked about the bidding process beginning in September. We\u2019ve heard anecdotally, maybe a third of the labs will go away. So how do we get comfortable this isn\u2019t a bit of a false bottom here? And then also, it seems like some of the Indian generic companies are also participating in 4+7. I think Dr. Reddy\u2019s won a tender. So just curious how you think about the trade off in growth between China local generic and India pharma? ","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes. We\u2019re certainly learning as we go. It\u2019s an interesting environment there. As we know, Q1, really the market went on hold and it came back in Q2 and Q3, it was solid as well. We had double-digit growth in China pharma in the third quarter. And what we\u2019ve seen there is that even as 4+7 extends to a broader part of the market, the second phase of bidding in September was the same 25 drugs that we had seen in phase one extending to 27 provinces. About 60% of the participants in the phase two tender were the same companies that participated in the first round of the tender and about 40% were new. But just about all of the major bidders in the process were companies that you would consider to be in the top 100 within China. ","To your point about foreign participation, the first phase was almost entirely local China companies, larger China companies in that larger category. In the second phase, we did see an increased participation of the non-Chinese companies, it was about an 85%, 15% mix between China and the non-Chinese companies. So, for example, the Indian company you referenced is an example of the type of companies that are making up that 15% in the second phase. ","Like we\u2019ve stated before, the big picture here is that this effort is being done to enhance the overall access of medications to the population and therefore volumes will be increasing. And so, these are long-term positive -- these initiatives are long-term positive for volume in the market and testing volume. And it does also lead to some change in the market. Some of the companies for example that have not won some of these tenders don\u2019t necessarily leave the industry altogether, they have focused on other things. So we have some examples of generic companies leaving the generic space and getting involved in new drug development for example. ","So it is still a dynamic situation playing out but at least in the two quarters we\u2019ve just reported most recently, Q2 and Q3, we\u2019ve seen a stabilization of that demand. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik De Bruin","So, a couple of questions. So first of all, I wanted to follow up on something that Doug asked. So in the HPLC, UPLC market, typically those instruments have a five to eight year life cycle, life span in them and the upgrade cycle we went through in LC ended in 2017. And clearly we\u2019re getting some changes in terms of the generic manufacturer in U.S. and China, Tycho referenced companies going out of business, essentially. I guess just what gives you confidence that we should see a rebound in LC instruments in 2020? Is the first question.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes, thanks a lot, Derik. I want to do as much as I can to provide color on some of the market dynamic that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date now that we\u2019re through three quarters. But I also want to balance that with the fact that fourth quarter is our biggest quarter and a lot can play out in fourth quarter. And so before we put too fine a point on the trends in the market that would underscore our guidance for 2020, we want to see the fourth quarter play out. As you know, in some markets, this business, the LC business in particular has become pretty backend weighted. And we\u2019ve seen in some years a significant increase in business in the fourth quarter that creates an overall story for a kind of a rolling analysis. And so we want to see that play out. ","Like I said earlier, we\u2019re not assuming a big flush at the end of the quarter. And that\u2019s why we put the guidance where it is just for caution and conservatism purposes, but we do want to see it play out before we say too much about what we expect out of LC instruments in 2020. But like I mentioned earlier, the LC, the small mol LC market has been reliable historically. We are currently seeing more modest growth and believe that to some extent demand is building for investment in that area as we step into the next several years. So, we\u2019re watching it closely. We want to see what fourth quarter trends look like. And also keep in mind that when you think about the LC business, and the increase of focus on mass spec based workflows that we\u2019re seeing in the market, particularly in large molecule that LCs are an important component and with just about every mass spec system we sell, LCs come along with it. So, we\u2019re looking at LC in both the standalone LC optical market, if you will, as well as the LC-MS market.","Derik De Bruin","Great. And can you talk a little bit about the European markets, just maybe some comments on Eastern versus Western Europe food, environmental, academic, governant, just a little bit more color there? And the shift of the question being is, how much uncertainty you think Brexit has caused across the European markets? Thank you.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure. Thanks. Yes, Europe has been a fairly challenging operating environment this year and just to recap the numbers overall for Europe, it was flat in the quarter and is down 2% for the year. That\u2019s -- that includes an overall European pharma number that is 1% up in the quarter and 1% up year-to-date with actually a pretty decent academic and government market up double-digits both quarter-to-date and year-to-date offsetting a similar range of declines for the industrial market. Some of the trends we\u2019ve seen year-to-date -- quarter-to-date was actually a little better in Europe industrial at a mid single-digit decline versus a double-digit decline for the year-to-date. So even though the numbers are still negative in European industrial there, they\u2019ve gotten incrementally better in the third quarter, and that\u2019s really a kind of a combination of the chemical materials market and TA being flatter, and the food and environmental market being down overall. ","In terms of the overall environment, there\u2019s enough economic data including PMI that shows a kind of a flat to contracting economic growth environment. And certainly Brexit delays, as you mentioned, are front of mind. And we felt that through the Brexit process, much sentiment is on hold. And we do believe that in that process, there is some pent up demand building, particularly in the UK, in the Northern parts of Europe. And so we\u2019re really trying to look ahead and see when we might see an improving picture, but it\u2019s -- Europe has been kind of a flattish scenario all year long. And that said, we\u2019re super confident in our competitive position throughout Europe and believe that the concentrations we have in certain sectors are really -- provide the right context for what\u2019s happening there. But believe we\u2019re poised particularly with our new product flow to take advantage of improving market conditions when they come.","Okay, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Brennan, UBS. Your line is open. ","Dan Brennan","Great, thanks for thanks for the questions. So, Chris, I want to just look at China. Could you provide some color within China regarding food versus industrial versus pharma. You made some comments in your prepared remarks I think signaling kind of macros having an impact. And I know food has been a bigger drag for you. So anyway, if you could just separate out your key areas within China, kind of how they did and kind of what you\u2019re expecting going forward?","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure. Thanks, Dan. So China was up 2% for the quarter and it\u2019s up 1% year-to-date and the year-to-date obviously incorporates the decline we saw in Q1 with a bit more stability in Q2 and Q3, particularly on the pharma side. And like I mentioned earlier, the pharma business was up double-digits in China and has solidified in the -- as the 4+7 program as we talked about has matured a little bit at least and has more visibility. And really the rest of the business is flattish on the industrial side. It was flat in the quarter and is down 1% for the year. And then on the academic and government side is where we\u2019ve actually seen much more of the pressure, which is down double-digits. And that\u2019s really a function of the food market. As you know, the bulk of our food testing business has been in government-oriented labs, and that\u2019s as the market makes a transition from the government focus on food testing, where government labs are doing the bulk of the testing to one where they\u2019re in more of a supervisory role, that particular market has been somewhat disruptive. We do see a number of dynamics there. Even though the demand has been soft on the government side, we expect an increase in growth in the future on the private side and, and even to some degree a privatization of what previously were government labs. ","And so, that process of privatization within the government testing environment as well as the uptake in the third-party testing lab sector has caused this disruption, and to your point, food, as the years played out has provided most of the pressure in our business there, while pharma has recovered. The industrial environment is a bit muted based on the overall economic conditions but it\u2019s really been in that government area and the food testing. ","I will say in the food area another important comment though just looking at the market, it\u2019s a pretty mass spec heavy market with a focus on tandem quads. And we\u2019ve really strengthened our portfolio in tandem quads this year with the introduction of the cronos and the TQ-S micro. And that gives us a lot more flexibility particularly in the mid and lower tiers of tandem quad testing. And I think we could argue that we have across the board the strongest or one of the strongest tandem quad portfolios in the industry and feel very good about our ability to compete in that market and to serve the different segments of the market as they develop. So we\u2019re glad with the investments we\u2019ve made on the mass spec side and that will show through particular in the tandem quad business. And obviously we\u2019re working as hard as we can to understand when that demand might return and how to make sure we\u2019re well positioned to win a lot of it.","Dan Brennan","And then this is a follow-up. So on the new products side Chris I know in your prepared remarks you talked about meaningful revenue contribution. I know you\u2019re not going to give us a number right now. But at least could you just discuss with the fourth quarter kind of what assume from new products? And then is there any way to just kind of categorize how to think about what the potential of all these new products that you\u2019re rolling out could be since it\u2019s such a critical part I think of kind of your story and kind of strategy shift that you\u2019ve made at Waters? Thank you.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes. Thanks, Dan. And absolutely job one at Waters is new product innovation. And we\u2019re in the midst of a significant transformation of our R&D efforts and really the continued achievement of innovation leadership. I think a lot of those efforts are going really well. We\u2019re extremely encouraged by the products that have come through the pipeline already with a pretty heavy focus on mass spec, given the growth opportunities in the mass spec markets as well as competitive position that we needed to improve. That was clearly the case. But kind of furthermore on the innovation side with the increases in investment, we\u2019ve built a really robust five year product roadmap that we have more clarity than we\u2019ve ever had at Waters in terms of a cadence of new product introductions across instruments, chemistries. And of course, we\u2019ll be talking a lot more about informatics in the years to come with the Waters Connect platform.","Just a couple of quick notes on the products we\u2019ve launched, there are different type of products, of course, we\u2019ve made a number of different key line extensions on the LC side that are maybe a little bit below the radar screen, but really enhance our industry leading LC portfolio, particularly on the bio side with our Arc Bio and H-Class Bio and the binary pump and a number of other products we\u2019ve put into the market this year, certainly the chemistries that go along with the LC portfolio. I mentioned a new family of HPLC chemistries, the focus family, and of course everything we\u2019re doing in bioseparations.","But mass spec has really been the headline this year, BioAccord is a game changer. It is really white space opportunity in the sense of bringing highly usable, high quality, very easy to use time-of-flight mass spectrometry into the regulated laboratory space in late development and ultimately QA\/QC. I\u2019ve had a chance to personally visit three or four customers this quarter who have bought BioAccord and the feedback is very positive. So, we\u2019re encouraged there.","The activities in the third quarter did not have as big of an impact in the third quarter. It should have a bigger impact in Q4. The tandem quads, I mentioned cronos and micro, but we did sell an encouraging number of the Cyclic IMSs in the quarter and have an even bigger order book for Q4. And then, the SYNAPT XS system which we announced the launch of in the third quarter, we did not ship in the quarter and we have communicated that -- we did communicate that to our customers. And so, we certainly have a bigger opportunity in Q4 than we had in Q3 relative to the high-res portfolio and we expect the SYNAPT XS, which is a dramatic enhancement in our well accepted SYNAPT QTOF platform. We certainly have an opportunity to ship that product this quarter that we didn\u2019t have last quarter.","So, that\u2019s some more color on all the new product launches. And again, I don\u2019t want to put too fine a point on a specific contribution in the fourth quarter, but we certainly expect it to increasingly be visible. And as we roll into next year with these launches under our belt, I think we\u2019ll be in a position as we guide for 2022 to put some more specificity around that.","Dan Brennan ","Great, thank you.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Thanks, Dan. Next question please.","Bryan Brokmeier ","Operator, is there another question in the queue?","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Beuchaw with Wolfe Research.","Stephen Beuchaw ","First, I actually want to follow up on a point that the Doug alluded to, it has to do with capital deployment. If I think back to the beginning of the year, you -- well, it actually goes even into the fourth quarter of the prior year. You made a commitment to not just doing the $2.5 billion but also to getting to a leverage target that implies that you continue to buy back stock beyond 2019. Are you still committed to going to that leverage target?","Sherry Buck ","Hi Steve, this is Sherry. So yes, so just to go back a little bit with the availability of our cash, as a result of tax reform, we did a lot of work and analysis and wanted to our balance sheet to work. And we communicated our share buyback program for the year of $2.5 billion and we\u2019re working toward that as reflected in our guide. And then as we look at overall capital structure and optimizing that capital structure, 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA ratio is still a near-term goal. And I would say, as we end the year we\u2019ll probably be about 2 times with our guidance around the share buyback. So, we\u2019ll look at our 2020 plans and give some more details around what our specific guidance for next year, but that is still a goal we\u2019re working toward but not obviously for this year.","Stephen Beuchaw ","Okay, perfect. And then, Chris, I should\u2019ve opened the door in a different kind of way. There have been a lot of really good questions asked here in the Q&A with people focusing on customer demands, competitive demands, R&D, macro. These are all important parts of a sort of broader conversation around -- what do you own when you own Waters as a stock, right. If I talk to an investor who owns Waters, they\u2019re generally talking to me about how much appeal they see because of the likely sustainability of the growth of pill count. And that should mean that you get to mid-single digit growth. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get questions on this topic from a lot of investors in coming weeks and months.","So I guess now that we\u2019re at this point in the year and we\u2019ve learned a few things, a few things we didn\u2019t know even six months ago, how do you talk to that investor about that path back to mid-single digit growth? Is that the right way to think about things? Thanks so much.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure, yes. No, of course all efforts, Steve, are focused on returning to better -- much better growth. And we\u2019ve certainly seen better growth in different instrument cycles within the specific categories we focus in. At the end of the day, I think a lot about the markets we participate in and want to make sure Waters is well positioned in structurally attractive markets. And even putting aside cycles and different macroeconomic conditions, we still fundamentally believe that the attractiveness of the pharma and biopharma space is very high, and furthermore that there is an accelerating innovation story in material science and food safety testing and some of the other markets we\u2019re in.","So, we\u2019re really focused on the fundamentals of those markets and believe that some of the things you mentioned around the sustainability of the pill count and prescription volume and patient access to medication on the small molecule, the generic side and also the innovation on the large molecule side are all very, very good markets to participate in.","And our ability proven over time and we believe we\u2019re in a new phase of proving it all over again in terms of the ability to lead the market with meaningful innovation in these spaces, which will then have a downstream impact on a strong recurring revenue stream with consumables. And service is a great place to be as the company that can generate very high returns on invested capital and over different cycles market leading organic growth.","I think the incremental opportunity we have since tax reform is to add to that with deploying capital to growth activities, whether it\u2019s a faster pace of capital investment in the company or tuck-in M&A as we see it, we\u2019ve certainly been active in the M&A space in the recent past. And while we\u2019ve not gone forward, given our level of discipline and focus on things that will make the biggest difference, that will be over time an added opportunity to generate returns of our capital that we generate in the business.","So, that\u2019s how I think about it. And ultimately, making sure we make the right investments, allocate our capital both internally and externally to earn the type of returns that Waters has so consistently delivered over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Willoughby, Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess two things; first, Chris, if you could just -- I guess asking about new products in a different way, the company has had to guide down organic growth 3 times so far this year. And I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for kind of what were you expecting the impact or contribution from new products this year at the beginning of the year as compared to now? And then I have a follow-up for Sherry.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Yes, Steve, I think we were -- we always had modest expectations and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t put too fine a point on a number. Certainly, we expected toward the back half of the year to see more of an impact on that. And obviously, with our largest quarter ahead of us, Q4 accounts for 30% of the year in terms of our historical averages of the third quarter. We want to make sure we see fourth quarter play out and do expect to see a bigger impact. But overall for the year, we expected a modest impact.","And so, in terms of what\u2019s played out, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the muted capital purchasing environment and some of the macro-dynamics we\u2019ve spoken about probably had somewhat of a moderating effect on that impact, but that\u2019s why we focus on some of those underlying metrics of market development that I have continuously alluded to, to gauge our progress. And ideally what that adds up to here is strengthening in the fourth quarter and setting the stage for an even bigger impact in 2020.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Your line is open.","Vijay Kumar ","I had one China question and one guidance. Maybe I\u2019ll start with China. Chris, maybe -- you mentioned some comments on food. Is that end market graph maybe stabilizing, improving or maybe not better, worsened? And I\u2019m also curious, we hear noise on this round two of 4 by 7. Should we think of that as incremental or is this already being accounted by customers, given that they knew the second round was coming?","Chris O\u2019Connell ","Yes, thanks, Vijay. I\u2019m happy to take those, and welcome to coverage of the name. I know you\u2019re not new to the space overall but new to us, so welcome. And in terms of China, it\u2019s hard to say where to call the current short-term trend right now and we want to see another quarter or two. I don\u2019t think we have any expectation that food is going to jump back this quarter. There is a transition going on in the market.","If you look at the China food market from a bigger picture perspective, food had a really great run in China in the sort of \u201815 to \u201817 time frame in the relative recent past. And it\u2019s a market that, as I mentioned before, has been very oriented to government laboratories that\u2019s changing. It\u2019s changing for the right reasons because a lot of the testing infrastructure is being pushed out into the community. And there will be a privatization process underway there, which we think is ultimately going to lead to a return of really favorable growth conditions. And as I mentioned before, our improving tandem quad portfolio is going to be well timed for when that comes back, But again, it\u2019s -- don\u2019t have enough visibility to call a rebound in the immediate future here.","And just a small point on 4+7, then I\u2019ll let you ask your Sherry question since we\u2019re running a little low on time. But the -- we do learn more incrementally. We do have a pretty good feel for what the second phase has brought. And we see confidence on the part of the largest companies that are participating and doing well in those tenders. And as I believe Tycho asked earlier, beginning to see the participation of some major global companies as well in the process. But again, that process is all about growth and managing price through these tenders in a way that gives the government confidence that can support the growth that\u2019s being demanded by their population.","Was there a financial question?","Bryan Brokmeier ","I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Jack Meehan, Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan ","Chris, I guess just given some of the recent growth trends, I wanted to prod a little bit more on capital deployment. You\u2019ve talked a couple of times about tuck-in M&A. Just curious, earlier this year, you changed the credit agreement to allow for increased leverage for deals over $400 million. If you did a deal that size, would you consider that additive to the buyback plan? And are you looking at assets of that size? I\u2019m just curious if there is any additional color you could give around the pipeline. Thanks.","Chris O\u2019Connell","Sure. Yes, Jack, let me take -- thanks for the question. And let me take the first part of that and have Sherry comment as well. Yes, we\u2019ve been investing internally in a capability for M&A to add some -- to add to our portfolio in advanced and adjacent technologies with a very rigorous strategic financial and execution framework. And I would characterize the assets we\u2019re looking at as more in the small to mid size, more in the tuck-in category is -- we certainly have a lot of flexibility in our balance sheet to do everything we\u2019re looking at and obviously want to make sure that we can be opportunistic where it\u2019s appropriate. But I\u2019ll have Sherry comment a little further on the covenants and so forth.","Sherry Buck ","Right. Yes, so we updated some of our agreements and with the recent offering that we made, it was just bringing all of them in line with language that we already had as far as what our leverage ratios are. So, it\u2019s maybe just a little bit of housekeeping on that. But as far as our overall capital structure, we\u2019ve talked about working through a near-term leverage ratio of 2.5 times. And certainly, if there is a right asset that makes sense for us from our strategic goals and our strategy, we\u2019d be willing and have the flexibility, as Chris mentioned, to lever up. And we\u2019ve got the covenants in place to cover that.","Chris O\u2019Connell ","Good. Thanks. Sherry, and thanks everybody for your participation and questions. We\u2019re going to wrap up the call now. Just a note of conclusion here. Despite the more challenging capital purchasing dynamics that we\u2019ve talked about this year, 2019 has been an important year for Waters in setting the stage for an exciting multiyear product cycle. We\u2019ve begun to see the early outputs of our significant recent investment in R&D and are encouraged by early customer response. We expect to see increasing sales contribution from our newly commercialized products as well as those still to come over the coming quarters and years.","So on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2019 call, which we currently anticipate holding on February 04, 2020. Thank you, and have a great day.","Operator","And thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines and we appreciate your business. Thank you."]}}
